<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of GS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that a recently identified molecular marker for GS (a TA insertion in the promoter of UGT1A, the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Transcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> index was measured shortly after birth and daily for the first week of life in 151 healthy infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from blood or buccal brushings, and the UGT1A promoter was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction to yield 90 (A[TA]6TAA, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) or 92 (A[TA]7TAA, GS) base pair products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis used Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, and Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen (13%) subjects were homozygous for the A(TA)7TAA polymorphism associated with GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The A(TA)7TAA homozygotes had a greater increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> index during the first 2 days of life than heterozygotes or A(TA)6TAA homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although peak <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> levels did not differ among groups, newborn infants with the molecular marker for GS have an accelerated increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> during the first 2 days of life </plain></SENT>
