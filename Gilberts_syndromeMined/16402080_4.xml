<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups </plain></SENT>
