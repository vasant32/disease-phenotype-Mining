<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the alelle (TA)(7) associated with GS found in this study were 0.324, 0.407, and 0.328, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies differed significantly between Caucasians and African-derived individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high frequencies of (TA)(7) polymorphism among the three groups confirm previous data that this polymorphism is very ancient and appears to be distributed throughout the world </plain></SENT>
