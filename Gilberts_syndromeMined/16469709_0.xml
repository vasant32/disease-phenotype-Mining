<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To learn the variation in the gene for UGT1A1 enzyme, the genetic mechanism in a Chinese Han nationality family suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At first, genomic DNA from peripheral blood of the sufferer in this family was used for amplifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the five exons of the UGT1A1 gene by PCR, and then direct sequencing of the PCR product was applied to analyze gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there existed a G--&gt;A homozygous transition at nucleotide 211 leading the substitution of arginine for glycine at position 71 of corresponding protein product (G71R) and a T--&gt;G homozygous transition at nucleotide 1456 leading the substitution of aspartic acid for tyrosine at position 486 of corresponding protein product (Y486D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mutation was detected in promoter region and the splicing junction sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relevant mutation sites of the other family members were sequenced and identified to be heterozygous in the two above-mentioned mutation sites and in the TA repeat mutation in the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fresh blood samples were collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the members to detect the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels to determine the sufferer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result was consistent with the mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It could thus be inferred that this family was caused by mutation in the open reading frame of the gene UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
