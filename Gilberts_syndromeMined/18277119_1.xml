<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The genetic polymorphism responsible from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is not sufficient for the clinical phenotype to occur in many persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional factors are believed to contribute in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Red cell mass may be such a factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have retrospectively evaluated computer records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> liver function tests assayed between January 2005 and February 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The database was screened to find cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver enzymes and blood count values on simultaneous assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group for comparison of surrogate markers of total red cell mass comprised of age- and gender-matched persons who had laboratory tests with completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results on the same day with the hyperbilirubinemic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> cases were found with medical record assessment, and these cases and their control subjects were more strictly assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three different control groups were established for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> cases, one of them including healthy blood donors and personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 48,516 otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laboratory test results, we have found that 491 male subjects and 323 female subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> had higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, hematocrit, and red blood cell values compared with age- and gender-matched control subjects (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six males who had been followed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> also showed higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, hematocrit and red cell count values in comparison to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean red cell volume value did not differ between the hyperbilirubinemic persons and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relatively increased red cell mass probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
