<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have evaluated gas exchange and the safety of PLV in adult patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> whose gas exchange was partially provided by extracorporeal life support (ECLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first experience with adult patients who were not on ECLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intratracheal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38803">perflubron</z:chebi> in a total dose of 30.1 +/- 7.1 ml/kg was administered over a period of 45 +/- 9 hours to nine adult patients with mean age = 49 +/- 4 years and mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio = 128 +/- 7 as part of a prospective, multicenter, phase I-II noncontrolled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant decreases in mean (A-a)DO2 (baseline = 430 +/- 47, 48 hour = 229 +/- 17, p = 0.0127 by ANOVA) and FiO2 (baseline = 0.82 +/- 0.08, 48 hour = 0.54 +/- 0.06, p = 0.025), along with an increase in mean SvO2 (baseline = 75 +/- 3, 48 hour = 85 +/- 2, p = 0.018 by ANOVA) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in pulmonary compliance or hemodynamic variables were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of the nine patients in this study survived beyond 28 days after initiation of partial liquid ventilation whereas 5 patients survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three adverse events [<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (1)] were determined to be severe in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PLV may be performed safely with few related severe adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement in gas exchange was observed in this series of adult patients over the 48 hours after initiation of PLV </plain></SENT>
