<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine whether a prognostic score is a useful indicator of donor safety using 13 consecutive donors enrolled for liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The donor operations were right hepatic lobectomies (n = 10) and left hepatic lobectomies (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative maximal level of serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was used to assess the magnitude of surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables such as donor age, percentage of liver resection (PLR), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> 15-minute retention rate (ICGR15), operative blood loss, operation time, prognostic score and graft weight were evaluated as predictors of the magnitude of surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PLR and prognostic score (PS) were calculated according to the following formulae: PLR (%) = 100*Graft weight (g)/standard liver volume of the donor (mL); PS = -84.6 + 0.933*PLR (%) +1.11*ICGR15 (%) +0.999*age (years); Standard liver volume (mL) = 706.2*body surface area (m2) + 2.39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No serious complications occurred after the donor operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> ranged from 1.9 to 10.9 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no mortalities, although there were two morbidities, bile leakage and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was observed in two donors and in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis of each variable indicated poor correlations between those variables and maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, close correlations were seen between maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and both donor age and PS except for the three patients who showed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these uneventful donors, statistical formulae were obtained as follows: maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (PMB) = 0.271 + 0.056*donor age (correlation coefficient 0.612, P &lt; .008), PMB = 1.541 + 0.059*PS (correlation coefficient 0.597, P &lt; .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PS is useful to predict maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and to ensure donor safety </plain></SENT>
