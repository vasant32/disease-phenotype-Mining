<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Kodak Ektachem method and a diazotized sulfanilic acid method with 0.15 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentrations are the only methods that gave accurate direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> values, as judged by liquid-chromatographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aca</z:e> method that involved p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27798">nitrobenzene</z:chebi> diazonium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38899">tetrafluoroborate</z:chebi> and another diazotized sulfanilic acid method with a higher concentration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (0.8 mmol/L) yielded falsely high values for direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, which could lead to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The more recently introduced diazotized sulfanilic acid method of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aca</z:e> gave substantially better results than the p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27798">nitrobenzene</z:chebi> diazonium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38899">tetrafluoroborate</z:chebi> method but was still inaccurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systematic investigation of these procedures revealed that the overestimation of direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> by the diazotized sulfanilic acid method was related to the amount of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> present and its ability to react as direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in the presence of higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inherent properties of p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27798">nitrobenzene</z:chebi> diazonium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38899">tetrafluoroborate</z:chebi> appeared to be responsible for inaccuracies in that method, which could not be corrected by varying reagent concentration or the reaction conditions </plain></SENT>
