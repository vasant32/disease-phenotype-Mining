<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical picture of the disease in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample consisted of 17 patients of mean age 11.9 +/- 5.4 yr (range 18-33 yr) and one older patient (age 44 yr), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Israeli Bedouins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was evaluated as well as the extent of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each subject we determined the <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> gene mutations and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> dyphosphate-glucoronosyltransferase (UGT-1A) gene polymorphism associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were found to have moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, with the women displaying lower mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels than the men (8.2 +/- 0.9 g dL(-1) vs. 10 +/- 1.3 g dL(-1); P=0.0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (59%) had received at least one blood transfusion, with the women having a significantly higher transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000823'>delayed puberty</z:hpo> was noted, final height and weight were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, and eight patients had progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biliary stones were found in three of 16 patients, two of whom were homozygous for UGT-1A gene polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients carried the common <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> gene mutation, although serum ferritin levels were moderately elevated (788 +/- 332 ng mL(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> type I in young adults is characterized by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, more severe in women, and a tendency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> and secondary progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in this patient population should be monitored and chelation therapy initiated when indicated to prevent organ damage </plain></SENT>
