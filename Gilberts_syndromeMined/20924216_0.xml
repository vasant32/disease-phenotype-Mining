<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it is difficult to diagnose HS in the absence of signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, we evaluated both the genetic mutation in the UGT1A1 gene and abnormalities in the erythrocyte membrane protein; the former was heterozygous for a UGT1A1 allele with three mutations and the latter was partially deficient in ankyrin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the concomitance of HS and GS with three heterozygous mutations [T-3279G, A (TA)7TAA, and G211A] in the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
