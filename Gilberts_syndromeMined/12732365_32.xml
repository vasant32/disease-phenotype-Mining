<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a TATA box mutation of UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28), a common genotype leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and several missense mutations of other <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family members have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the basis for co-occurrence of UGT1 mutations, fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques were developed for rapid determination of polymorphisms of three UGT isoforms (UGT1A1*28, 1A6*2, and 1A7*2/*3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hundred healthy Caucasians and 50 Egyptians were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genotypes followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only three major haplotypes were found, including a haplotype consisting of allelic variants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three isoforms (29% in Caucasians and 22% in Egyptians), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leading to reduced UGT activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequent haplotypes containing several UGT1 allelic variants should be taken into account in studies on the association between diseases, abnormal drug reactions, and UGT1 family polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
