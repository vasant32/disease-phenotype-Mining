<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is known to correlate with altered clearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>) and drugs such as 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this polymorphism is clinically relevant and leads to significant drug-related toxicity of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11, in vitro tools to allow prediction of how it will affect the clearance of new chemical entities have not been completely developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To allow a more complete assessment of whether new chemical entities will be affected by the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, a panel of microsomes was prepared from 15 donor livers genotyped as UGT1A1*1/*1, UGT1A1*1/*28, and UGT1A1*28/*28 (five donors per genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microsomes were phenotyped by measuring activities of a panel of substrates, both those reported to be conjugated specifically by UGT1A1 or by other <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (3-OH), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> (3-OH), and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) were found to show significantly lower rates of metabolism in the UGT1A1*28/*28 microsomes with no change in K(m) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, microsomes genotyped as UGT1A1*1/*28 showed intermediate rates of metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10110">3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine</z:chebi>, muraglitazar, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (17-OH), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> (17-OH) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found to show similar rates of metabolism regardless of UGT1A1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, muraglitazar (UGT1A3 substrate) showed an inverse correlation with glucuronidation of UGT1A1 substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These genotyped microsomes should provide a useful tool to allow a more comprehensive prediction of UGT1A1 metabolism of a new drug and gain insight into the effect of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
