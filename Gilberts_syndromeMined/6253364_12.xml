<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of cholecystectomy, the stones were taken for analysis in 48 of 81 patients, and a bile sample was obtained in 42 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the stones, 75% were cholesterol stones, 15% <z:mp ids='MP_0010374'>pigment stones</z:mp>, and 10% 'intermediate' stones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low hepatic conjugating activity was not preferentially associated with a given type of stone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between the enzymic deficiency and the biliary cholesterol saturation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronide (over 40%) was found in four of seven patients with low transferase activity, as was earlier demonstrated in patients with overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raised biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronide was also found in three patients, out of 46, who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transferase but raised biliary beta-glucuronidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that deficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation could be a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo>: the activity of another hepatic microsomal enzyme, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphatase, taken as a reference, was measured in 12 patients and was always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the very high frequency of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> centre in the cholesterol stones (87% of the cases in the present series), it is suggested that the increased proportion in poorly soluble biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronide, which was associated with defective conjugation, could act as a trigger for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> initiation, regardless of the final composition of the stone </plain></SENT>
