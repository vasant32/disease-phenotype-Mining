<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six (46) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> to the liver from various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> despite polychemotherapy, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had baseline computed tomography (CT), 18-Fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (F-18 FDG-PET), hepatic angiography, and intra-arterial Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) scan for the assessment of extrahepatic aberrant perfusion and lung shunting fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (27) and 19 patients were treated with Y-90 glass- or resin-based microspheres (but not both), respectively, on a lobar basis and were monitored over 3 months after last treatment using dedicated attenuation corrected PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each patient, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn along the liver edge to measure total liver standard uptake value (SUV) on axial images covering the entire liver for comparing pre- and post-treatment total liver SUV change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant decrement in total liver SUV after treatment by either glass- or resin-based microspheres (p = 0.0013 and 0.028, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the amplitudes of the mean percentage reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism between these two agents (20% +/- 25% vs. 10% +/- 30% for glass- vs. resin-based microspheres; p = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in the glass-based group developed complications, whereas 3 patients had complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (1 transient and 2 permanent) in the resin-based group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that there is significant mean reduction of hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> load (metabolism), as evaluated objectively by PET after Y-90 microsphere, for the treatment of unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Y-90 therapy provides encouraging and safe results by arresting the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> to the liver with decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism </plain></SENT>
