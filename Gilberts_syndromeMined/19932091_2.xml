<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is a 70% reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation which, in the Caucasian population, is the result of a homozygous TA insertion into the promoter region of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene (UGT1A128 allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, homozygous subjects for UGT1A128 genotype may suffer from severe irinotecan toxicity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> during treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37924">atazanavir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these reasons it is very important to perform a correct molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe for the first time a new high resolution melting (HRM) analysis for a rapid UGT1A1 (TA)(n) genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened the TA number repetitions of the TATA-box promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene in 30 patients attending the Gemelli Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the reliability of this technique, we compared the results obtained by HRM and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since the TA insertion modifies the derivative melting curve shape and the melting temperature (T(m)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible genotypes for the 6 and 7 repeat alleles were successfully identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRM analysis for the UGT1A1 (TA)(n) genotyping is a simple, rapid, sensitive and low cost method, very useful in diagnostics </plain></SENT>
