<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reference intervals that incorporate genetic information could reduce the misidentification of unusual test results caused by non-disease-associated genetic variation and increase the detection of results indicating underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subdividing reference groups by genetic effects, however, may lead to increased uncertainty around reference interval endpoints (because of the smaller subgroup sample sizes), thus offsetting any benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated CLSI guidelines to develop a method appropriate for partitioning reference intervals on the basis of genetic variants with dominant or recessive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method uses information available before reference samples are recruited, thus allowing a preliminary decision regarding partitioning to be made before sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used this method to evaluate the example of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The decision point for partitioning occurs when the percentage of total variance attributable to a dominant or recessive genetic polymorphism exceeds 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, partitioning decision curves are presented based on difference in means between 2 subgroups, sample SD, and subgroup or allele frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory-specific partitioned reference intervals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> appear to be statistically warranted for white and African-American populations, but not for Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present a simple method to evaluate whether partitioning based on dominant or recessive genetic effects is statistically justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Important limitations remain that, in many situations, will preclude integration of genetic, laboratory, and clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As society moves toward personalized medicine, additional research is needed on how to evaluate patient normality while accounting for additive genetic, multigenic, and other multifactorial effects </plain></SENT>
