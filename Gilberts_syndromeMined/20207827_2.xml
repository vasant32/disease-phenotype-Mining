<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of its toxicity remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine whether or not the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> influences the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> during <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study was conducted in four Spanish university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-six acromegalic patients with active disease, resistant to somatostatin analogs, participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of the UGT1A1*28 homozygous and heterozygous genotypes in acromegalic patients was 14 and 44%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (28%) developed liver function test (LFT) abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for more frequent liver function abnormalities in males (70% males vs. 30% females, P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism had a higher incidence of LFT abnormalities than the UGT1A1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (43% carriers vs. 7% <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted when adjusted in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-factors multiple regression analysis [coefficient of determination (R(2)) = 0.463; P = 0.008] for age, gender, alcohol consumption, and UGT1A1*28 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A stepwise multivariate likelihood binary logistic regression analysis (R(2) = 0.40; P = 0.003) identified male gender (beta = 7.21; P = 0.033) and UGT1A1*28 polymorphism (beta = 14.1; P = 0.028) as the only significant predictors for the development of LFT abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1*28 genotype and male gender predict an increased incidence of LFT abnormalities during <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
