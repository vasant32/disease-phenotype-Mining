<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The preoperative evaluation of candidates for such transplants essentially starts with serologic and biochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some potential liver donors with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function test results may have isolated mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (serum indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level &gt; 20.5 μmol/L [1.2 mg/dL]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> condition that is a common cause of nonhemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and its prevalence is 3% to 10% in the healthy US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> episodes are expected in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> when they are exposed to physical stress, such as operative intervention or low energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The liver morphologic findings of these individuals are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; however, there is a debate on the use of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> as living-liver donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the results of right-lobe living-donor hepatectomy of liver donors with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2010, two hundred twenty-five living-donor liver transplants using right-lobe grafts were performed in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Donors with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> were defined as those whose serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level was greater than 20.5 μmol/L (1.2 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of 225 right-lobe living-donor liver transplants were performed using donors with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up after transplant was 34 months (range, 18 to 51 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One week after the operation, the median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level for right-lobe liver donors was 34.5 μmol/L (2.02 mg/dL) (range, 17.1 to 51.3 μmol/L [1 to 3 mg/dL]), and the median prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) was 1.36 (range, 1.1 to 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level of the donors after 6 months was 29 μmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) (range, 20.5 to 41 μmol/L [1.2 to 2.4 mg/dL]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Living-donor liver transplant from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> donors can be safely performed </plain></SENT>
