<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A fatal aircraft accident of a Bo-105 helicopter on May 20, 1996 led to the suspicion that the pilot's raised serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level could have contributed to the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was suspected that an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> beyond 20.52 micromol x L(-1) could disturb visual perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1998 and 1999, 101 pilots with functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, were subjected to perceptual-psychological testing (signal detection test) during their periodic medical examinations at the German Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the psychophysiological testing were compared with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reaction time and perception range increased with age and were independent of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that raised serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels can diminish visual perceptional performance </plain></SENT>
