<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> is known to be associated with decrease in cardiovascular risk in men, but its relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not clearly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in 78 724 health examinees (41 054 men, aged 30-89 years) from 1994 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects with potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary diseases</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence outcome was collected from hospital records of admission attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 1994 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> measurements were divided into 4 levels: 0 to 10.2, 10.3 to 15.3, 15.4 to 22.1, and 22.2 to 34.2 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases was 1137 in men and 827 in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazard models, participants with a higher level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> showed lower hazard ratios in men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> after adjustment for multiple confounding factors compared to the lowest level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90 in level 3; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.89 in level 4; P for trend=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types also decreased as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels increased (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97 in level 3; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94 in level 4; P for trend=0.0071) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these associations were not seen in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> might have some protective function against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in men </plain></SENT>
