<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 245 infants (488 ears) with different high-risk factors, including premature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low-weight</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, asphyxiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e>, were tested by transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and AABR at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pass rate of AABR and that of TEOAE were different for the infants with different high-risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number that passed TEOAE test and referred to AABR test: premature 15 ears, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low-weight</z:hpo> 3 ears, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> 1 ears, for asphyxiation 5 ears, and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> 35ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pass rate of AABR was reduced evidently when infants had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> and the complicated high-risk factors (chi(2) = 35.723, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different high-risk factors produced different pass rates of AABR (chi(2) = 40.556, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-risk factors effect the auditory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pass rate of AABR is reduced evidently when an infant has both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> and the complicated high-risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We should pay attention to these infants in universal newborn hearing screening </plain></SENT>
