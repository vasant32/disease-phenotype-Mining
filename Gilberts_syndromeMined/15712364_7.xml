<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the analysis of UGT1A1 gene in 31 unrelated Crigler-Najjar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis allowed us to identify 22 mutations, 12 of which were not previously described, expanding the spectrum of known UGT1 mutations to 77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Novel mutations, considered pathogenic, including one nonsense mutation, two altered splice sites, one single base deletion and nine missense mutations were identified in coding exons of the UGT1A1gene and flanking introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several novel missense mutations localize in critical domain of UGT1A1 enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the evaluation of Gilbert-type promoter of UGT1A1in Crigler-Najjar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> syndrome patients was performed </plain></SENT>
