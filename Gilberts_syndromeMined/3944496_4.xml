<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hyperbilirubinemic response, expressed as the area under time concentration curve of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (AUCBR, milligrams per deciliter per 240 minutes) was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in patients with GS than in controls and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, in whom no difference was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, comparable values of the hypersideremic effect (AUCFe, milligrams per deciliter per 240 minutes) were noticed among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven consecutive patients with GS, seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and four healthy volunteers, AUCBR, AUCFe, and the NA plasma half-life of the first fast slope of the curve were determined at three different doses of the drug (1.18, 2.95, and 5.90 mumol NA per kilogram body weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant, dose-dependent increase in AUCBR was present in patients with GS, whereas it remained constant both in controls and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NA plasma half-life was also significantly prolonged in GS with each of the three doses, but remained unchanged in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with GS, a linear correlation (r = 0.891, P less than 0.001) was present between AUCBR and NA plasma half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the AUCFe value remained constant at the different doses used in the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
