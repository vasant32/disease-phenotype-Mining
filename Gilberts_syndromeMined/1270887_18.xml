<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this conclusion is based on a very small number of studies with inherent experimental and analytic limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a new experimental approach was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover (BRT), total red blood cell volume (TRCV), and red cell survival were measured in 26 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and 35 patients with various hepatic and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> derived from red blood cell degradation (BRRBC) was calculated from TRCV and the mean red cell life-span, and the difference between BRT and BRRBC, designated "excess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> synthesis (EBS)," was considered to represent the quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> derived from the processes responsible for ELP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer subjects, EBS averaged 1.0 mg. per kilogram per day, and accounted for 25 per cent of daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, results derived by this approach exceeded the range estimated from analysis of "early labeled peak" data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the data in terms of a simple model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> sources was compatible with the hypothesis that EBS consists of an essentially constant component, averaging 0.8 mg. per kilogram per day, presumably derived principally from the liver, and a second component which varies with the erthropoietic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> man the liver may contribute the major fraction of EBS </plain></SENT>
