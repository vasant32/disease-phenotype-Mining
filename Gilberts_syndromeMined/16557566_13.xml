<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> with augmented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> uptake from the intestine and the development of "hyperbilirubinbilia" have been proposed as key factors in <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation in CF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now tested the hypothesis that the coinheritance of the common UGT1A1 promoter mutation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is an additional lithogenic risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation in CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that patients with CF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> are significantly more likely to carry at least one Gilbert UGT1A1 allele compared with stone-free patients (OR 7.3; P = .042) and that these carriers display significantly higher serum levels of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Gilbert UGT1A1 allele increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation in CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This genetic association supports the current concept for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation in CF and suggests that genetic and exogenous sources contributing to hyperbilirubinbilia might be lithogenic in CF patients </plain></SENT>
