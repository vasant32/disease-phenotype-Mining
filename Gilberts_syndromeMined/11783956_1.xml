<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, this opinion is not applicable to newborns as many studies have shown that deficiency in the conjugating ability of the liver, not <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, is the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
