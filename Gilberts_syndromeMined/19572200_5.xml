<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there are 21 human UGT genes identified, and most of them contain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) of the human UGT genes may cause absent or reduced enzyme activity and polymorphisms of UGT have been found to be closely related to altered drug clearance and/or drug response, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unlikely to study the functional impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified nsSNPs in humans using laboratory approach due to its giant number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the potential for bioinformatics approach for the prediction of phenotype based on known nsSNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have identified a total of 248 nsSNPs from human UGT genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two algorithms tools, sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) and polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen), were used to predict the impact of these nsSNPs on protein function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIFT classified 35.5% of the UGT nsSNPs as "deleterious"; while PolyPhen identified 46.0% of the UGT nsSNPs as "potentially damaging" and "damaging" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from the two algorithms were highly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 63 functionally characterized nsSNPs in the UGTs, 24 showed altered enzyme expression/activities and 45 were associated with disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIFT and Polyphen had a correct prediction rate of 57.1% and 66.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate the potential use of bioinformatics techniques to predict genotype-phenotype relationships which may constitute the basis for future functional studies </plain></SENT>
