<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new method based on specific primer extension reactions coupled with plate hybridization for high-throughput genotyping of single-base mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve the switching characteristics of the primer extension reaction, we introduced an artificial mismatch two bases upstream of the 3'-terminal base in the detection primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A set of primers that correspond to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant DNA segments can be used to accurately analyze single-base mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The termini of these primers are at the mutation positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primer extension products produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were captured by an oligonucleotide probe immobilized on the surface of microtiter wells and were detected by a colorimetric assay using the streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the new method to genotype 96 individuals for 211G&gt;A (G71R) and 119 for 1456T&gt;G (Y486D) in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase1A1 gene; the results were completely concordant with those found by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed method includes ordinary PCR and a microplate assay format, and may be used in routine laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
