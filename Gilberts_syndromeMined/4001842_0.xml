<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out to ascertain whether the hepatic handling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> was restricted in the same manner as recently described for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> values before and after caloric restriction, indicating that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> handling was not influenced by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003573'>increased bilirubin</z:hpo> levels obtained after fasting </plain></SENT>
