<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (n = 10) the rise of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was comparable after the two trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (n = 18), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration rose to a much greater extent during the caloric restriction as compared with controls, and to a lesser extent (P less than 0.001) after the bulky diet, as compared with caloric restriction alone in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that a factor originating from the intestine, perhaps a hormone, the release of which is dependent on the presence of food-bulk, plays a role in the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> associated with caloric restriction </plain></SENT>
