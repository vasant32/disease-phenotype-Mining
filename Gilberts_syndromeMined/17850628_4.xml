<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reduction is associated with UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent research also showed that carriage of UGT1A1*6 allele were significantly related with UGT1A7*3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were utilized to determine UGT1A7 and UGT1A1 genes for 207 patients with GS and 207 gender/age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the 207 healthy controls, linkage disequilibrium was observed between -57UGT1A7 and 622UGT1A7 loci (D' = 1.00 and r(2) = 1.00), -57UGT1A7 and 211UGT1A1 loci (D' = 0.72 and r(2) = 0.36), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose-response effect for number of at-risk allele of UGT1A1 and risk for GS was noted (odds ratio (OR) = 8.19 for heterozygous UGT1A1*28 genotype; OR = 124.96 for homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotype; and p for trend &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with combined genotypes carrying UGT1A7 variant alleles and UGT1A1 variant alleles (including UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6) are associated with increased risk of GS (OR = 13.96 for patients with combined genotype carrying at least one variant allele of UGT1A1 and UGT1A7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the -57UGT1A7 (T&gt;G) is highly associated with UGT1A7*3 and moderately associated with 211UGT1A1 (G&gt;A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Certain UGT1A1/UGT1A7 combined genotypes are risk factors of GS </plain></SENT>
