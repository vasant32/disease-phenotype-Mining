<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Axial 5 mm-thick T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI was acquired from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients with GS (n = 24) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients without GS (n = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria and were compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls without GS (n=60) and controls with GS (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity in the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and cerebellum was measured in relation to the signal intensities of the vitreous body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients without GS and the control subjects without or with GS, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients with GS had significantly decreased signal intensity in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the regions measured on T1-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On T2-weighted MRI, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients with GS had significantly increased signal intensity in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the regions measured compared to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients without GS and the control subjects without or with GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>-associated GS have specific changes in signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> with GS produces changes specifically in the frontotemporal cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
