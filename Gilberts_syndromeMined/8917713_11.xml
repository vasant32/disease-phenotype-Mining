<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initial injury in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>) is the destruction of portal bile ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell proliferation in such bile ducts, so we used immunohistochemical techniques to locate molecules related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> [Fas antigen, Lewis Y antigen (BM1/JIMRO), and bcl-2 protein] and to cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) in 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, nick-end labelling was done to locate DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of these molecules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonsuppurative destructive <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (CNSDC) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and PCNA expression were both found in portal bile ducts affected by CNSDC in 7 of the 13 CNSDC patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fas antigen was found on the plasma membrane and rough endoplasmic reticulum of bile-duct cells with CNSDC in the frozen sections of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients with CNSDC out of the 9 patients inspected, and this antigen was found also in bile-duct cells without CNSDC in 2 of these 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was not found in anatomically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver (from 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Lewis Y antigen was found in bile ducts with CNSDC and in proliferated ductules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No bcl-2 protein was found in any bile-duct or ductule cells, but it was found in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes surrounding or invading CNSDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was found in the nuclei of bile-duct cells with CNSDC by nick-end labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might be involved in CNSDC, but that bcl-2 protein seems to participate less than Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the Lewis Y antigen was found in many bile ducts, the relationship between the antigen and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> remains unknown because there was no evidence that this antigen mediates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
