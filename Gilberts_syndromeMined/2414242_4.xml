<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 ABR and 32 AMR assessments were carried out at bedside in varied hospital environments, including a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), a neonatal ICU and an operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical entities were distributed as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, severe head injury (5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002475'>meningomyelocele</z:hpo> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (1), ototoxic drug overdose (1), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Auditory evoked responses were applied in monitoring peripheral and central auditory system status, and contributed to medical, surgical and audiologic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of the ABR were reversed in some children, such as those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, with medical or surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other cases, such as a hyperbilirubinemic child, a marked ABR abnormality apparently reversed spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present five cases to illustrate diverse applications of serial auditory evoked response measures in children </plain></SENT>
