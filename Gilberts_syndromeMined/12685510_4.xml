<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in UGT are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemias</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed the reactivities of some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38774">hydroxyquinoline</z:chebi> derivatives, which are naturally produced from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17362">quinoline</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyses were carried out using a microassay system for UGT activity in bovine liver microsomes in the range 0.5-100 pmol/assay with the highly sensitive radio-image analyser Fuji BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3-Hydroxylquinoline is a good substrate for glucuronidation, and the relative Kcat values were 3.1-fold higher than the values for p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5,6-Dihydroquinoline-5,6-trans-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23824">diol</z:chebi> gave a similar Km value to that of 3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38774">hydroxyquinoline</z:chebi>, but the Vmax value was approximately 1/15 of that of p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi> and showed weak reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26508">Quinoline N-oxide</z:chebi> gave a low Vmax value and showed marginal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Kcat values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48994">6-hydroxyquinoline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48993">5-hydroxyquinoline</z:chebi> were 2.1- and 1.2-fold higher than that of p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluoroquinoline (FQ) derivatives, such as 3FQ, 7.8diFQ and 6,7,8triFQ, did not show any substrate activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there are therapeutic problems in administration of some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17362">quinoline</z:chebi> drugs to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
