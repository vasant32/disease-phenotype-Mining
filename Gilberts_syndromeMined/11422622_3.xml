<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Low-grade fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is a common observation in healthy subjects (HS), whereas high-grade fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is believed to be a characteristic finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the role of mutation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>- glycosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) on fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of UGT1A1 and a caloric restriction test (400 kcal for 24 h) were performed in 56 healthy subjects (25 males, 31 females), and 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (18 males, 10 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 29 healthy subjects with no mutation in UGT1A1, and 27 healthy subjects and 26 Gilbert's syndrome patients with mutations in the coding and/or promoter (TATA box) regions of UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean increment of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (DeltaSB) was 7.6 micromol/L [corrected] (males) and 4.1 micromol/L (females) in subjects with no UGT1A1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with mutation in UGT1A1 showed higher levels of DeltaSB than individuals without mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among healthy subjects, gender difference in DeltaSB values was observed only in individuals with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> of UGT1A1, but not in those with mutations in this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that UGT1A1 mutation has a role in the development of high-grade fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> after caloric restriction </plain></SENT>
