<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of CD40 ligand and P-selectin in the mechanism of decreased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The soluble forms of CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and P-selectin (sP-selectin), and high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were investigated in subjects with GS (n=25) and compared to healthy controls (n=53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sCD40L and hs-CRP levels were significantly lower in GS compared to the controls (0.33+/-0.27 vs 0.71+/-0.37 ng/mL, p&lt;0.001 and 0.51+/-0.45 vs 1.16+/-1.31 mg/L, p=0.046, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both sCD40L and hs-CRP were negatively correlated with total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (r=-0.5, p&lt;0.001 and r=-0.34, p=0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>sP-selectin levels were lower in GS when compared to the controls but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the plasma levels of sCD40L, sP-selectin and hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These novel findings suggest that reduced sCD40L and hs-CRP concentrations may have a role in the mechanism of protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in GS </plain></SENT>
