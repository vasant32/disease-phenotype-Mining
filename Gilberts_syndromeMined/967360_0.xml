<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is the result of derepression of a gene that codes for a given enzyme; at the molecular level, derepression takes place when the substrate, by changing the tertiary structure of the repressor, brings about its detachment from DNA: in this way, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-polymerase is made capable of synthesising the corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inducing activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8069">phenobarbitone</z:chebi>, a drug employed classically in the management of Gilbertian forms, must be substantially attributed to an increase in the synthesis of microsomial proteins, as shown by studies with labelled amino acids </plain></SENT>
