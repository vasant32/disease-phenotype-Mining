<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rapid method was developed to detect this genetic polymorphism, using double gradient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DG-DGGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene was amplified with a 40-mer GC-clamp attached to the 5'-end of the reverse primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was then separated by DG-DGGE using denaturant concentrations of 15-25% and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> concentrations of 6-12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The (TA)6/(TA)6 homozygotes were clearly distinguished from both (TA)7/(TA)7 homozygotes and (TA)6/(TA)7 heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The (TA)7 allele frequency was consistent with that previously reported and <z:mp ids='MP_0005344'>elevated bilirubin levels</z:mp> correlated with the presence of the (TA)7 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DG-DGGE method described will make detection for this polymorphism fast, simple, nonradioactive and suitable for a clinical routine diagnostic laboratory, helping to establish the role of this polymorphism in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> due to multiple causes </plain></SENT>
