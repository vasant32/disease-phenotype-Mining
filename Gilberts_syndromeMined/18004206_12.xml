<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work compared the effects of (a) the individual UGT1A1 mutations on the glucuronidation kinetics <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17224">4-methylumbelliferone</z:chebi> (4MU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10319">1-naphthol</z:chebi> (1NP), and (b) the Y486 mutation, which occurs in the conserved carboxyl terminal domain of UGT1A enzymes, on 4MU, 1NP and naproxen glucuronidation by UGT1A3, UGT1A6 and UGT1A10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutant UGT1A cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and the encoded proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The glucuronidation kinetics of each substrate with each enzyme were characterized using specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1, in-vitro clearances for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, 4MU and 1NP glucuronidation by UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*27 were reduced by 34-74%, most commonly as a result of a reduction in Vmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of the decrease in the in-vitro clearances varied from substrate to substrate with each mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The glucuronidation activities of UGT1A1*7 and UGT1A1*62 were reduced by &gt;95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the Y486D mutation essentially abolished UGT1A6 and UGT1A10 activities, and resulted in 60-90% reductions in UGT1A3 in-vitro clearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The glucuronidation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UGT1A1 substrates is likely to be impaired in subjects carrying the UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*62 alleles, although the reduction in metabolic clearance might vary with the substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Y486D mutation appears to greatly reduce most, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, UGT1A activities </plain></SENT>
