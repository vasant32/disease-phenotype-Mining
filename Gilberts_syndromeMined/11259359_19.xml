<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amonafide, a substrate for the polymorphic NAT2, has an active metabolite, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-amonafide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> as a probe, slow and rapid acetylators of amonafide were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fast acetylators experienced greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> than did slow acetylators, and a reduced dose of amonafide for fast acetylators has been recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pharmacodynamic model based on acetylator phenotype, pretreatment white blood cell count, and gender has been proposed for dose individualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strategy adopted for amonafide is a model for future investigations in pharmacogenetics, although amonafide is no longer in clinical development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, is glucuronidated to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide by UGT1A1, the isoform catalyzing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is due to a homozygous TA insertion in the TATAA promoter of UGT1A1, leading to the mutated (TA)(7) allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan toxicity depends on the individual glucuronidation rate of SN-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased SN-38 glucuronidating activity has been found in livers obtained from individuals carrying the (TA)(7) allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A phenotyping procedure for UGT1A1 has not been identified and genotyping of the UGT1A1 promoter in patients receiving irinotecan may identify patients at increased risk of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial at the University of Chicago is ongoing to demonstrate the predictive significance of UGT1A1 genotyping for irinotecan pharmacodynamics </plain></SENT>
