<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old white man with concurrent diagnoses of large-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and GS was treated with standard doses of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No increase of end-organ toxicity was observed during four treatment cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The relative prevalence of GS coupled with the rising incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increases the probability that both disorders will be present in the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A MEDLINE search (1966 through July 1997) revealed little, and often conflicting, information pertaining to drug metabolism and disposition in GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, no information has been reported regarding the metabolic fate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is important to emphasize that the lack of enhanced extramedullary toxicity in this patient is not conclusive evidence that the hepatic abnormality of GS had no effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on information regarding mechanisms for hepatic clearance, dosage modification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> may not be necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> of GS </plain></SENT>
