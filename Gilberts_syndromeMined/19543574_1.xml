<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> inhibits osteoblastic proliferative activity in vitro, raising the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) patients are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare bone mineral density (BMD), serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), C-telopeptide (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) and osteocalcin levels in GS subjects versus matched controls in a cross-sectional, case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BMD determinations were obtained with central dual energy x-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum PTH, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> and osteocalcin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17 GS and 30 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant differences in BMD, PTH, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> or osteocalcin levels between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when older (older than 40 years of age) and younger (40 years of age and younger) cohorts were considered separately, the older GS cohort had significantly decreased total hip BMD, T scores and Z scores, and femoral neck BMD, T scores and Z scores (P&lt;0.005 for each parameter, respectively) compared with older control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum osteocalcin levels were lower in the older versus younger GS cohort (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation existed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects' serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and total body BMD determinations (r=-0.42; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, the association between serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and total body BMD was not significant (P=0.066), nor was serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> identified as a risk factor for low BMD when entered into multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present pilot study warrant further research involving larger numbers of subjects and longitudinal measurements to determine whether GS is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>decreased BMD</z:mp>, particularly in older GS subjects </plain></SENT>
