<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five children, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels decreased during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> treatment by 26% or more and the pigment composition in bile changed with a decrease in the proportion of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> from 33% +/- 12% to 13% +/- 1% and an increase in monoconjugates and diconjugates from 57% +/- 14% and 10% +/- 2%, respectively, to 72% +/- 4% and 16% +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four children, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels did not change significantly during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, bile pigments comprised 91% +/- 10% unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, 9% +/- 11% monoconjugates, and 1% +/- 1% diconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these differences, the former group can be classified as having type 2 Crigler-Najjar disease and the latter, type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bile pigment analysis in parents of patients with Crigler-Najjar disease showed an increased proportion of monoconjugates in at least one of the partners in three of four couples tested, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were about the same in type 1 and 2 patients and amounted to 236 +/- 62 mumol/L and 214 +/- 82 mumol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition the fractional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> excretion ratio, calculated as the ratio ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in bile]/[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in serum])/([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> in bile]/[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> in serum]) could not differentiate between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a 10-fold and 100-fold difference of this ratio between patients with Crigler-Najjar disease and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and between patients with Crigler-Najjar disease and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fractional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> excretion ratio proved an excellent tool to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and Crigler-Najjar disease, whereas Crigler-Najjar disease types 1 and 2 could be differentiated on the basis of bile pigment analysis </plain></SENT>
