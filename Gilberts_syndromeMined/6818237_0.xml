<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initially a simple anatomical curiosity discovered at operation or autopsy, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of the ball bladder has now, and despite its rarity, become of the greatest interest from a pathogenic, physiopathological and diagnostic standpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embryogenesis explains that this a developmental abnormality affecting the hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> which is probably of genetic origin, hence its frequent association with other malformations and the hereditary nature of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The usual finding of a syndrome of blockage of the sphincter of Oddi with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the common bile duct raises the problem of synergism between the sphincter of Oddi and the gall bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discovery of lithiasis of the hepatic and common bile ducts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of the gall bladder leads to discussion of the reality of organ lithiasis or the role of the distended wall of the common duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cholecystography and echotomography would appear to be the two techniques of investigation to be recommended preoperatively in order to increase support for the presumptive diagnosis once disorders affecting neighbouring structures have been eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The definite diagnosis is made peroperatively by manual exploration, peroperative cholangiography or even coeliac arteriography during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indication for surgery is based upon clinical symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This does not treat the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> but the associated lesions which are its complications, in particular: lithiasis the common duct, sphincter of Oddi block syndrome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the common duct </plain></SENT>
