<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have examined the variation in the promoter region in the gene encoding UGT-1, associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, in Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Blood DNA was obtained from 100 blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine the A(TA)nTAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the abnormal 7/7 genotype in Spanish population was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous 6/7 genotype was identified in 51% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the abnormal allele, similar in different caucasian populations, raise the question whether it would be worthwhile and cost-effective to introduce molecular screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in the study of mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, in the absence of haemolysis or evidence of hepatic injury </plain></SENT>
