<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> is a major component of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> so we investigated whether these variants predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> content and overall risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Loci that were identified in a meta-analysis to attain a genome-wide significance level of a P value less than 1.0×10(-7) (UGT1A1, SLCO1B1, LST-3TM12, SLCO1A2) were analyzed in 1018 individuals with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>Gallstone</z:mp> risk was analyzed in 2606 German choleystecomized individuals and 1121 controls and was replicated in 210 cases and 496 controls from South America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By using the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> as a phenotype, variants rs6742078 (UGT1A1; P = .003), rs4149056 (SLCO1B1; P = .003), and rs4149000 (SLCO1A2; P = .015) were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In regression analyses, only UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1 were independently retained in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 (rs6742078; P = .018) was associated with overall <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a sex-stratified analysis, only male carriers of rs6742078 had an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease (P = 2.1×10(-7); odds ratio(recessive), 2.34; P(women) = .47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sex-specific association of rs6742078 was confirmed in samples from South America (P(men) = .046; odds ratio(recessive), 2.19; P(women) = .96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> variant rs6742078 is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease in men; further studies are required regarding the sex-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Variants of ABCG8 and UGT1A1 are the 2 major risk factors for overall <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease, they contribute a population attributable risk of 21.2% among men </plain></SENT>
