<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is characterized by a functional promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 gene and represents a pharmacogenetic risk factor for irinotecan toxicity, but study data remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The active <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin is detoxified by several UGT1A proteins, which include UGT1A7 with a high specific activity that may contribute to the risk of irinotecan toxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping of the UGT1A1*28, UGT1A7 N129K/R131K, and UGT1A7-57T/G variants was done in 105 irinotecan-treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>; adverse events were documented during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 297 treatment cycles and analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, Mann-Whitney, and chi2 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of UGT1A7 but not UGT1A1 variants was associated with at least one adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three variants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> were significantly more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of adverse events was significantly higher (P = 0.0035) in carriers of the UGT1A risk alleles, who also had significantly higher rate of dose reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Irinotecan toxicity is more likely in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> carrying the UGT1A1*28 allele combined with reduced function UGT1A7 N129K/R131K and UGT1A7-57T/G SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the ability of UGT1A7 to metabolize and eliminate the active irinotecan metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, the UGT1A1/UGT1A7 SNP combination haplotype appears to be a superior risk predictor than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> alone </plain></SENT>
