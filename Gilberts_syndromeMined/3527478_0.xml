<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the results of a basic panel of laboratory tests, the system requests that specific secondary tests be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Input of these secondary findings can result in requests for tertiary testing, to complete the database necessary for interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> results is based upon final inferences from the collected findings through a series of rules, a hierarchical network that yields an efficient production system not easily obtained through conventional programming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rules included in this model are based upon initial results for total protein, calcium, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, alkaline phosphatase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, thyroxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, mean corpuscular volume, and the concentrations of four drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pertinent clinical history items included are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>, medications, and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Implementing this system in a laboratory-based accelerated testing program involving outpatients maximized the effective use of laboratory resources, eliminated useless testing, and provided the patient with low-cost laboratory information </plain></SENT>
