<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>N-acetylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi> hydroxylation phenotypes were determined in 54 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and in 247 (sulphamethazine) and 76 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi>) non-related healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty (74.1%) of the patients and 135 (54.7%) of the healthy volunteers were slow acetylators (chi 2 = 6.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients, the cumulative urinary excretion of sulphamethazine up to 6 h (Ae(0,6)) was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in the frequency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi> poor metabolizers were observed: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> 5/54 (9.3%), healthy volunteers 5/76 (6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metabolic ratios were similar in both groups as well as the urinary recoveries of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi> and its 4-hydroxy metabolite </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> seems to be related in some way to N-acetylation but not to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi> hydroxylation polymorphism </plain></SENT>
