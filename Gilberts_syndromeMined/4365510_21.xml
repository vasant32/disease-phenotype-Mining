<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A three to eightfold increase in the activity of this enzyme was found in four cirrhotic livers compared with the mean value of four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> livers and two biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated hydroxylase levels were found also in five patients with hepatic dysfunction but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (four alcoholics and one patient with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> associated with serum smooth muscle antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the hepatic level of collagen proline hydroxylase may be a useful quantitative index of fibroblastic activity in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
