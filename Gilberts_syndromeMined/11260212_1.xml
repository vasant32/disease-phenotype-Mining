<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency in two families with mutations in the same codon, but different base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of symptoms showed great variation, and five hemizygotes finally died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis was late and difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In family A, 1 patient also developed the signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In family B, the index case came to attention as OTC deficiency, after the transplantation of his liver when the recipient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In family A, the hemizygote males died at the ages of 12 and 18 years; in family B, they died at the ages of 20, 26, and 30 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by reduced OTC activity in liver specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The residual activity in autopsy liver of the index patient in family A was less than the activity in the biopsy of the transplanted liver of the index patient in family B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The molecular investigations showed mutations in exon 2 at codon 40 in the OTC gene in both families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, different bases were substituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In family A, the single-base mutation was a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> transition (Arg 40 Cys); in family B, it was a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> transition (Arg 40 His) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Published data on in vitro expression studies of the recurrent OTC mutation Arg 40 His have shown little effect on the protein structure of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies would fit well with our observation of higher OTC activity and later <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in family B </plain></SENT>
