<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>No accurate methods are available for specific determination of unconjugated and conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a novel approach, we now have developed such an assay which permits direct individual measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and its isomeric monoconjugates and diconjugates in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The monosugar and disugar conjugates are quantitatively converted to the corresponding <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>, which are readily extractable into <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These monomethyl and dimethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> are then separated by HPLC and detected spectrophotometrically in the effluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of an internal standard and calibration of the method with crystalline reference <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> permit direct measurement of the individual pigment fractions in the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The acuracy of this procedure was verified by a radioisotope dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In sera of 22 healthy adults and six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, only unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 42 serum samples of jaundiced patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e>, unconjugated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> fractions were increased, with the monoconjugates generally predominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and its carbohydrate conjugates, as determined by the new method, was considerably lower than the TB obtained with conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrariwise, both the new method and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> procedures gave comparable resuts when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum enriched with purified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16427">bilirubin glucuronides</z:chebi> was assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings thus indicate that unidentified, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi>-positive compounds distinct from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and its <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates are present in pathlogical serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reported asssay is expectd to serve as a reference method for measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and its carbohydrate conjugates in serum and to find general application in the study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
