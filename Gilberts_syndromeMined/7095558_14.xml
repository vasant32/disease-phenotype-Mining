<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique has recently been described by Blanckaert and his colleagues that specifically and accurately quantifies unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, diconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and the C-8 and C-12 isomers of monoconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique has now been used to determine the distribution pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and its <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates in 91 sera from 65 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e>, and the results were compared with two conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> assays yielded values for total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration that were markedly and unpredictably higher than those obtained by the new technique, and the direct-reacting fraction by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> assay showed little or no agreement with the fraction of total <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates determined by the new method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies using the new method had shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugates are undetectable in sera from healthy adults or individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, but they were found in 89 of the 91 present patient sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fraction of total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> represented by C-8 monoconjugates, C-12 monoconjugates, diconjugates, and total <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary obstruction</z:e> than in those with parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, but extensive overlap between groups prevented determination of these conjugated species from being diagnostically useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates in serum consisted of 30% C-8 monoconjugates, 37% C-12 monoconjugates, and 33% diconjugates, while urine contained predominantly diconjugates </plain></SENT>
