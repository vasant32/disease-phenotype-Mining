<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>I would like to comment on the article by Djouss&amp;#xe9; and colleagues, who showed low cardiovascular risk in hyperbilirubinemic men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data are interesting, in particular, with regard to the results of our study on the same topic presented at the 5th International Conference on Preventive Cardiology in May 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The design of our study was quite different; the study population included only subjects with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>) who had been followed prospectively for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our conclusions were similar in that the significantly decreased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> was observed in hyperbilirubinemic subjects compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size was not very large, and the length of follow-up was just 3 years, the differences between the incidence rates in hyperbilirubinemic patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population were prominent and reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the analysis of risk factors, we found an independent protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> on the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, which is consistent with data published recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated an increase in the total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, presumably due to high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels as proved in an in vitro experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete results of our study have just been accepted for publication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
