<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the bile from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a striking increase was found in the proportion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoconjugates (48.6+/-9.8% of total conjugates) relative to that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bile (27.2+/-7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This increase was even more pronounced in children with Crigler-Najjar disease, in whom, even in the most severe cases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> could always be demonstrated in the bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin-IXalpha</z:chebi> was unquestionably present in the bile of these children and amounted to 30-57% of their total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> pigments (&lt;1% in the controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to predict from the biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> composition whether a child would respond to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> therapy or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bile composition was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, except when there was associated deficiency of hepatic glucuronosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the observed alterations were not a simple consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that Crigler-Najjar disease represents a more pronounced expression than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> of a common biochemical defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase deficiency leads to decreased formation of diconjugates with an ensuing increase in the proportion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoconjugates in bile; in the most severe cases, an elevated content of biliary unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is also found </plain></SENT>
