<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven patients (group A) initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for CBR were unaltered by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition </plain></SENT>
