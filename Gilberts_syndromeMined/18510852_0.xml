<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical features and liver histological findings of 16 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 16 cases (13 males and 3 females, with an age range from 14 to 40 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and lipofuscin granules in the hepatocytes around the hepatic perivenular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic analysis of the two patients showed that the site of genetic mutations were located at exon 1 (Gly71Arg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert disease</z:e> can be improved by combining the data of clinical features, the genetic analysis findings and the histological changes of the livers of the patients </plain></SENT>
