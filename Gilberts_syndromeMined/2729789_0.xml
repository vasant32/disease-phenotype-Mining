<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made on the basis of a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in the presence of repeatedly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function test and absence of over signs of hyperhaemolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two test have been also proposed for the diagnosis of GS, namely the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> induced by a reduction in caloric intake, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> induced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study a reduction in caloric intake was associated with a greater absolute increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in parents and brothers of patients, showed high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in only one parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possibility of arriving at a definite diagnosis of GS is important both to the frequent presentation in adolescence with nonspecific symptoms that abdominal recurrent pain, the high incidence of the benign syndrome, and also to reassure the "patient" </plain></SENT>
