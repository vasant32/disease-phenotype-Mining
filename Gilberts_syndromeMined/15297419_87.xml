<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We wanted to assess polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT 1A1) gene: the TATA box polymorphism and UGT 1A1 G71R and Y486D mutations in the coding sequence, the main mutations characterizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, as predictors of severe toxic event occurrence after irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we set up a rapid, sensitive, and reliable technique in routine practice to detect before <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 treatment, the at-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy-five patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Pyrosequencing technology a real-time sequencing method, to detect the UGT 1A1 TATA box polymorphisms and mutations in the coding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were also assessed for both biochemical and clinical evaluation and tolerance to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No G71R and Y486D mutations were found in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequencies for UGT 1A1 TATA box polymorphisms were 41, 47, and 9% for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> 6/6, heterozygous 6/7, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> 7/7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tolerance to treatment decreased with increased number of TA repeat with 71% of the patients in 7/7 group who experienced grade 3/4 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The method we set up is suitable for the detection of UGT 1A1 polymorphism in routine practice before irinotecan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could help to detect the patients homozygous or heterozygous for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, at-risk of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> 11-induced toxicity, and thus could help to individualize the dose to optimize efficacy and limit toxicity </plain></SENT>
