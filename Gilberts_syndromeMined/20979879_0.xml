<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood sample were collected from the proband and his relatives by liver function test, etiological examination and genetic analysis to exclude other related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>-responsive enhancer module (PBREM), TATA box and common mutation sites in exons of UGT1A1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products screened by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>-3279T &gt; G in PBREM, TA insertion in TATA box and Gly71Arg were observed in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linkage disequilibrium is also noted between c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>-3279T &gt; G and TA insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four affected members, three are heterozygotes and one is homozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between genotype and phenotype with a high serum level of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>-3279T &gt; G in PBREM, TA insertion in TATA box and Gly71Arg are essential for the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in this Chinese family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in this family is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
