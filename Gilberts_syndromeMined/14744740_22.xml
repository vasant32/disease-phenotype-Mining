<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the UGT1A1 TATAA box polymorphism may play a role in the overall glucuronidation of BPD(-) in humans, we compared UGT1A1 TATAA box genotype with BPD(-) glucuronidating activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver microsomes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in BPD(-) glucuronidation activity (P &lt; 0.02) were observed in subjects with the UGT1A1(*28/*28) genotype compared with subjects having the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1(*1/*1) genotype in assays of liver microsomes that included 0.1 mM alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="50448">naphthylamine</z:chebi>, a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A9 and not UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar phenotype:genotype correlations were observed when we compared subjects with the UGT1A1(*28/*28) genotype with subjects having the UGT1A1(*1/*28) genotype </plain></SENT>
