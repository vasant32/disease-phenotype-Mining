<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in molecular genetics have frequently reported the concurrence of dual genetic polymorphisms in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi> glucuronosyl-transferases 1A6 and 1A1 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, leading to defective glucuronidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, as well as several other endogenous and exogenous substrates, such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> with severe persistent hyperserotoninaemia, mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo> syndrome, due to dual polymorphisms in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyl-transferases 1A1 and 1A6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with a long-acting somatostatin analogue (octreotide) for 8 months, resulting in a significant reduction in serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels and immediate relief of the symptomatology, followed by a long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of hyperserotoninaemia in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> may contribute, at least partly, to the nonspecific symptomatology commonly seen in these patients and should be promptly evaluated </plain></SENT>
