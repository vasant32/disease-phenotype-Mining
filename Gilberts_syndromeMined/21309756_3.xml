<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Variation of a short (TA)(n) repeat sequence (rs8175347) covering the TATA box of UGT1A1 (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase1A1) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) and adverse drug reactions, and is used for dosage advice for irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports indicate that the low-activity (risk) alleles ((TA)(7) and (TA)(8) )) are very frequent in Africans but the patterns of association with other variants in the UGT1A gene complex that may modulate these responses are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rs8175347 and two other clinically relevant UGT1A variants (rs11692021 and rs10929302) were assayed in 2616 people from Europe and Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-activity (TA)(n) alleles frequencies were highest in equatorial Africa, (TA)(7,) being the most common in Cameroon, Ghana, southern Sudan, and in Ethiopian Anuak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotypic diversity was also greatest in equatorial Africa, but in Ethiopia was very variable across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resequencing of the promoter of a sample subset revealed no novel variations, but rs34547608 and rs887829 were typed and shown to be tightly associated with (TA)(n)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results illustrate the need for investigation of the effect of UGT1A variants other than (TA)(n) on the risk of irinotecan toxicity, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> or human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi>, so that appropriate pharmacogenetic advice can be given </plain></SENT>
