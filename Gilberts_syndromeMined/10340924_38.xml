<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) is primarily responsible for the glucuronidation of SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of the anticancer agent irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1, also catalyzing the glucuronidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, has been shown to have reduced activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of an additional TA repeat [(TA)7TAA] in the TATA sequence of UGT1A1 has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between UGT1A1 phenotypic activity and UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phenotypic measurements included in vitro SN-38 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation in human liver microsomes (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recently developed genotyping test was used to determine TATA sequence polymorphisms in UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were assigned as follows: 7/7, homozygous for the (TA)7TAA allele; 6/6, homozygous for the (TA)6TAA allele; and 6/7, heterozygous with 1 of each allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine percent of screened liver samples were found to be homozygous for allele 7 (7/7), 43% were homozygous for allele 6 (6/6), and 48% were heterozygous (6/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of (TA)7TAA and (TA)6TAA alleles were 0.33 and 0.67, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant trend toward a decrease in SN-38 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation rates was found as the number of TA repeats increased (6/6 &gt; 6/7 &gt; 7/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glucuronidation rates of both substrates were significantly lower in the 7/7 and 6/7 groups compared with the 6/6 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a significant association of UGT1A1 phenotype and genotype based on in vitro phenotypic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of our finding remains to be established </plain></SENT>
