<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is frequent and severe in Japanese newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, it has been reported that half of the Japanese neonates with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> carried the 211G &gt; A (p.G71R) mutation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was reported that the -3263T &gt; G mutation in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> response enhancer module in UGT1A1 was associated with the majority of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene frequency of the -3263T &gt; G mutation was determined and the relation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in Japanese was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UGT1A1 in 119 neonates born at Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan, and 26 subjects who had undergone phototherapy due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> at four other hospitals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene frequency of -3263T &gt; G mutation in Japanese, Korean, Chinese and German healthy adult controls was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>Hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was assessed with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>Jaundice</z:hpo> Meter and UGT1A1 was analyzed by sequence determination or restriction enzyme method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The gene frequency of the -3263T &gt; G mutation was 0.26 in Japanese subjects and was similar to the prevalence in Korean, Chinese and German populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant increase in the gene frequency of the mutation in the neonates who required phototherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> compared to that in the neonates without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, neonates with or without the mutation did not show a significant change in the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and the mutation also did not show a synergic effect with the 211G &gt; A mutation on the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The -3263T &gt; G mutation is not likely to be associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
