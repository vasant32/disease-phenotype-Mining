<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletion or mutation of the UGT1A1 gene causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the functional promoter region for expression of UGT1A1 [Hepatology Research 9, 152-163 (1997)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of some drugs on the transient transfection assay of the luciferase reporter gene containing the 5'-promoter region -3174/+14 of UGT1A1 in HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among drugs investigated, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> was the most effective at the range of concentration of 10-100 microM, whereas stimulation by beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also could not find stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> of the endogenous main substrate for UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> was continued for 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The luciferase reporter gene containing the 5'-region of -97/+14 was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> but the gene of the 5'-region -53/+14 was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The region -97/-53 is essential for induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This region contains HNF1 element, therefore, we speculated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> directly and/or indirectly stimulates UGT1A1 expression through this HNF1 region in the promoter region of UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we clarified that UGT1A1 was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and the key position was the region (-97/-53) in UGT1A1 promoter </plain></SENT>
