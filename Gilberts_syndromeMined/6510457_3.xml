<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic parameters of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> (AP) were examined in 45 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects (18 heavy smokers, 5 mild smokers, and 22 nonsmokers) and in 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), amongst whom 2 mild and 1 heavy smokers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heavy smokers were defined as persons smoking more than 20 cigarettes/day and mild smokers as those smoking less than 10 cigarettes/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant differences (unpaired Student's t-test) in the elimination t1/2 of AP among the study groups and in its total plasma clearance (CL) were observed without any change in the apparent volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The individual CL values varied within the same study groups, but the mean +/- SD (0.026 +/- 0.004 l/h/kg) in the GS patients did not significantly differ from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonsmokers (0.025 +/- 0.006 l/h/kg) or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mild smokers (0.028 +/- 0.001 l/h/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the 3 patients with GS who smoked were excluded, the mean CL of the group (0.025 l/h/kg) was again comparable to that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonsmokers and mild smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) CL in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heavy smokers (0.040 +/- 0.012 l/h/kg) was significantly greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mild smokers (p less than 0.05), in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonsmokers (p less than 0.001) and in patients with GS (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that drug oxidation capacity estimated from the total plasma CL of AP appears unimpaired in GS </plain></SENT>
