<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is occasionally observed in liver transplant recipients with an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulate that these patients could have received a liver from a donor with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the UGT1A-gene TATAA-box in DNA from liver graft donors of jaundiced and non-jaundiced recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was obtained from stored donor lymphocytes and the number of TA elements in the TATAA-box of the UGT1A-gene promotor region was analyzed by polymerase chain-reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed two liver transplant recipients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They received liver grafts from donors who were homozygous for an abnormal A(TA)7TAA-box in the UGT1A-gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of 10 non-jaundiced recipients received livers from donors who were homozygous for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> A(TA)6TAA-box and six received livers from donors who were heterozygous with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> A(TA)6TAA-box on one allele and a prolonged A(TA)7TAA-box on the other allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that liver graft recipients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> may have received a liver from a donor with an abnormal TATAA-box in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT1A-gene promotor region </plain></SENT>
