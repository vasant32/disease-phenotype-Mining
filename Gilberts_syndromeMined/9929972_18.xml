<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> due to decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (B-UGT), and its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> has recently been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the Gly71Arg mutation of the B-UGT gene associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is prevalent in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese populations and was more frequently detected in neonates with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied 159 Japanese full-term neonates, evaluating the relationship between the B-UGT genotype and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, as assessed with a transcutaneous bilirubinometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene frequency of the Gly71Arg mutation in these neonates was 0.19, and neonates carrying the Gly71Arg mutation had significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003573'>increased bilirubin</z:hpo> levels on days 2-4, manifested in a gene dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Gly71Arg mutation was 0.47 in the neonates who required phototherapy (i.e., those with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>), significantly higher than 0.16 in the neonates who did not require the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gene frequency of the TA repeat promoter polymorphism, the (TA)7 mutation, was 0.07, and neonates carrying this mutation did not have an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the Gly71Arg mutation contributes to the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
