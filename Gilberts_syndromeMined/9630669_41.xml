<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of each mutation in the occurrence of the two syndromes, we made four mutant expression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative UGT1A1 activity of a single homozygous model of G71R was 32.2+/-1.6% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, that of a single homozygous model of Y486D was 7.6+/-0.5%, that of a double homozygous model of G71R and Y486D was 6.2+/-1.6% and that of a heterozygous model of G71R was 60.2+/-3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decreased activities of the single homozygous model of G71R and the double homozygous model were at an appropriate level to be diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and CN-II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of a single heterozygous model of G71R was somewhat high to develop to the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, suggesting the presence of additional factors for the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
