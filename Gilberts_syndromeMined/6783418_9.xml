<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of thirty-seven patients with increased haem catabolism has been studied to gain insight in their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugating capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyl transferase activity (GlcATa) in the liver and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoconjugates in bile were measured and the hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance was calculated from the radio-<z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>-survival data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present group, 41% of the patients clearly had a deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation similar to what is classically found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association may facilitate detection of these patients as serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were higher (65.8 microM +/- 19) (m +/- 1 SD) in the fifteen patients with associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> versus thirteen having only haemolysis (43.6 microM +/- 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fair correlation was found between the percentage of monoconjugates in bile and the GlcATa levels in the liver as well as with the calculated hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance, although some discrepancies exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using these determinations, a clearcut separation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values was not obtained, suggesting at least in the present group of patients that Gilbert' syndrome represents only one end of a continuum of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation rates and not a separate entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010374'>Pigment stones</z:mp> in the gall-bladder were documented in 51% of the patients and usually at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship towards sex, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, GlcATa in liver, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> or monoconjugates in bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age played some role as well as the type of haemolysis as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital dyserythropoiesis</z:e> (n = 4) or acquired haemolysis (n = 3) had lithiasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> was present, whereas an accumulation of iron and bile pigment was evident in the liver </plain></SENT>
