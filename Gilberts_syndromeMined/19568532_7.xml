<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 2,237 references, a total of 14 validated serum biomarkers have been identified between 1991 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine were not patented and five were patented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two alternatives to liver biopsy were the most evaluated FibroTest and Fibroscan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For FibroTest, there was a total of 38 different populations including 7,985 subjects with both FibroTest and biopsy (4,600 HCV, 1,580 HBV, 267 NAFLD, 524 ALD, and 1014 mixed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For Fibroscan, there was a total of 11 published studies including 2,260 subjects (1,466 HCV, 95 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002611'>cholestatic liver disease</z:hpo>, and 699 mixed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For FibroTest, the mean diagnostic value for the diagnosis of advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> assessed using standardized area under the ROC curves was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.83-0.86), without a significant difference between the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B, and alcoholic or non alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-risk profiles of false negative/false positive of FibroTest, mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, are present in 3% of the populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In case of discordance between biopsy and FibroTest, half of the failures can be due to biopsy; the prognostic value of FibroTest is at least similar to that of biopsy in HCV, HBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion this overview of evidence-based data suggests that biomarkers could be used as an alternative to liver biopsy for the first line assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> stage in the four most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e>, namely HCV, HBV, NAFLD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither biomarkers nor biopsy alone is sufficient for taking a definite decision in a given patient; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical and biological data must be taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence based data justifying biopsy as a first line estimate of <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Health authorities in some countries have already approved validated biomarkers as the first line procedure for the staging of <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
