<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our evaluation strategy was examined in living donors with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When donor candidates had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (&gt;1.5 mg/dl), but otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function tests, their genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed with GS when they had mutations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase 1 typical to GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donors and recipients were divided into two groups: GS donors and their recipients (n = 6, each) and non-GS donors and their recipients (n = 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> GS donors and their recipients had an unremarkable postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels of the recipients of GS donors were higher than those of recipients of non-GS donors </plain></SENT>
