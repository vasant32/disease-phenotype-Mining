<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-hemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, is caused by a reduction in the activity of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reduction has been shown to be due to a polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of seven <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (TA) repeats reduces the efficiency of transcription of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genetic background of a patient affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, we collected blood samples from family members for the analysis of the A(TA)nTAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of the A(TA)nTAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene was performed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimation of UGT1A1 promoter containing the variable (TA) repeats was performed by using a luciferase reporter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three different genotypes were identified due to the presence of (TA)6, (TA)7 and (TA)8 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The production of luciferase decreases in inverse relation to the number of repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The (TA)7 polymorphism, associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, is the only allele found up to now in white populations, while two other variants (TA)5 and (TA)8 have been identified in black populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We describe here the first case of a subject affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> who is heterozygous for the (TA)8 allele in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism, as well as the (TA)7 one, is associated with an increased level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and a significant reduction of transcription activity of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
