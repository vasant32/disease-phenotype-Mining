<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> as a rule becomes manifest in adolescence or in early adulthood; it may be transferred by the donor to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> in 46 OLT pediatric recipients who had a follow-up of 1 year or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria included unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>; its increase after reduced caloric intake plus prolonged fasting, without changes of the proportion of conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>; and high relative amounts of serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> IXa and prevalence of the monoglucuronide over the diglucuronide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 46 patients, 42 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only four otherwise healthy OLT recipients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conjugated fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver donors had been four men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>Hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> persisted with a fluctuating pattern for the whole follow-up after OLT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level in blood samples obtained after reduced caloric intake and prolonged fasting became notably higher than basal values, whereas the proportion of conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High relative amounts of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> IXa and prevalence of the monoglucuronide over the diglucuronide were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, DNA from liver donors' lymphocytes was available for one jaundiced and two nonjaundiced patients: tests for abnormalities in the promoter region of the gene for the enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase were in agreement with a diagnosis of GS in the former one, CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> may have an unusual early presentation in pediatric OLT recipients </plain></SENT>
