<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports show clear protection from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, proteins and other macromolecules from oxidation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> represents the most commonly accepted mechanism contributing to protection in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a recent meta-analysis estimated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> only accounts for âˆ¼34% of the cardioprotective effects within analysed studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To reveal the additional contributing variables we have explored circulating cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations, which appear to be decreased in hyperbilirubinemic individuals/animals, and are accompanied by lower body mass index in highly powered studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> could be responsible for the development of a lean and hypolipidemic state in GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we also discuss the possible contributing mechanisms that might reduce circulating cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations in individuals with syndromes affecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism/excretion, which we hope will stimulate future research in the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this article is the first review of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status in animal and human studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and explores possible mechanisms that could contribute to lowering circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters and further explain cardiovascular protection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
