<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the plasma disappearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg intravenously) were studied in 106 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and in 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had significant decreases in hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance and transfer rates from plasma to liver, resulting in increased values for plasma retention at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculated value for unconugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> production was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 40% of patients and increased in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 29 of the Gilbert's patients their bromosulphthalein kinetics were studied 1 week before the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and it was concluded that the hepatic clearance mechanisms for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and bromosulphthalein are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> transport maximum (Tm) was found to be low whereas the relative storage capacity (S) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8069">Phenobarbitone</z:chebi> treatment in four patients resulted in an increase in Tm, and S decreased in two patients and remained unchanged in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that there are several variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> tolerance test is a useful diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
