<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown an association of decreased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two segregation analyses in large pedigrees have suggested a major gene responsible for high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels occurring in about 12% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on a recessive model from a previous segregation analysis, we performed a genome scan using 587 markers genotyped in 862 individuals from 48 Utah pedigrees to detect loci linked to high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a complementary approach, non-parametric linkage (NPL) analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two methods identified four regions showing evidence for linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first region is on chromosome 2q34-37 with multipoint LOD and NPL scores of 3.01 and 3.22, respectively, for marker D2S1363 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region contains a previously described gene, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glycosyltransferase 1, which has been associated with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the promoter of this gene was recently shown to be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> which is associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other regions were found on chromosomes 9q21, 10q25-26, and 18q12 with maximum NPL scores of 2.39, 1.55, and 2.79, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated in these pedigrees the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-hundred and sixty-one male and 41 female subjects had already suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Male patients showed significantly lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations than age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association, however, was not observed in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that loci influencing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> variation exist on chromosomes 2q34-37, 9q21, 10q25-26, and 18q12 and confirms the association of low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in males </plain></SENT>
