<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patient was an 8-year-old Japanese girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the DNA analysis, she was homozygous for a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide position 1456 in the UGT1A1 gene, leading to the substitution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> for tyrosine at position 486 of the UGT1A1 enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because this mutation is located in an exon common to UGT1A genes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the UGT1A enzymes may be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 enzymes glucuronidate acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate acetaminophen tolerance in the patient, serum acetaminophen levels were determined after oral administration of acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum serum acetaminophen level reached (12.8 Âµg/mL) was far below the toxic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding suggested that the usual therapeutic dose of acetaminophen is safe for the GS patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of mutation analysis in UGT1A1 and acetaminophen loading test may be useful to avoid adverse effect in GS patients </plain></SENT>
