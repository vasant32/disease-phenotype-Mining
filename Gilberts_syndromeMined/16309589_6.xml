<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> on plasma levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which contribute to atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two AGEs, pentosidine and Nepsilon-carboxymethyl lysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), were determined in 23 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> (GS) and in 21 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pentosidine was assessed by HPLC and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> was determined with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used for multiple adjustments of possible modifying factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, significantly higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were found in GS subjects as compared to controls (28.9 +/- 9.6 vs 9.7 +/- 2.7 micromol/l, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serum levels of both AGEs were significantly lower in GS compared to normobilirubinemic controls (median; 25%-75% interquartile range (pentosidine: 1.12; 0.90-1.28 vs 1.31; 1.18-1.58 nmol/g protein, p&lt;0.005; and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>: 6.70; 6.10-7.34 vs 7.33; 6.76-8.20 micromol/g protein, p = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of both AGEs remained substantially lower even after adjustment for selected vascular risk and other modifying factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subjects with GS elevated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations are associated with lower levels of AGEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are in support of previous data on <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
