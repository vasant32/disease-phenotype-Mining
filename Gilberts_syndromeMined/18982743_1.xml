<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, statistically significant difference for total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration was emphasized between genotypes 6/6 and 7/7 (p &lt; 0.001) as well as 6/7 and 7/7 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations are significantly correlated with 7/7 genotype which is present in 9.8% of population studied </plain></SENT>
