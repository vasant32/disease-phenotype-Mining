<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis of the disorder is a 70% reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation catalyzed by the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which, in Caucasians, is the result of a homozygous TA insertion into the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (UGT1A1*28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homozygous carriers of UGT1A1*28 as well as those with additional UGT1A variants can suffer from severe irinotecan toxicity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> during treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37924">atazanavir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28 genotyping identifies patients at risk for drug toxicity and can increase drug safety by dose individualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid and facile UGT1A1*28 genotyping is therefore of great clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred ninety-one patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> were genotyped using the TaqMan 5'nuclease assay with minor groove binder-non fluorescent quench probes; results were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six patients (33%) were homozygous for UGT1A1*28, which was verified by direct sequencing of a different PCR product showing 100% concordance with the TaqMan PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel UGT1A1*28 genotyping method that employs allelic discrimination by TaqMan PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This assay provides a rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> genotyping, which is of value for pretreatment screening of potential irinotecan toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method utilizes a technological platform that is widely used in clinical practice and could therefore be easily adapted for routine clinical applications </plain></SENT>
