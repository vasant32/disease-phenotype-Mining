<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital Blood Bank over a span of five years, and includes 2734 donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the bags were screened for HIV, HBsAg, HCV and VDRL and the plasma in the pilot tubes of the blood bags was observed to detect any abnormality in color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 27 cases plasma was found to be icteric and liver function tests were carried out on these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two donors showed higher SGPT level, and were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant increases in liver enzymes were recorded in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Causes of icteric plasma in these apparently healthy donors are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and other hepatic causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, of which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> is most probable cause with a prevalence of 0.91% in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As there are no studies to document the safety of the recipients receiving such abnormal colored plasma as well as to document the hazards in its transfusion, the question arises whether to transfuse such units or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study highlights this dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A reassessment of existing policies and regulations is merited </plain></SENT>
