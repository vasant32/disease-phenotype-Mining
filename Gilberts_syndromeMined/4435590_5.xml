<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects of the study are liver biopsies from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, untreated subjects and patients being treated with various drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to rat hepatocytes, the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in man exceeds that of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and accounts for 76.3% of the total endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is to be taken into consideration in pharmacological or toxicological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, two components of the SER have been identified: more prominent is the type 1 or vesicular which has a regular honeycomb pattern, made up of cisternae with patent lumina and a mean width of 1500 A; the type 2, or non-vesicular, occurs in discrete foci of densely packed smooth membranes with a spacing of about 140 A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects under short-term treatment with Benzodiazepin (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>) the RER remained unchanged but the SER membranes were significantly increased with a remarkable, two-to threefold increase of the SER type 2 in three out of four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rise in incorporation of (14)C-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi>-precipitable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> as measured in liver biopsy material was also noted in these three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The suggestion is made that the SER 2 represents the newly formed membranes whereas the SER 1 would represent ;adult' membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in two patients under short-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> or Dilantin </plain></SENT>
