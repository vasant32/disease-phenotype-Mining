<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is a congenital, nonhemolytic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common genotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is the homozygous polymorphism, A(TA)7TAA, in the promoter of the gene for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), with a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence, which results in a decrease in UGT1A1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for this decrease in UGT1A1 activity, however, has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism underlying this deficiency in UGT1A1 activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The promoter activity assay using the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> A(TA)6TAA or the mutant A(TA)7TAA promoter and a luciferase reporter was performed in two different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The binding affinity for a nuclear protein complex or for TATA-binding protein was evaluated by a competitive electophoretic mobility shift assay using <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant TATA-box-like oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extract or TATA-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The formation of complexes between TATA-binding protein and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant oligonucleotide probes was also studied by a quantitive electophoretic mobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A TA insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence of the promoter activity of UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a decrease in nuclear protein complex binding affinity and TATA-binding protein binding affinity of the mutant TATA-box-like sequence A(TA)7TAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the mutants A(TA)5TAA and A(TA)8TAA were also compared, quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the TATA-binding protein binding affinity progressively decreased as the number of TA repeats in the TATA-box-like sequence increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TA insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence of the UGT1A1 promoter affected its binding affinity for TATA-binding protein, causing a decrease in its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This explains the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
