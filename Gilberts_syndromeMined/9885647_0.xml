<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to describe the spectrum of these liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> laboratory tests ordered during 10 months in an urban primary care clinic were retrospectively reviewed and the medical charts of patients with abnormal LFTs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 217/1088 (20%) of the tests at least 1 LFT abnormality was found in 156 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New diagnoses were made in 104 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main diagnostic groups were: non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> changes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and hepatotoxic drug injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 60 patients the physician classified the abnormality as negligible and not associated with significant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, an abnormal test that had been ordered for evaluation of a specific complaint, was indeed likely to represent significant disease (X2 = 29.5, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that finding abnormalities in liver function tests is common in the primary care clinic but does not often indicate significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
