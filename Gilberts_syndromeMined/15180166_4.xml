<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The metabolism of acetaminophen (<z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>) is thought to be altered in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of GS is a polymorphism in the promotor region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 gene (UGT1A1*28), its encoded enzyme being responsible for the glucuronidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and presumably acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased enzyme activity results in <z:mp ids='MP_0005344'>elevated bilirubin levels</z:mp> and may activate various metabolic pathways leading to higher amounts of potentially hepatotoxic acetaminophen metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with GS might be more susceptible to unexpected side effects while taking acetaminophen and other drugs which are substrates of UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a correlation between glucuronidation capacity with respect to acetaminophen, UGT1A1 promotor polymorphism and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> serum level were investigated in 23 healthy male volunteers selected for UGT1A1 genotype (6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtypes</z:mp>, 9 mutants and 8 heterozygotes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One gram acetaminophen was administered p.o. and urine was collected over 2 4-hour periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unchanged acetaminophen and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> metabolite were determined using HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metabolic ratios unchanged acetaminophen/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> in UGT1A1-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtypes</z:mp>, heterozygotes and mutants showed no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association between metabolic ratio and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level could not be detected in any of the urine collection periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that there is no correlation between the capacity to glucuronidate acetaminophen, the UGT1A1 genotype and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> serum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen is likely to be substrate of a UGT isoform other than the UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
