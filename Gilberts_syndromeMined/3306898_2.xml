<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A computer system for probabilistic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> was tested on a patient sample from a geographical area different from that for which it was first constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>144 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> seen in two Stockholm hospitals were interviewed and examined to record a total of 82 indicants from history, demographic details, physical findings and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with those of 319 jaundiced patients previously interviewed and examined at different London hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that disease incidences were different in the two patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were more patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> in the London data base whereas the Stockholm data base included significantly more patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indicant frequencies, standardised for disease incidence, differed with respect to age (Stockholm patients were on average six years older), time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of first symptom to hospital admission (Stockholm patients had on average a two-week shorter history of disease) and a number of symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e>, pale stools and dark urine which were more frequent among the London patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in hospital admission policy was regarded as an important reason for the differences in indicant frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of probabilistic diagnosis were poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 49% of the cases were correctly classified into twelve diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular the computer model was poor at separating different causes of malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0000610'>bile duct obstruction</z:mp> and at differentiating between malignant and benign <z:mp ids='MP_0000610'>bile duct obstruction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> were correctly classified and the computer model was 87% accurate in differentiating between medical and surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reclassification of the 144 patients on their own data showed the computer system to be well calibrated and 97% of the cases were correctly classified according to this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the computer system could not be directly transferred for use in a Swedish hospital but the results of reclassification were sufficiently encouraging to warrant prospective studies </plain></SENT>
