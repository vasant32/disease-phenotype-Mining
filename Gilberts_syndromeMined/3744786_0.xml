<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BSP clearance was significantly lower in the GS patients (1.28 +/- 0.37 dl/min) than in the healthy volunteers (1.98 +/- 0.45 dl/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference in clearance was not due to a significant difference in volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> could be divided into three groups according to their BSP disappearance curves: in 7 the curves were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; another 3 patients the disappearance rate of BSP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the beginning, but became abnormally low later on; and in the last 3 patients, an abnormal BSP disappearance rate was observed during the whole experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of these BSP disappearance curves indicated increased regurgitation of BSP from the liver to the blood in the second group and defective hepatic BSP uptake in the third group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="160246">aminopyrine</z:chebi> breath test also demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among the GS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the impaired BSP clearance and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="160246">aminopyrine</z:chebi> breath test </plain></SENT>
