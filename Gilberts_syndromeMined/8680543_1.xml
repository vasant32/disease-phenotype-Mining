<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We carried out a retrospective study of 71 patients with congenital non-hemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> who had been treated at our institution over the 25 years from 1965 to 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e>, 1 had new type <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, 21 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e>, and 28 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220991" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rotor's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed 20 patients with constitutional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) excretory defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study focused on the hepatic transport of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, bromsulfophthalein (BSP), and ICG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e>, a defect appeared in late-stage transport, while uptake and storage capacity were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220991" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rotor's syndrome</z:e>, defects were found in the early stage, and storage capacity was reduced, while excretion into bile was slightly suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A secondary rise in serum ICG was seen in 5 of the 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transport defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It could not be considered to be homogeneous, but it may exist at multiple sites, from the conjugation with serum proteins to excretion into bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> administration, the ICG secondary rise in the 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e> disappeared, and ICG was rapidly cleared from blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e>, BSP clearance in serum did not show any change before and after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ICG excretion in patients with constitutional ICG excretory defect was due only to the impairment o ICG transport, and the defect was suggested to be hepatic uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that studies of the hepatic transport of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, BSP, and ICG are useful for determining the etiological factors involved in congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and constitutional ICG excretory defect </plain></SENT>
