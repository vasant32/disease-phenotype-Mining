<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>10% of young male healthy volunteers have a total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> value over 20 mumol/l; thus such a value appears not relevant as screening cut off point in clinical pharmacology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was intended to confirm if a 27 mumol/l cut off point previously defined by the authors does not support a risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study dealt with 487 subjects who had together measurements of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> value and lab. tests of liver cytolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> during the selection process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>48 subjects (9.8%) had a total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> value over 20 mumol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation tests do not provide arguments of cytolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and there was no argument in favor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 48 hyperbilirubinemic subjects only 22 were included in clinical pharmacology studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In more than 60%, the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> value returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spontaneously and in no case appeared a significant clinical, biological, pharmacokinetic or dynamic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except a possible increase of slow acetylor frequency, the medical literature analysis does not show any relevant modification in metabolism, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics until a 40 mumol/l value of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 27 mumol/l value of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> previously proposed is confirmed as a useful limit that does not lead to an additional risk </plain></SENT>
