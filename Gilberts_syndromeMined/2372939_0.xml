<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the healthy subjects, 92.6% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was unconjugated (UCB), 6.2% was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucoronide (BMG), and 0.5% was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> diglucuronide (BDG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delta <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (B delta) was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients, the percentage of UCB was significantly higher and that of BMG was significantly lower than in the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of BDG tended to decrease in Gilbert's and type 2 Crigler-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Najjar syndromes</z:e>; the proportion of B delta tended to increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, except in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, B delta was frequently detected in serum which also contained BDG (mainly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disorders</z:e>) or which presented with high concentrations (above 100 mumol/L) of UCB (mainly in type 2 Crigler-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Najjar syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trace amounts of (Z,E)- and/or (E,Z)-UCB were detected in approximately one fourth of the serum samples analyzed </plain></SENT>
