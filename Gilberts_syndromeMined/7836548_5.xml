<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of fasting and feeding of a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet on the glucuronidation and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of lorazepam were examined in seven healthy men (age 18-30 years) and seven matched patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous intravenous/oral dosing regimen was used, with half of each group receiving treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> and cholestyramine (neo/chol) to block the EHC of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Feeding increased the clearance of free lorazepam from 10.96 +/- 0.56 (mean +/- SD) to 14.11 +/- 1.21 mL/min/kg (P = 0.05) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> when examined in the presence of neo/chol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clearances, on the other hand, decreased with feeding in control Gilbert's patients (7.61 +/- 0.54 versus 8.82 +/- 0.48 mL/min/kg), although the differences were not significant (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to both of these groups, feeding decreased lorazepam clearances (13.33 +/- 0.32 to 12.45 +/- 0.52 mL/min/kg, P = 0.17) in neo/chol-treated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and increased clearances (9.95 +/- 1.84 to 12.38 +/- 2.05 mL/min/kg, P = 0.04) in control <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lorazepam clearances were also 20-40% lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> when studied fasting and with neo/chol, or fed and in the control state (P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the glucuronidation and EHC of lorazepam is sensitive both to diet and to the presence or absence of the Gilbert's trait </plain></SENT>
