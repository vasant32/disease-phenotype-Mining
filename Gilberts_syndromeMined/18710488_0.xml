<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple diagnostic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), which avoids hospitalization and exposure to toxic test substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GS is the most frequent cause of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> test and the starving test are established approaches to diagnose GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these tests cause considerable side effects or require hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In single GS patients, we observed rapid serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> normalization after a standard European lunch (the "inverse starving test") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: At two consecutive days, 18 profoundly characterized GS patients (7 females, 11 males, median age 34.5 years, range 21-58 years) were investigated with the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> test and the inverse starving test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unconjugated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (UCB) levels were measured before and hourly up to four hours after lunch (median 645 kcal), and after the ingestion of 170 milligrams <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who consulted their physicians with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to undergo invasive diagnostic procedures than patients with an incidental finding of elevated UCB, despite UCB levels were indifferent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two hours after <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> ingestion, relative UCB exceeded 1.7 fold the fasting levels (median, range 0.9-2.4 fold, sensitivity 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the inverse starving test, UCB remained almost unchanged three hours after lunch (median 1.0; range: 0.8-1.2 fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis established the genotype of the TATAA box of the UGT1A1 gene; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients carried an UGT1A1 promotor polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inverse starving test is not an appropriate provocation test for patients with suspected GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 100% prevalence of the UGT1A1 polymorphism in our cohort underlines that the diagnosis of GS may be substantiated with this simple molecular test in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of GS </plain></SENT>
