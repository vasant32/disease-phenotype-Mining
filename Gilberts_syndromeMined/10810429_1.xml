<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">Anthracyclines</z:chebi> are the most active agents against <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, although their toxicity is often unpredictable; thus, there is a need for new active drugs with a safe toxicity profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The liposomal formulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> has low systemic toxicity and is taken up strongly by the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We started a phase I study with liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (starting dose 80 mg/m2 every 21 days) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and Child-Pugh stage A or B liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the starting dose, we recorded dose-limiting toxicities (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0008151'>prolonged prothrombin time</z:hpo>, 1 persisting grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>) in 3 out of 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, according to protocol, we went down to the dose level of 60 mg/m2 but still 2 out of 3 patients had unacceptable toxicity (1 hypertransaminasemia, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> with encephalopathia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we treated 4 more patients at the dose level of 40 mg/m2 and again we recorded liver toxicity in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall haematological toxicity was mild and significant non-haematologic toxicities, other than hepatic, were not recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile observed warns against further assessment of liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
