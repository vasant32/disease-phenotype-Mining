<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is recessively inherited, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> caused by decreased conjugation rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> associated mostly with homozygous A(TA) 7 TAA variant of the TATAA-box in the UGT1A1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish the molecular diagnosis in a 3-year-old male with atypical, intermittent, predominantly unconjugated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 99m Tc-HIDA cholescintigraphy was used for imaging the biliary tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of ABCC2/MRP2 protein in hepatocytes was investigated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 and ABCC2/MRP2 genes were sequenced from genomic DNA, and the mutations were verified by fragment analysis, sequencing the cloned exons, and restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cholescintigraphy revealed delayed visualization of the gallbladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A brown granular lipopigment differing from melanin-like pigment reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dubin-Johnson syndrome</z:e> was present in hepatocytes, but, otherwise, liver histology was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ABCC2/MRP2 protein was not detected on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, and 2 novel mutations were found in the ABCC2/MRP2 gene: a heterozygous in-frame insertion-deletion mutation 1256insCT/delAAACAGTGAACCTGATG in exon 10 inherited from the father and a heterozygous deletion 4292delCA in exon 30 inherited from the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patient was homozygous for -3279T&gt;G and A(TA) 7 TAA mutations in the UGT1A1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our patient represents a case of digenic mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>-a distinct type of constitutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> resulting from coinherited defects in ABCC2/MRP2 and UGT1A1 genes </plain></SENT>
