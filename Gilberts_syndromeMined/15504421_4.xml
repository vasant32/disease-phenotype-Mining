<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This study applied proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and vermis of the cerebellum of schizophrenic patients with GS (n=15) or without GS (n=15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, and healthy subjects (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hippocampus, schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-phosphocreatinine (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myoinositol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-phosphocreatinine (mI/Cr) ratios compared to healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients without GS, while schizophrenic patients without GS showed only a significant decrease of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the basal ganglia, schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of ml/Cr compared to schizophrenic patients without GS and healthy subjects, and schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> with GS is a more severe sub-type with regard to brain metabolism </plain></SENT>
