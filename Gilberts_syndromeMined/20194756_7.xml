<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known regarding those events that lead to UCB accumulation in brain tissue, and therefore, we sought to duplicate this condition in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human UGT1 locus, encoding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9-UGT1A genes including UGT1A1, was expressed in Ugt1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the most common clinical condition associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in adults is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, which is characterized by an allelic polymorphism in the UGT1A1 promoter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was monitored in humanized UGT1 mice that expressed either the Gilbert's UGT1A1*28 allele [Tg(UGT1(A1*28))Ugt1(-/-) mice] or the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> UGT1A1*1 allele [Tg(UGT1(A1*1))Ugt1(-/-) mice] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult Tg(UGT1(A1*28))Ugt1(-/-) mice expressed elevated levels of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (TB) compared with Tg(UGT1(A1*1))Ugt1(-/-) mice, confirming that the promoter polymorphism associated with the UGT1A1*28 allele contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, TB accumulated to near toxic levels during neonatal development, a finding that is independent of the Gilbert's UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas serum TB levels eventually returned to adult levels, TB clearance in neonatal mice was not associated with hepatic UGT1A1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In approximately 10% of the humanized UGT1 mice, peak TB levels culminated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UCB deposition in brain tissue and the ensuing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were associated with developmental milestones and can be prevented by enhancing regulation of the UGT1A1 gene in neonatal mice </plain></SENT>
