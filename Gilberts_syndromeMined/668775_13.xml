<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">Paracetamol</z:chebi> clearance was significantly less in the patients (255 ml/min SE +/- 23 ml/min) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (352 ml/min SE +/- 40 ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whilst <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> concentrations declined monoexponentially in the patients, the decline was biexponential in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference in the bioavailability of 500 mg <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> given orally was observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that not only is <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> elimination impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, but that its distribution kinetics are also abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both these findings could be attributed to a decrease in hepatic glucuronyl transferase activity </plain></SENT>
