<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was designed to investigate whether Zn salts might inhibit the enterohepatic cycling of UCB in subjects with Gilbert s syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with Gilbert s syndrome and 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers were included in this study according to the following criteria: fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, no <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, and free of any medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> o <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> form and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers were treated with 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">ZnSO4</z:chebi> in a single dose, where as patients treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form received 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">ZnSO4</z:chebi> in a single dose daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum UCB levels (mg/dL) decreased from 2.64 +/- 1.04 to 2.02 +/- 0.87 (p &lt; 0.001) and 1.8 +/- 0.36 to 1.48 +/- 0.32 (p &lt; 0.005) in subjects treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form respectively, but not in the control group </plain></SENT>
