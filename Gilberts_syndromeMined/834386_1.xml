<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The value of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> in the treatment of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000611'>icterus</z:mp> is demonstrated by a series of clinical experiments in which the drug was administered to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinaemia</z:e>, even at high levels, the situation being brought back to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within about two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage excreted with the urine in a conjugated form of various drugs proved higher in subjects treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> than in controls, thus proving that the drug acts as an enzymic inductor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover it is ineffective in patients genetically lacking in the capacity to synthesize glycuronyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The induction of this latter enzyme, however, does not exhaust the effects of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> for it has been shown that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> is capable of speeding up the disappearance of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> from the plasma in animals, of stimulating bile flow and increasing uptake of the pigment by the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in bile flow is of the order of 30% and takes place by way of a modification in the flow fraction independent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It would also appear that the drug is capable of increasing the activity of 7-alpha-hydroxylase, an enzyme that represents the rate limiting step in the synthesis of biliary salts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other drugs commonly used in the treatment of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000611'>icterus</z:mp> such as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> and uridindiphosphoglucose are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally the case of a female patient who from birth had presented persistent free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000611'>icterus</z:mp> of about 8 mg% is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 14 days treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> (100 mg X 2) blood levels of the pigment had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
