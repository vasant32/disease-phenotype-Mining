<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the molecular study in a cohort of 120 Portuguese patients with the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> and in one with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</z:e>, as well as a prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 120 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, 110 were homozygous for the [TA]7 allele ([TA]7/[TA]7), and one patient was a compound heterozygote for two different insertions ([TA]7/[TA]8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 9 patients were heterozygous for the TA insertion ([TA]6/[TA]7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional studies in these 9 patients revealed heterozygosity for the c.674T&gt;G, c.488_491dupACCT and c.923G&gt;A mutations, in 1, 1 and 4 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</z:e> was a compound heterozygote for [TA]7 and the c.923G&gt;A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The undocumented polymorphisms c.-1126C&gt;T and c.997-82T&gt;C were also detected in the course of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis in a family with a boy previously diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> type I and homozygosity for the c.923G&gt;A mutation revealed that the fetus was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the [TA] insertion was found to be the most frequent cause of GS in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of further mutations in the UGT1A1 gene was also seen to contribute significantly towards diagnosis </plain></SENT>
