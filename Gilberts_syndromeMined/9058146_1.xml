<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plasma sulfobromophthalein disappearance studies were carried out and 72 hours later, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations (total and unconjugated fraction) were determined at baseline and after 24 and 48 hours of dietary restriction to 400 calories/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fractional transfer rate of sulfobromophthalein from plasma to liver was significantly higher in types I (14.7 +/- 3.4 ml/min) and II (14.9 +/- 2.7 ml/min) than in type III (8.7 +/- 1.5 ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fraction of the plasma sulfobromophthalein pool irreversibly cleared per min was significantly higher in type I (12.2 +/- 2.6 ml/min) than in types II (9.5 +/- 1.5 ml/min) and III (9.3 +/- 3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly higher after fasting as compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the increments of serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels after the fasting test and the transfer rate of sulfobromophthalein from plasma to liver (F = 9.8411, r = -0.4535, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the presence of an active uptake system shared by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and sulfobromophthalein </plain></SENT>
