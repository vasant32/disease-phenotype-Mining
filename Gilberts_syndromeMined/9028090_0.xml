<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doubts have been raised, however, concerning the necessity for this test, since no abnormalities have ever been detected by it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, we noted a high level of ICG retention and a slight increase in indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in 3 patients, and further investigation led to a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> accompanied by constitutional impairment of ICG excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This syndrome can be associated with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> and those who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi>, or some other agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level increased briefly after surgery, no other abnormalities occurred in the 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since this syndrome is asymptomatic and is detected incidentally, the preoperative ICG test was considered to be useful </plain></SENT>
