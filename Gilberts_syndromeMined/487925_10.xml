<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies using the technique of percutaneous transhepatic catheterization of the splenic vein and coil planet centrifuge suggested that following intravenous injection of NA some of the circulating erythrocytes were rendered osmotically fragile and trapped by the spleen and that unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> increased in the splenic vein blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, the increments of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were closely correlated with the weights of the spleens removed for the management of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats, intravenous NA injection enhanced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase activities in the spleen, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>-5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>)-glucuronyltransferase activity in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is a result of complex reactions which include increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003657'>erythrocyte fragility</z:mp>, increased splenic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase activity, and increased formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in the spleen </plain></SENT>
