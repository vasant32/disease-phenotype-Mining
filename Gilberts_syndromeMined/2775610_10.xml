<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with those of a group of nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's Syndrome</z:e> mean oral clearance (CLpo) was 32% lower (P less than 0.01) and the plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) was 37% lower (P less than 0.02) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of unchanged lamotrigine excreted in the urine was 30% greater in the Gilbert's subjects (P less than 0.01) although this only amounted to 9.5% of the administered dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's Syndrome</z:e> have some impairment of lamotrigine elimination but this is unlikely to be clinically important </plain></SENT>
