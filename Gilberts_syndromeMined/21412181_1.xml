<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients during clinical development met laboratory, but not clinical, criteria for Hy's law with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> elevations suspected as a result of genetic variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> diphosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping of the two cases potentially meeting with Hy's law was performed using commercially available procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 single nucleotide polymorphism data were extracted from a genome-wide array database for 1187 patients from tocilizumab trials, and associations of UGT1A1 genotypes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> elevations were analyzed using logistic regression for associations with baseline and change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels as continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> elevations were not associated with clinical adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients potentially meeting Hy's law carry homozygous UGT1A1*28 alleles and UGT1A1*60 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28 and three additional single nucleotide polymorphisms showed odds ratios greater than 25 for associations with elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of rs6742078 accounted for 32% of the total variance in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (P=2.2Ã—10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> increases occurring with tocilizumab appear to be related to anti-inflammatory effects extending to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the absence of other signs of hepatic dysfunction, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> elevations after treatment with tocilizumab have a high probability of association with UGT1A1 polymorphism, which should alleviate concerns of serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results underscore the value of genotyping in the clinical trial setting to avoid misinterpretations that could lead to terminating development of a promising new agent </plain></SENT>
