<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Numerous mutations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) have been reported in patients with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 mutation appears to be considerably different among ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the incidence of this gene mutation in the Japanese population, the presence of UGT1A1 mutation was investigated in a group of Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> type 2 (CNS2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), as well as in healthy anicteric subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with CNS2, 63 patients with GS, and 71 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The promoter and coding regions of UGT1A1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA isolated from leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR products were directly sequenced by a dye terminating method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 enzyme activity was determined in COS7 cells transfected with wild or P364L (1091 C &gt; T) mutant DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygous Y486D was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with CNS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GS patients had UGT1A1 mutations with 13 different genotypes in the promoter and coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Homozygous TA insertion in the TATA box (TA7) of the promoter region (TA7/7; 33%), homozygous G71R (9%), and combination of TA7/6 and heterozygous G71R (17%) were the most frequent findings in GS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Homozygous or heterozygous Y486D (8%) and P229Q (8%) were also observed in GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation, heterozygous P364L, was also identified in a GS patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition to GS patients, homozygous or heterozygous TA7, G71R, and heterozygous Y486D were also observed in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of G71R and TA7 was 0.183 and 0.113 in healthy subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The P364L UGT1A1 enzyme activity was 64.4% lower than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in the coding region of UGT1A1 were commonly observed in Japanese patients with GS and in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> appears to be different between the Japanese and Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
