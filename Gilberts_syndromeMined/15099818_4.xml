<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphism (5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-TA units) has been identified within the promoter region of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 7-TA repeat allele has been associated with elevated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels that cause a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that promoter transcriptional activity of UGT1A1 is inversely related to the number of TA repeats, and that unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration increases directly with the number of TA repeat elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is a known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, we hypothesized that UGT1A1 repeats associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may be protective against oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of UGT1A1 genotype on somatic mutant frequency in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) gene in human lymphocytes and the glycophorin A (GPA) gene of red blood cells (both N0, NN mutants), and the frequency of lymphocyte micronuclei (both kinetochore (K)-positive or micronuclei K-negative) in 101 healthy smoking and nonsmoking individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As hypothesized, genotypes containing 7- and 8-TA displayed marginally lower GPA_NN mutant frequency relative to 5/5, 5/6, 6/6 genotypes ( [Formula: see text] ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our analysis showed that lower expressing UGT1A1 alleles (7- and 8-TA) were associated with modestly increased HPRT mutation frequency ( [Formula: see text] ), while the same low-expression genotypes were not significantly associated with micronuclei frequencies (K-positive or K-negative) when compared to high-expression genotypes (5- and 6-TA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found weak evidence that UGT1A1 genotypes containing 7- and 8-TA were associated with increased GPA_NÃ˜ mutant frequency relative to 5/5, 5/6, 6/6 genotypes ( [Formula: see text] ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that UGT1A1 genotype may modulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> of some types, in some cell lineages, by a mechanism not involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More detailed studies examining UGT1A1 promoter variation, oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> balance and genetic damage will be needed </plain></SENT>
