<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> who is also PM participated in an interaction study with propafenone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> along with five otherwise healthy PMs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Propafenone did not accumulate in the plasma of the index patient either before or during induction: AUC(0-infinity) of propafenone in the index patient was within the 95% confidence interval of controls; AUC(0-infinity) of propafenone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> and amount of urinary excretion of propafenone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> in the patient were within or even greater than the 95% confidence intervals of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> who also have a PM phenotype appear to be at no higher risk for toxicity of propafenone than otherwise healthy PMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An indirect conclusion from these in vivo data might be that propafenone is not a substrate of the UGT1A1 isoform </plain></SENT>
