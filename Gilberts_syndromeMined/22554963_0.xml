<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> characterised by mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> caused by mutations in UGT1A1 gene which lead to decreased activity of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent genetic defect is a homozygous TA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> insertion in the regulatory TATA box in the UGT1A1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 182 Polish healthy individuals and 256 patients with different types of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemias</z:hpo> were examined for the A(TA)(n)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR was performed using sense primer labelled by 6-Fam and capillary electrophoresis was carried out in an ABI 3730 DNA analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype in the control group was estimated at 18.13%, (TA)(6)/(TA)(7) at 45.05% and (TA)(6)/(TA)(6) at 36.26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in the (TA)(6)/(TA)(6) genotype distribution between healthy individuals and patients with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, uncommon genotypes, (TA)(5)/(TA)(6), (TA)(5)/(TA)(7) and (TA)(7)/(TA)(8) of the promoter polymorphism, were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genotyping of the UGT1A1 gene showed distinct distribution of the common A(TA)(n)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> polymorphism relative to other European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of a greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> due to hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo>, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> in this group of patients is very important </plain></SENT>
