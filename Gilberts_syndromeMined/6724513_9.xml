<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both Bolivian and Brazilian squirrel monkeys had higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations after an 18 hr fast than 4 hr after feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was progressive for at least 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both populations that received a semipurified diet containing 5% fat had lower fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations than did animals receiving 0.3% fat but much lower than those receiving 20% fat </plain></SENT>
