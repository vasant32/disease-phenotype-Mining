<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs in 2-7% of subjects in general population, and is manifested by mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> of benign nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted in order to analyse our experience related to the circumstances of disclosure, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and sex distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was based on the findings of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> in the absence of haemolysis and organic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, as well as significant increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> unconjugated fraction in serum after a 3-day hypocaloric diet (400 kcal/daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 58 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, there were 40 (68.97%) boys and 18 (31.03%) girls, indicating a 2.22 fold higher incidence of boys than girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age at diagnosis of the disorder was similar in boys and girls, and was 12.2-18 (X =14.71 +/- 1.55) years for boys and 10.5-16.4 (X = 14.38 +/- 2.10) years for girls (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for 3 girls aged below 12 years, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients the diagnosis was made after that age; in 20, between age 12 and 14 years and in 14, between age 14 and 16 years, while in 10 patents, it was made at age between 16 and 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 20 (34.48%) subjects, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> was disclosed on routine paediatric examination, in 19 (32.76%) when differentiating the cause of recurrent or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, in 17 (29.3%) during febrile condition and in 2 during insufficient caloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856724" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated bilirubinaemia</z:e>, both before a hypocaloric test and after a 3-day energy deprivation, were higher in boys than girls, but this difference was statistically significant only after the 3-day hypocaloric diet in age group between 16 and 18 years (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, no significant difference was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinaemia</z:e> level between the different age groups either in boys or girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to our findings, in children, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is manifested only in puberty, and 2.22 times more often in boys than girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is most frequently revealed during a routine paediatric examination, as well as when investigating the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher level of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in boys as related to girls is registered only after a hypocaloric diet in age group between 16 and 18 years </plain></SENT>
