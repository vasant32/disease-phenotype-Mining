<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study utilizes this information to identify the bases of deficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity encoded by the UGT1A gene for the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> isozyme, HUG-Br1, in 3 Crigler-Najjar type I individuals and the genotype of an at-risk unborn sibling of one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A homozygous and heterozygous two-base mutation (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> to CGT) created the HUG-Br1P387R mutant of the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> transferase in 2 different Crigler-Najjar type I patients, B.G. and G.D., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both parents of B.G. and his unborn sibling, J.G., were determined to be carriers of the P387R mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G.D. also contains the CAA to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> nonsense mutation (G1n357st) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Y.A. has a homozygous CT deletion in codons 40/41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HUG-Br1P387R mutant protein was totally inactive at the major pH optimum (6.4), but retained 26% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity at the minor pH optimum (7.6), which was 5.4% of the combined activities measured at the two pH values </plain></SENT>
