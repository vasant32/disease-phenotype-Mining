<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> often involves unnecessary testing and patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rifampin test can support the diagnosis; it has been described in short series and lacks standardization in dose, collection times, result presentation and interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to compare the response to oral rifampin in a series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>, 2 and 4 h after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> (elevated total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatopathy</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a basal blood collection, 900 mg rifampin were administered per os and new samples were drawn 2 and 4 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and esterified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were measured in every sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haptoglobin concentration was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When expressed as relative increase with respect to basal values, variations observed 2 h after rifampin intake were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> above 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation (r = 0.902; p = 0.000) was found between relative increases 2 and 4 h after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant variations were found in haptoglobin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rifampin test is useful in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>, but variations in total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations (basal and post-rifampin) make that no absolute cut-off value can be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correlation between 2- and 4-h relative increases suggests that a shortened version could simplify the test </plain></SENT>
