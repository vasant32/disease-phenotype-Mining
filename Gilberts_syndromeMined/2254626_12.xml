<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the clinical relevance of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> subfractionation by alkaline methanolysis and subsequent thin-layer chromatography (AM-TLC) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esterified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> could be detected and quantitated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serum samples investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of serum esterified to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was 10-28% in 60 healthy adults (mean 17 +/- 5% S.D.), 1-11% in 77 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (mean 6 +/- 2%), and 2 and 3%, respectively, in two patients with Crigler-Najjar disease type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001) and the overlap was restricted to three of 139 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of esterified to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was similar to that obtained with HPLC when corrected for with a blank run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absolute concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> in serum from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients was similar to that from healthy controls, but the unconjugated pigment was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> haemolysis (n = 9) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (n = 12), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> consisted of a proportional increase of both unconjugated and esterified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, the ratio of conjugated to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was not significantly different from control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> during the first (n = 18) and third ('remission') week of the disease (n = 15), liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (n = 34), and extrahepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> (n = 20) predominantly showed an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
