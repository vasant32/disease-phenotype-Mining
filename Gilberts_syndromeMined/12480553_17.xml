<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies were undertaken on the variability of three UGT enzyme activities in human livers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activities were associated with genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and UGT1A6 (UGT1A6*2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28 is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a deficiency in glucuronidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> leading to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, whereas UGT1A6*2 may result in low glucuronidation rates of several drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme activities and genetic polymorphisms were assessed in 39 human liver samples, and polymorphisms were also assessed in blood of 253 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Associations were found between UGT enzyme activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (B) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16836">4-nitrophenol</z:chebi> (NP; r=0.47, P=0.0024), B and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17224">4-methylumbelliferone</z:chebi> (MUB; r=0.54, P=0.0003), and NP and MUB (r=0.89, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the association between B-UGT enzyme activity and UGT1A1*28 (r=0.45, P=0.0034) as reported earlier, an association between B-UGT and UGT1A6*2 (r=0.43, P=0.007) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 253 Dutch Caucasian controls, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 was found (r=0.9, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, in addition to their reduced B-UGT enzyme activity, may have abnormalities in the glucuronidation of aspirin or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-derivatives, due to this combination of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 genotypes </plain></SENT>
