<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> and Gunn rats cannot form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16427">bilirubin glucuronides</z:chebi> owing to a lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because increased serum and tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels remain constant, an alternative excretory route has to substitute for this deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gunn rats excrete in bile only 2-13% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> eliminated in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the biliary excretion rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29026">urobilinogen</z:chebi> in Gunn and Wistar rats is comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sum of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29026">urobilinogen</z:chebi> excreted in the bile of Gunn rats amounts to 10-30% of pigments excreted in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this low biliary excretion, the intestinal content and fecal excretion of bile pigments in Gunn and Wistar rats were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support an extrabiliary entrance of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> into the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional proof for this was found in that the intestinal lumen of Gunn rats still contains a high amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29026">urobilinogen</z:chebi> after 3 d of external biliary drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar procedure in Wistar rats resulted in the complete disappearance of bile pigments from the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The direct transmural transport of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> from blood to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the intestinal lumen was demonstrated by injecting <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> i.v. into Gunn rats with isolated parts of small and large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Crigler-Najjar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients, the biliary excretion of bile pigments has previously been shown to be strongly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their stools, however, contained approximately the same amount of bile pigments as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although only traces of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were detected in the stool of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons (4 +/- 3% of total bile pigments), higher amounts were found in patients with Crigler-Najjar disease (20 +/- 12&amp;) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a direct intestinal permeation of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> both in man and rats </plain></SENT>
