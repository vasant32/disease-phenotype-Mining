<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase system (transferase) plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics of clearance of endogenous metabolites, therapeutic drugs, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> transferases are encoded by the same gene complex which we designate UGT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene arrangement indicates there are 6 exon 1s each with a promoter and each of which can predictably undergo differential splicing to the 4 common exons (2 through 5) to generate possibly 6 different <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire unique amino acid terminus of each isoform is encoded by an exon 1, and the common carboxyl terminus is encoded by the 4 common exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence supports the existence of other exon 1s upstream of the currently described locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 13-bp deletion in exon 2 represents the most common defect, to date, in the Crigler-Najjar, Type I individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different point mutations in the 4 common exons and in exon 1 of UGT1A, however, also account for defective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> transferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene arrangement, in conjunction with the toxicity data from the Gunn rat, leads to the prediction that detoxification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi>, and therapeutic drugs is linked to the UGT1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndromes</z:e> are uncommon, but the Gilbert individuals are commonly represented in 6% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is expected that, similar to the deleterious mutations in the common region of the UGT1 locus in Crigler-Najjar, Type I individuals, there is a range of moderate to intermediate deleterious mutations in this region of the gene of at least some Gilbert's individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linkages, therefore, at this locus could signal that these individuals are at risk for certain drug toxicities and/or idiosyncratic drug reactions </plain></SENT>
