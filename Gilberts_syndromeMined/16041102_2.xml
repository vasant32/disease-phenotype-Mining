<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) is the most common inherited disorder of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data show that the rifampin test can be used as a diagnostic test but there is controversy about its effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of administration of rifampin on serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level in patients with GS and in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum total and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were measured in 16 patients with GS and 15 healthy individuals before and after a single 600-mg oral dose of rifampin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with GS, mean (SD) serum total and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level increased from 2.15 (0.49) and 1.56 (0.41) mg/dL, respectively to 3.23 (0.72) (p&lt; 0.001) and 2.52 (0.71) mg/dL (p&lt; 0.001), respectively after rifampin administration, and in healthy subjects from 0.69 (0.13) and 0.34 (0.09) mg/dL, respectively to 1.68 (0.56) (p&lt; 0.001) and 0.84 (0.23) mg/dL (p&lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevation of these levels above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cut-off levels had poor accuracy for the diagnosis of GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, elevation of total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> after rifampin above 2.4 mg/dL was 93.8% sensitive and 93.3% specific for the diagnosis of GS, and elevation of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> above 1.3 mg/dL was 100% sensitive and 100% specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin elevates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level to above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in GS and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overnight rifampin test may be useful for the diagnosis of GS if cut-off levels for serum total and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level of more than 2.4 and 1.3 mg/dL are used </plain></SENT>
