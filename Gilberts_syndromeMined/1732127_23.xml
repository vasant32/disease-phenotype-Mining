<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> occurs in 5%-7% of the human population and is caused by an inherited deficiency in the glucuronidation of endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, resulting in its accumulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors of the present study have previously shown that rats with a similar deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation (Gunn rats) had reduced glucuronidation and enhanced susceptibility to the toxicity of the widely used <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi>, acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation, which prevents its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi>-catalysed bioactivation to a hepatotoxic reactive intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> had reduced glucuronidation and enhanced bioactivation of acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the biotransformation of acetaminophen, 20 mg/kg IV, was investigated in six subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, 41 +/- 6 mumol/L; mean +/- SE) and six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, 11 +/- 2 mumol/L; P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> conjugate measured by high-performance liquid chromatography was quantified by the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 2 hours for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> divided by the AUC for acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by the molar percentage of acetaminophen excreted in the urine during 24 hours as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-derived conjugates (cysteine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">mercapturic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">Acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> formation in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was 31% lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.27 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.03; P less than 0.05), and bioactivation was 1.7-fold higher (3.5% +/- 0.4% vs. 2.1% +/- 0.3%; P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One control subject with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation had substantially decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> formation (0.20) and enhanced bioactivation (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, glucuronidation correlated inversely with bioactivation (r = -0.84; P less than 0.001), indicating that a decrease in a major pathway of elimination can shunt more drug through the toxifying route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, a deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase, evidenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, can be paralleled by a deficiency in glucuronidation of other compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> can be a phenotypic determinant of enhanced acetaminophen bioactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, some people with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation may have a deficiency in the glucuronidation of acetaminophen; these people are not easily recognized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
