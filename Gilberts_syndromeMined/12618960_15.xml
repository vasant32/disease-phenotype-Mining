<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association is similar to that of smoking, systolic blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out a genomewide scan in a Framingham Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study sample consisted of 330 families with 1,394 sibling pairs, 681 cousin pairs, and 89 avuncular pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using variance-component methods, the heritability was estimated to be 49%+/-6%, and the genome scan demonstrated significant evidence of linkage of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> to chromosome 2q, with a LOD score of 3.8 at location 243 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak multipoint LOD score is located 1 cM away from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glycosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 catalyzes the conjugation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> and thus enhances <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> elimination; therefore, it is an important candidate gene for serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, a hyperbilirubinemic syndrome, has a population frequency of 2%-19% and is mainly due to a TA insertion at the promoter region of UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one other region in the genome produced a multipoint LOD score &gt;1 (LOD = 1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that UGT1A1 may be a major gene controlling serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in the population </plain></SENT>
