<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, an additional defect in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> transport might be required for phenotypic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and the early fractional hepatic uptake rate (BSP K(1)) of a low dose of tetrabromosulfophthalein (0.59 micromol/kg) were determined in (1) 15 unrelated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> plus 12 random controls; (2) 4 unrelated GS probands and 15 of their first-degree relatives; (3) 7 unrelated patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-Thalassemia minor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified by DNA sequencing of the promoter region of both UGT1A1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 1, GS homozygotes showed a highly significant negative linear correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and BSP K(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BSP K(1) values overlapped considerably between GS and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, whereas, in group 2, they were clustered within, and sharply segregated among, families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, despite elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels, had mean BSP K(1) values similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within each GS subgroup with defined UGT1A1 mutations, the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level is in part determined by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi> uptake rate, assessed by early plasma disappearance of low-dose BSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower BSP uptake in GS is not secondary to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, but probably caused by (an) independent, genetically determined defect(s) in hepatic transport mechanism(s), shared by BSP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, that are likely necessary for phenotypic expression of GS </plain></SENT>
