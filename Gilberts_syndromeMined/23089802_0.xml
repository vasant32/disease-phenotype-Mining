<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 also plays a critical role in the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous lipophilic compounds mainly in the liver and gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regulatory mechanism of human UGT1A1 expression is critical in treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and for effective drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified the distal enhancer module of the UGT1A1 gene and a single nucleotide polymorphism in it that significantly reduces the transcriptional activity associated with the manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review describes the transcriptional regulation of the human UGT1A1 gene by transcription factors and their co-factors, the genetic polymorphism associated with reduced transcriptional activity, and the induction of UGT1A1 expression by non-genetic factors including environmental factors and its pharmacological and toxicological meaning </plain></SENT>
