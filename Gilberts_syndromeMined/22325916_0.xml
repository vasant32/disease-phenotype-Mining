<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work investigated the effect of UGT1A1 variants on total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in Gilbert patients (n=45) and healthy controls (n=161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were determined using a colorimetric method; molecular analysis of exons 1-5 and two UGT1A1 promoter regions were performed by direct sequencing and automatic analysis of fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five in silico methods predicted the effect of new identified variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant different allelic distribution, in Gilbert patients and in controls, was found for two promoter polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients, 82.2% were homozygous and 17.8% heterozygous for the c.-41_-40dupTA allele; in control group, 9.9% were homozygous and 43.5% heterozygous for this promoter variant, while 46.6% (n=75) presented the [A(TA)6TAA] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the T&gt;G transition at c.-3279 promoter region, in patients, 86.7% were homozygous and 13.3% heterozygous; in control group, 33.5% were homozygous for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> allele, 44.1% were heterozygous and 22.4% homozygous for the mutated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of UGT1A1 coding region identified nine novel variants, five in patients and four in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis of these amino acids replacements predicted four of them as benign and three as damaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels are mainly determined by the TA duplication in the TATA-box promoter and by the c.-3279T&gt;G variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the UGT1A1 coding region seem to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003573'>increased bilirubin</z:hpo> levels, and, therefore, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
