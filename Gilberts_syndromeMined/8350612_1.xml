<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of them had familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) and ten had been considered as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was made using the following criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, no systemic symptoms, no overt or clinically recognizable haemolysis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of free fatty acids (FFA) showed a progressive significant increase after muscular exercise in both healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> subjects (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase was more evident in controls compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> subjects (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and fractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> showed no change in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a competitive mechanism between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and FFA is probably responsible for the lower increase in plasma FFA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
