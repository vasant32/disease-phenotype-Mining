<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have focused on the analysis of intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the common carotid artery in hyper- and normobilirubinemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed on 111 men without manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, complete biochemical tests were determined along with the examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> by carotid ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in hyperbilirubinemic subjects as compared with controls was substantially lower (p=0.017), and hyperbilirubinemic men also had very low age-adjusted prevalence odds ratios for having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> above the 50th percentiles of controls, even after adjustment for selected vascular risk factors (p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we demonstrate the inverse relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in healthy men </plain></SENT>
