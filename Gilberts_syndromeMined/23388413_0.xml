<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">Uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene family is involved in the detoxification of biomaterials and drugs in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the UGT gene family members, only UGT1A1 is involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, deficient UGT1A1 activity causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One disease that is characterized by reduced UGT1A1 activity is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two prevalent UGT1A1 polymorphisms responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> have been identified: G71R in exon 1 and A(TA)7TAA in the TATA box of the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, the G71R polymorphism has been associated with breastfeeding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in term infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> infants (VLBWIs) has never been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a female born at 28 weeks, 4 days gestation with a birth weight of 1172 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 21, intense yellowing of the skin and eyes was noted, and the patient's total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level was 23.7 mg/dL (her direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level was 2.1 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an exchange transfusion was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She had neither blood type incompatibility nor a family history of constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metabolic screens for amino and organic acids were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No elevation of any of the examined antibody titers was noted, and no evidence of an inflammatory reaction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The direct/indirect Coombs test, irregular antibody test and red blood cell antibody dissociation test were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative, and her thyroid function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We performed sequence analysis of the UGT1A1 gene after the patient's parents provided written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Exon 1 of the UGT1 gene on chromosome 2 was analyzed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous substitution from G to A (211G[rightwards arrow]A: G71R) in base 211 was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We speculated that this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infant</z:e> with carrying the G71R polymorphism reduced UGT1A1 activity and developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> that was likely triggered by factors such as breast feeding and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism appears at some frequency among VLBWIs, which would necessitate adequate care of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> even after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
