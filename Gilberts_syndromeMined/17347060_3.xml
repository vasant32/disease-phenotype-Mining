<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: To clarify the precise <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, an unconjugated familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, where impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation is caused by reduced UGT1A1 activity determined by a defective function of the A(TA)6TAA promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were measured in a large, homogeneous resident population from North-Eastern Italy, consisting of 1.639 males (age 44.5+/-13.9, range 18-89 years), and 1.420 females (age 45.1+/-15.0, range 18-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 112 nuclear families from hyperbilirubinemic probands living in the same area a complex segregation analysis was then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both samples we carefully excluded potentially confounding factors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, excessive cigarette smoking, drug consumption, overt haemolysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations are higher in males than in females, showing fluctuations through the different age periods in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complex segregation results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> exhibits a precise <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in which a major recessive gene with a frequency of 0.45 is responsible for higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This major recessive gene accounts only for a part of the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration, thus implying additional, environmental factors for the clinical appearance of GS </plain></SENT>
