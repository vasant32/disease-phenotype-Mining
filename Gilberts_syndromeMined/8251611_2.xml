<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about their alterations in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have studied the relationship between the enzyme activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (RB) binding in hepatic cytosol and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) kinetics in patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enzyme activity was measured in samples of hepatic cytosol obtained from 52 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the content of cationic and neutral transferases was estimated in 17 biopsy samples by densitometry of Coomassie blue stained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoretograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RB binding studies also were performed on cytosol samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICG kinetic parameters were determined using the two-compartment open model in 17 patients who were given the dye (0.5 mg kg-1) intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the enzyme activity and liver function tests, content of the enzyme, RB binding and ICG kinetic parameters were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1) The enzyme activities were high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) The enzyme activities were positively correlated with serum cholinesterase activity, serum albumin level and hepaplastin test, and negatively correlated with ICG retention rate at 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) The enzyme activity, its content and RB binding affinity of the cytosol were positively correlated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(4) The enzyme activity was positively correlated with hepatic ICG distribution volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the role of the GSH S-transferases as ligandins in intracellular storage of dyes </plain></SENT>
