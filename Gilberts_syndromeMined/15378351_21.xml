<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutation, A(TA)7TAA, is thought to be the sole cause of the syndrome in Caucasians, but an enhancer polymorphism (T-3279G) that lowers transcriptional activity has recently been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have tested the linkage of the two mutations in 11 Caucasians and 12 Japanese patients who were homozygous for A(TA)7TAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 23 patients were also homozygous for T-3279G, indicating that T-3279G and A(TA)7TAA were linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in transcription caused by both mutations together may be essential to the syndrome </plain></SENT>
