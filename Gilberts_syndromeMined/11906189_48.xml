<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a polymorphism that results in a T to G substitution at nucleotide number -3263 of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>-responsive enhancer module of the UGT1A1 gene, thereby significantly decreasing transcriptional activity as indicated by the luciferase-reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least one T-3263G allele was found in 21 of 25 subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>); this frequency (0.58) was significantly higher than that in normobilirubinemic controls (0.17; n = 8 of 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygous mutations in the TATA element (A[TA](7)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) or at nucleotide 211 of exon 1 (G to A substitution) were found in 5 and 2 of the hyperbilirubinemic group, respectively, while 12 of these subjects were double heterozygotes for the T-3263G and G211A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in these double heterozygotes were significantly higher than those in control subjects carrying one or other of these mutations singly, indicating that compound heterozygous mutations may result in more strongly reduced UGT1A1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that homozygosity and compound heterozygosity for mutations in the UGT1A1 gene promoter (T-3263G and A[TA](7)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) and/or exon 1 of the gene (G211A) could explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> seen in the majority of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
