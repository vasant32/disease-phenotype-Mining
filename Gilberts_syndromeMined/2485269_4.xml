<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma disappearance rate and the increment in plasma unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> after intravenous administration of 5.9 mumol of rifamycin SV (RSV)/kg body wt. were investigated in 51 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and 35 control subjects of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the plasma disappearance rate and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> after RSV administration were higher (P &lt; 0.001) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and with the syndrome, showed a significantly shorter t1/2 and a lower hyperbilirubinaemic response as compared with males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear correlation (P &lt; 0.001) was present between RSV plasma half-life and the hyperbilirubinaemic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, RSV was shown to inhibit sulphobromophthalein (BSP) uptake in rat liver plasma-membrane vesicles with a Ki of 20 mumol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence that this effect was due to competition for bilitranslocase was sought on preparations of the purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under these experimental conditions, RSV inhibited BSP binding with a Ki of 17 mumol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since RSV competes with BSP for binding to bilitranslocase in vitro, the data are interpreted as suggesting that reduced bilitranslocase function might underlie the delayed RSV plasma clearance and the exacerbated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
