<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of the biochemical defects underlying the hepatic forms of congenital, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias</z:hpo> has been greatly enhanced over the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is mostly due to the availability of pure, labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, the appropriate kinetic analyses, and a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it is quite obvious that the defect underlying Gilbert's and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndromes</z:e> is deficient glucuronidation, the molecular explanation may eventually be found in altered composition of the microsomal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> rather than in a protein defect of glucuronyl transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recognition that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is a quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity will allow a better understanding of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of this disorder; its relationship to Crigler-Najjar type II disease also awaits further definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that definition of the molecular defect in Crigler-Najjar type I will lead to better therapeutic modalities, but this remains to be seen </plain></SENT>
