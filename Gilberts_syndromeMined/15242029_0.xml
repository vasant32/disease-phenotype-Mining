<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify moderate liver impairment in a group of hyperbilirubinaemic adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using gas chromatography we assessed both total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> levels in 50 adolescents with juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time we performed hepatologic examinations and subsequent follow-up assessment of these patients for a period of at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a control group we examined 30 adolescents without any impairment of both the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and 18 patients with low grade (moderately) active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups we assessed total and primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> levels as well as conventional liver tests (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, ALT, AST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the clinical course and laboratory findings we divided our patients with juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> into two groups: a group of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (30 patients) and a group of individuals with probable moderate liver impairment (20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter group consisted of the adolescents who exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinaemia</z:e> over 90 micromol/l and/or exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> proved by the ultrasound examination and/or exhibited intermittent elevation of the liver aminotransferases serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of individuals with moderate liver impairment serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated in 26% of patients, and the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> level was significantly elevated in 25% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two parameters mutually correlated at a high level of significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> is one of the common conditions of adolescent age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is diverse; it includes both benign conditions like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and post-hepatitic and toxic conditions that require a long-term regimen and follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of people suffering from juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> has been growing in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Currently 4-6% of the adolescent population suffers from this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This growing number is probably caused by external factors of our environment (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, toxic effects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The determination of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in hyperbilirubinaemic patients and the provision of an adequate regimen of exercise and adequate nutritional measures is of great importance for the health of the adolescent population </plain></SENT>
