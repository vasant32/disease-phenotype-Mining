<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with a homozygous polymorphism, A(TA)7TAA instead of A(TA)6TAA, in the TATA-box of the promoter region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the correlation between this promoter region polymorphism and in vitro human liver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase enzyme activity was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Liver samples from organ transplant donors n=39) and two known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients were used for measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase enzyme activity and for isolation of DNA followed by detection of the promoter region polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were assigned as follows; 6/6: homozygous for the A(TA)6TAA-allele, 7/7: homozygous for the A(TA)7TAA-allele, and 6/7: heterozygous with one of each alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen out of 39 subjects (44%) had the homozygous 6/6 genotype, 18 subjects (46%) had the heterozygous 6/7 genotype, whereas four individuals (10%) and the two individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> had the 7/7 genotype correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an allele frequency of 0.33 for the A(TA)7TAA-allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase enzyme activity of the 17 subjects with the 6/6 genotype (1565 nmol/g liver/h) was significantly higher than the activity of the 18 subjects with the 6/7 genotype (985 nmol/g liver/h; p&lt;0.05) and the six individuals with the 7/7 genotype (749 nmol/g liver/h; p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in enzyme activity were found between the 6/7 and the 7/7 genotype groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a close association between the promoter region genotype and the expression of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects who have a 7/7 genotype have the lowest enzyme activity, whereas subjects with the heterozygous 6/7 genotype have an intermediate enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
