<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is an important endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may protect against IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is the only enzyme involved in the conjugation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and the common UGT1A1*28 allele in the UGT1A1 gene, which is strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in Caucasians, results in elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To test the hypothesis that the UGT1A1*28 allele is associated with lower disease susceptibility to, and disease behavior within, IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a possible altered risk for developing IBD-drug related side-effects was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Genomic DNA of 751 patients with IBD (209 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 542 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) and 930 healthy controls was genotyped for the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and genotype distribution was compared between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotype phenotype interactions were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> significantly less often bear the UGT1A1*28 homozygous genotype compared to the control group, with an odds ratio of 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group showed no significant differences compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The homozygous state of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, associated with higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels, may be protective for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, suggesting that the anti-oxidant capacity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may play a part </plain></SENT>
