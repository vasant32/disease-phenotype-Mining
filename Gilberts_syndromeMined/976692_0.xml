<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of serum proteins in pathogenesis of these cases, ICG-binding patterns of serum proteins of the patients were compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons by the method of Sephadex G200 column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No qualitative differences in binding patterns were observed between serum proteins of the patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these results, serum proteins were thought to be minor determinants of the hepatic ICG uptake mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma BSP clearance in these patients, the contents of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi>-binding proteins, Y and Z, were thought to be sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible qualitative abnormalities of the Y and/or Z proteins were also discussed </plain></SENT>
