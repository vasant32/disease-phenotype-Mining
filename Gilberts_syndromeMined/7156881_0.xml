<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cholic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> were determined by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients there was a pronounced increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (mean increase, 140%) after caloric restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, both fasting and postprandial levels of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range before and after reduced caloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the hepatic uptake and secretion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results show that determinations of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> can be used to assess liver function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> irrespective of the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
