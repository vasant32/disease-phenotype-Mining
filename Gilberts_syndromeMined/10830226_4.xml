<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in liver transplant recipients was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> acquired through the liver allograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 305 patients followed in our Liver Transplant Clinic, five patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo>, and biliary tract pathology were identified; 10 other post-orthotopic liver transplantion patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver chemistry tests were randomly selected as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded liver allograft tissue and peripheral lymphocytes and was genotyped for the TA repeat at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucononosyltransferase-lA1 promoter region by polymerase chain reaction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the (TA)7 allele was considered diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level of the study patients was 2.28 mg/dl (range 1.8-3.0), consisting predominantly of the unconjugated form; that of the control patients was 0.76 mg/dl (range 0.4-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The liver tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients in the study group possessed the homozygous A(TA)7TAA genotype that was not observed in their lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the liver tissue from the control patients demonstrated homozygosity for the A(TA)7TAA allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">Uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 deficiency, causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, may be carried by the donor liver and present with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in liver transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
