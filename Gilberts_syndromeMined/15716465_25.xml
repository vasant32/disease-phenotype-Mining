<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28 is a functional UGT promoter polymorphism associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> and severe irinotecan toxicity, which also occurs in the absence of UGT1A1*28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify and characterize UGT promoter variants relevant for irinotecan detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant UGT1A proteins were analyzed for irinotecan metabolite glucuronidation by UGT activity assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 427 healthy blood donors and 71 homozygous UGT1A1*28 carriers, the 5'-untranslated region of the UGT1A7 gene locus was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An SNP was detected by allelic discrimination and characterized by reporter gene experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel -57 T--&gt; G SNP with a gene frequency of 0.39 in healthy blood donors was identified in the putative TATA box of the UGT1A7 gene, reducing promoter activity to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is in linkage dysequilibrium with a variant of the UGT1A7 first exon that is present in the reduced-activity UGT1A7*3 and UGT1A7*4 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homozygous UGT1A1*28 carriers simultaneously carried this variant in 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel reduced-function TATA box SNP of the UGT1A7 gene that catalyzes irinotecan metabolite detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its association with variants of the UGT1A1 promoter and UGT1A7 gene may influence irinotecan metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our finding emphasizes the importance of combinations of structural and regulatory gene polymorphisms that may be useful as markers of drug toxicity </plain></SENT>
