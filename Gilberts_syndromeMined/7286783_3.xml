<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximal increment of unconjugated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, the retention at four hours, and the area under the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration time curve </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations (less than 17.1 mumol/l = 1 mg%) at the time of the study, but abnormal AUC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> increment </plain></SENT>
