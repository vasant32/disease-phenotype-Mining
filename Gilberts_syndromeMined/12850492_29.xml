<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As well as its relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, homozygosity for the extended sequence, (TA)(7) (TA)(7), has been found to be an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> E-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> and other intermediate forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta thalassemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the importance of this polymorphism in these common disorders a wide-scale population study of the relative frequency of the size alleles of the UGT1A1 promoter has been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the (TA)(7) allele occurs in 10-25% of the populations of Africa and the Indian subcontinent, with a variable frequency in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It occurs at a much lower frequency in Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and the Pacific Islands, ranging from 0 to 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>African populations show a much greater diversity of length alleles than other populations </plain></SENT>
