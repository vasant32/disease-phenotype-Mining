<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>Prolonged neonatal jaundice</z:hpo>, beyond day 14 of life, is very common and of concern to the clinician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether a genetic mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT1A1 gene, which has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in adults, is a contributory factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>prolonged neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Blood was collected from 85 term newborns with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and DNA was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neonates were divided into 6 groups depending on whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed and whether they had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, prolonged, or very prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 TATA promoter genotyping (DNA test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, and analysis of the entire UGT1A1 coding sequence was performed in a representative sample (11 of 26) of very prolonged cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to the known common UGT1A1 TATA alleles (TA6 and TA7), a novel TATA allele (TA5) in a neonate with very prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of the TATA genotype distributions within the group of breast-fed neonates revealed significant differences among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, prolonged, and very prolonged subgroups (.05 &gt; P &gt;.01): the incidence of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> genotypes (7/7 and 5/7) is 5 times greater in very prolonged cases (31%) relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neonates with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> from family pedigrees were observed to demonstrate the Gilbert's phenotype as children or young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to develop prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in breast-fed infants is associated with TATA box polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene and will be recognized as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
