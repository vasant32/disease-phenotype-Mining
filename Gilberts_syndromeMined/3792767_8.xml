<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> conjugates were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serum samples tested and were identified as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> 1-O-acyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the concentration of unconjugated pigment was increased, the fraction of conjugated relative to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> was markedly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with Crigler-Najjar disease differed from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> by the higher unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and the undetectability of diconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A striking finding was that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disease</z:e>, the concentration of both monoconjugates and diconjugates was enhanced in parallel with the increase of unconjugated pigment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the fraction of conjugated relative to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> remained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, heterozygote R/APfd-j/+ rats with impaired hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation exhibit an increased unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level in serum, whereas the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In serum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats loaded intraperitoneally with unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, both unconjugated and mono- and diconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> were increased in parallel so that the ratio of unconjugated to esterified pigment remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased hepatic conjugation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003573'>increased bilirubin</z:hpo> load was associated with a lower percentage of diconjugates relative to total conjugates both in human and rat serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results are consistent with a compartmental model in which there is bidirectional transfer across the sinusoidal membrane for unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> as well as for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16427">bilirubin glucuronides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because typical patterns of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> are found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and patients with hemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, determination of esterified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> in serum is of value to study the pathophysiology and the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
