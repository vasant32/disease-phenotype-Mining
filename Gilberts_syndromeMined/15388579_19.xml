<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in the promoter of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) underlies <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and appears to be a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between UGT1A1 (TA)(n) genotype, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in a sample of Jamaicans with SS disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were from the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study (cohort sample, n = 209) and the Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica (clinic sample, n = 357) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 (TA)(n) promoter region was sequenced in 541 SS disease subjects and 111 healthy controls (control sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels for (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) and (TA)(7)/(TA)(8) genotypes were elevated compared with (TA)(6)/(TA)(6) (clinic sample, P &lt; 10(-5); cohort sample, P &lt; 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype was also associated with symptomatic presentation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in the clinic sample (odds ratio [OR] = 11.3; P = 7.0 x 10(-4)) but not in the younger cohort sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These unexpected findings indicate that the temporal evolution of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> may involve factors other than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although further studies of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in SS disease are required, the (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype may be a risk factor for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in older people with SS disease </plain></SENT>
