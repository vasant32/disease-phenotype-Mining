<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels was observed in 12% of patients upon administration of tranilast in a phase III clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the potential genetic factors that may account for the drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, we examined polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene in over a thousand patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that the TA repeat polymorphism in UGT1A1, which predisposes some individuals to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, predicted the susceptibility to tranilast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype was present in 39% of the 127 hyperbilirubinemic patients vs 7% of the 909 controls (P=2 x 10(-22)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rapid identification of genetic factors accounting for the observed adverse effect during the course of a double-blind clinical trial demonstrated the potential application of pharmacogenetics in the clinical development of safe and effective medicines </plain></SENT>
