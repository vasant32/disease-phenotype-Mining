<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of genetic risk factors have been implicated in the development of neonatal severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes mutations in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> glucoronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene which is responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of UGT1A1 gene mutations in a group of Malay neonates to determine whether they are risk factors to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-five Malay neonates with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight infants without severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> were randomly selected from healthy Malay term infants (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA from EDTA cord blood samples were examined for UGT1A1 mutations nt211G &gt; A and nt247T &gt; C using established Taqman SNP genotyping assays and the UGT1A1*28 variant was detected by the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were also screened for common Malay G6PD variants using established techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of UGT1A1 211G &gt; A mutation is significantly higher in the severely hyperbilirubinemic group (13%) than the control group (4%; p = 0.015) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the positive cases were heterozygous for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the frequency of UGT1A1*28 mutation between the severely hyperbilirubinemic (3.5%) and the control group (0.01%; p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the neonates in both groups carried the nt247 T &gt; C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of G6PD mutation was significantly higher in the severely jaundiced group than control (9% vs 4%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nt 211 G &gt; A alleles constitute at least 12% of UGT1A1 mutations underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and appears to be a significant independent risk factor associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in the Malay newborns </plain></SENT>
