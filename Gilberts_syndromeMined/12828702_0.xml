<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A family that consisted of the father and his three children, two males and one female, having NF-1 is evaluated in detail for cosmetic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The routine preoperative laboratory examinations, including complete blood counts, serum biochemistries, urinary analysis, extremity and chest roentgenograms, ultrasounds of the abdomen and the affected regions, and pelvic computed tomographies, revealed characteristics of NF-1 and unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients are evaluated further for the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> by the fasting test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variously localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0009732'>plexiform neurofibromas</z:hpo> of the three children are totally excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The father was affected as a result of a mutation, and his three children had inherited the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The father, having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100698'>subcutaneous neurofibromas</z:hpo>, differs from the children, as they have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275120" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">elephantiasis neurofibromatosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The children had various rare clinical presentations besides disfiguring deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two male patients had retroperitoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromas</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and osseous changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> was diagnosed, interestingly, and coincidentally in the three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elephantiasis</z:e> due to NF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: An interesting diagnosis of NF occurring coincidentally with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> in a family is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This clinical study is the first report of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> accompanying familial NF </plain></SENT>
