<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a 1 g dose of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> h.s. the drug and its metabolites were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the overnight 8-h urine sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amounts of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> and of its metabolites recovered in urine were almost identical with those found in the control group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> ratio, which is considered to be an index of glucuronidation, was not correlated with the fraction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> present in plasma as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data do not suggest that in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> therapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> are associated with an increased risk for hepatic or systemic toxicity </plain></SENT>
