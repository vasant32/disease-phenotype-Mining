<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> cannot be found in about 45% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> (GS) is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the screening value of genetic tests cannot be fully determined until accurate data on the prevalence and penetrance of the GS genotype are known, we sought to estimate whether the prevalence of GS is higher in the parents of neonates with severe unexplained indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study of parents of neonates with severe unexplained indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> admitted to a neonatal ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the rifampin test (checked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> before and 4 hours after administration of 600 mg rifampin) for diagnosis of GS in parents of 115 neonates with severe unexplained indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of GS in these parents with that of a control group of 115 couples referred for premarital counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 115 neonates were aged 5.2 (1.6) days (mean, standard deviation), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were breast-fed, and males constituted 56.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (TSB) level was 20.96 (5.48) mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14.8% were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was present in 14.8%, and 10.4% had A, B or O blood group (ABO) incompatibilities with their mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the prevalence of GS between parents of the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (22.2%) and the control group (19.13%) (P=.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean TSB in neonates with parents who had GS was more (about 3 mg/dL) than in neonates with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parents (P=.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fathers had GS twice as often as the mothers among the parents of neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (P=.003), among the control group (P=.009) and among neonates (P=.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that GS cannot cause severe indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> by itself, but it may have a summative effect on rising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> when combined with other factors, for example, G6PD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that in GS, males are affected about twice as much as the females </plain></SENT>
