<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar concomitant effect has never been investigated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) patients, who by definition have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> higher than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to verify whether, in addition to the hyperbilirubinemic action, NA could induce parallel hypersideremia in GS subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data we obtained confirm in GS patients: 1. the well-known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>; 2. a delayed NA plasma concentration curve, and document that in GS the hypersideremic effect is comparable to that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous investigators reported that NA produces an equimolar rise of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and iron levels in healthy man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study the extent of the sideremic response to NA occurring in GS patients is comparable to that seen in controls, and appears unrelated to the bilirubinemic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the NA effects are based on the documented hemolytic properties of NA, a disturbance in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> handling by the liver of GS subjects appears to be plausible in the presence of almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> behavior of NA-induced hypersideremia </plain></SENT>
