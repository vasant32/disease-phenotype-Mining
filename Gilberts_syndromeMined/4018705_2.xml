<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for possible differences in hepatic clearance of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> (NA) and rifamycin-SV (R-SV) among GS patients, and examined the effect produced by these <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> on the plasma levels of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (UCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two subgroups of GS patients, GS1 and GS2, were differentiated according to their ability to handle R-SV and NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with a control group, the alteration of the half-life both of NA and R-SV was less marked in GS1 than in GS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UCB plasma concentration after NA and R-SV loading was more greatly increased in GS2 than in GS1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a striking correlation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects studied between UCB and the half-life of NA and R-SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These related alterations of plasma UCB and plasma half-life or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anions</z:chebi> suggests a common defect of hepatic uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that this defect is located at the level of a hepatic plasma membrane carrier </plain></SENT>
