<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it would be possible to argue that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> of HBV in hepatocytes might play a role in an hypothetical metabolic derangement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five subjects in a group of 468 HBsAg+ patients (equal to 5.33%) presented an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This percentage was not different from the 5.83% found in 3083 HBsAg- controls coming from the same institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore we could exclude that in our population the presence of HBV surface antigen itself would determine a statistically higher level of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (TB) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> (NA) loading test may reveal some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolic defects (i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>), even in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basal values of TB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to this background, we performed in 11 HBsAg+ males with basal TB higher than 17.1 mumol/l (1 mg%) (group A/1), 13 HBsAg+ males with basal TB lower or equal to 17.1 mumol/l (group A/2) and 14 HBsAg- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls matched for sex and age (group B) the NA test according to RÃ¶llinghoff et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the parameters calculated by the NA test resulted significantly different in the A/1 group compared with the B group, but not different from those found by several authors in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, no significant differences have been noticed between the latter group and the A/2 group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
