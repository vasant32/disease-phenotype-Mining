<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The precocious formation of bilirubinate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> is the most common complication of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo> (HS), and the prevention of this problem represents a major impetus for splenectomy in many patients with compensated <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> has been considered a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation, there are reasons for postulating that the association of this common inherited disorder of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism with HS could increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, 103 children with mild to moderate HS who, from age 1, have undergone a liver and biliary tree ultrasonography every year, were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2-bp (TA) insertion within the promoter of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1), associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, was screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was statistically different among the 3 groups of patients: homozygotes for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> UGT1A1 allele, heterozygotes, and homozygotes for the allele with the TA insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fitting a Cox regression model, in fact, a statistically significant hazard ratio of 2.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.31 to 3.66) was estimated from one to the next of these genetic classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The individual proneness to form <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> from TA insertion in the TATA-box of the UGT1A1 promoter should be considered during the follow-up of patients with HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although patients with HS were the only ones studied, extrapolating these data to patients who have different forms of inherited (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, intraerythrocytic enzymatic deficiency) or acquired (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> from mechanical heart valve replacement) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> can be warranted </plain></SENT>
