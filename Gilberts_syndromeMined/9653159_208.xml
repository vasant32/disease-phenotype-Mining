<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promoters containing seven <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (ta) repeats have been found to be less active than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> six repeats, and the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels of persons homozygous or even heterozygous for seven repeats have been found to be higher than those with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> six repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now examined the genotypes in persons of Asian, African, and Caucasian ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although within the Caucasian ethnic group there is a strong correlation between promoter repeat number and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level, between ethnic groups we found that this relationship to be inverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among people of African ancestry there are, in addition to those with six and seven repeats, also persons who have five or eight repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a reporter gene we show that there is an inverse relationship between the number of ta repeats and the activity of the promoter through the range of 5-8 ta repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An incidental finding was a polymorphism at nucleotide -106, tightly linked to the (ta)5 haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels are influenced by many factors, both genetic and environmental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the unstable UGT1A1 polymorphism may serve to "fine-tune" the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level within population groups, maintaining it at a high enough level to provide protection against oxidative damage, but at a level that is sufficiently low to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001343'>kernicterus</z:hpo> in infants </plain></SENT>
