<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (FH) is similar to that in human patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (BR) excretion (production) into bile was elevated two-fold in BoSM upon fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fraction of injected dose of 3 H-amino-levulinic acid (ALA) incorporated into biliary BR in fasted monkeys was of less magnitude than in fed monkeys and was associated with lower specific activities of 3 H-BR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the lower incorporation of ALA and lower specific activities of 3H-BR in fasted BoSM suggest that increased BR excreted may have arisen from pre-existing non-labeled pools of either <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> or BR </plain></SENT>
