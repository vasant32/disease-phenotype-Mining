<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is now firm evidence that phototherapy has the following effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It rather rapidly converts a substantial fraction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> toxic 4Z, 15Z form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> to the 4Z, 15E form, which probably is less toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously it enhances the overall excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> by converting it to oxidation products and structural and configurational isomers that are excretable in bile and urine without the need for glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We know that these reactions occur in vivo because we have synthesized the compounds involved and have identified them unambiguously in vivo in the tissues of jaundiced babies and rats undergoing phototherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that these photobiological effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism and transport are restricted to babies undergoing purposeful phototherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> babies are exposed to visible light and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> during early life, with many exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because there is no lower intensity threshold for photochemical reactions, it seems probable that the photobiological effects described in this paper occur in most newborns to some degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, similar photoprocesses would be expected to occur in the approximately 2-5% of the population who have the benign condition known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, particularly when they sunbathe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, in the particular instance of phototherapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo>, blue light is therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some respects it acts like a drug, almost like the ideal magic bullet, because it is specific for the target molecule and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main limitation of phototherapy is that it is inefficient, a limitation that seems to be imposed by transport processes in the body and the optics of skin rather than by the photochemical reactions on which it depends </plain></SENT>
