<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> is a potent endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest a direct relationship exists between urinary excretion of biopyrrins, a novel group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidative metabolites, and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate urinary excretion of biopyrrins in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> (n = 33) and healthy blood donors (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects complete biochemical tests were conducted along with analysis of urinary excretion of biopyrrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear and logistic regression analyses were used for multiple adjustments of possible confounders/modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, high serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> group as compared to controls (27.8 +/- 9.7 vs 9.9 +/- 3.0 micromol/L, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urinary levels of biopyrrins were substantially lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> group as compared to normobilirubinemic control subjects (19.9 +/- 26.0 vs 90.2 +/- 139.1 U/g urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> group also had very low prevalence odds ratios for urinary biopyrrins above the median of the control values even after adjustment for possibly confounding factors (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.94; P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship was demonstrated between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level and urinary excretion of biopyrrins, which is presumably due to antioxidative effects of elevated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
