<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effect is attributed to induction of the enzyme required for hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> elimination, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the expression and inducibility of UGT1A1 in human donor livers and their corresponding primary hepatocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody directed against the amino terminal of the human UGT1A1 isoform showed that 5 hepatocyte donors exhibited a &gt;50-fold difference in UGT1A1 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 protein level correlated strongly with both liver microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT activity and liver UGT1A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (r(2) =.82 and.72, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 patients with the lowest UGT1A1 levels, 3 were homozygotes for the UGT1A1 promoter variant sequence associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and the fourth was a heterozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 donors with the highest levels had a history of phenytoin exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatocytes isolated from the phenytoin-exposed donors exhibited marked declines in UGT1A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels during culturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction studies using hepatocytes treated for 48 hours with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> (2 mmol/L), oltipraz (50 micromol/L), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34342">3-methylcholanthrene</z:chebi> (2.5 micromol/L) revealed UGT1A1-inducing effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, oltipraz, and, in particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34342">3-methylcholanthrene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that both genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the marked interindividual variability in UGT1A1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An understanding of these mechanisms could lead to advances in the pharmacological therapy of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
