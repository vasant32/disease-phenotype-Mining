<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of the penultimate enzyme of haem biosynthesis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15435">protoporphyrinogen</z:chebi> (PROTO) oxidase was reduced at 3.1 +/- 2.6 nmol PROTO/g protein/h (mean +/- ISD) compared with 8.2 +/- 5.1 in controls (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a compensatory increase in the activity of the initial and rate controlling enzyme of the pathway delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) synthase at 866 +/- 636 nmol ALA/g/protein/h compared with 156 +/- 63 in controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike variegate <z:mp ids='MP_0005654'>porphyria</z:mp> in which there is a genetic deficiency of PROTO oxidase there was no increased excretion of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrins</z:chebi> or their precursors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
