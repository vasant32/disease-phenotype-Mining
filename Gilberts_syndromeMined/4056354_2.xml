<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> (NA)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> was compared with that resulting from caloric restriction in 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) and 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both tests resulted in a significant higher level of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in GS than in controls (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level 240 min after NA administration (5.9 mumol/kg i.v.) was higher than 18 mumoles/l, this test had a specificity and sensitivity of 100%, both in males and females with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory value of the test was lower when either the area under the time concentration curve or the maximal increment of serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction in caloric intake (400 calories/day) showed a lower specificity and sensitivity than the NA test, particularly in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> at 24 h greater than 15 mumoles/l was more diagnostic than an increase by 100% or more over the pre-diet value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was not improved by prolonging the test for additional 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that NA-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> and, in particular the concentration of the pigment 240 min after drug administration, is more efficient than fasting-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> in the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> both in males and in females </plain></SENT>
