<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pazopanib has shown clinical activity against multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types and is generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, isolated elevations in transaminases and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined polymorphisms in molecules involved in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of pazopanib and their association with hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight polymorphisms in 11 genes were evaluated in pazopanib-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An exploratory analysis was conducted in 116 patients from a phase II study; a replication study was conducted in 130 patients from a phase III study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No polymorphisms were associated with alanine aminotransferase elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Gilbert's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) TA-repeat polymorphism was significantly associated with pazopanib-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in the phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was replicated in the phase III study (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with TA6/TA6, TA6/TA7, and TA7/TA7 genotypes experienced median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> increases of 0.31, 0.37, and 0.71 x upper limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (ULN), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (&gt; or = 1.5 x ULN), 32 (84%) were either TA7 homozygotes (n=18) or TA7 heterozygotes (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For TA7 homozygotes, the odds ratio (95% CI) for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was 13.1 (5.3-32.2) compared with other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1 polymorphism is frequently associated with pazopanib-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that some instances of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in pazopanib-treated patients are benign manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, thus supporting continuation of pazopanib monotherapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
