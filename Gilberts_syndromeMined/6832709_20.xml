<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracted pigment was submitted to thin-layer chromatography, and the separated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> were either immediately eluted and determined spectrophotometrically or individually converted to ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16567">anthranilate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30106">azo</z:chebi> derivatives for thin-layer chromatographic analysis of each isolated pigment band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubins</z:chebi> in duodenal bile of eight healthy adults comprised 1.5 +/- 1.3% unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>-IX alpha, 69 +/- 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> diglucuronide, and 16 +/- 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mixed diconjugates containing one glucuronosyl moiety and either one xylosyl or one glucosyl group amounted to 10 +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most samples (6 of 8) contained trace amounts (0.6 +/- 0.6%) of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>-IX beta, in agreement with nearly exclusive cleavage of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> at the alpha-meso position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The composition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubins</z:chebi> in bile was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011980'>cholesterol gallstones</z:hpo>, 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, and 3 with <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>-IX alpha showed a fair positive correlation with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronide and was increased in half of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
