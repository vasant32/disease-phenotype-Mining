<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are a number of methods for gene analysis of a point mutation and deletion/insertion of several <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2011, we reported an improved hybridization probe methods (Hybri-Probe method) that are highly sensitive and accurate, and excellent in cost and time effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have developed the Multiplex Hybri Probe method for several types of mutations or polymorphisms including the microsatellite polymorphisms, especially of palindromic sequence such as (TA)n and (GC)n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, several mutations are analyzed at a time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this research we focused on the three types of polymorphism on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">Uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronyltransferase (UGT) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Design of the probes for the detection of UGT1A1*6(211 G --&gt; A G71R) and UGT1A1*27 (686 C --&gt; A P229Q) was not difficult because the mutations were a single base substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, UGT1A1*28 (A (TA)6TAA --&gt; A (TA)7TAA) has tandem and palindromic sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the probes to detect the mutation in such sequence resulted in failure, we made several mismatches, i.e., TATATATATATA --&gt; TATGTGTATATA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, the probes designed for the three polymorphisms above did not overlap in the Tm and were separated by approximately 10 degree intervals between 63.2 degrees C and 37.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this Multiplex Hybri-Probe method, the three kinds of probe are added tube into the PCR product in the same tube and followed by the measurement of the Tm using the LightCycler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is very simple, and performed by one step for any mutation including the microsatellite polymorphisms, and it also has good cost performance and favorable time efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It takes two hours including the running time of PCR for completion of the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may also be available to the detection of other gene abnormalities </plain></SENT>
