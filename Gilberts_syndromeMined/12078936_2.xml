<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elevated fluctuating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> are a common problem in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differentiation between a drug-related adverse event and the diagnostic symptom for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), an idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, is more or less impracticable since the diagnosis of GS is by exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the correlation of unspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0005344'>elevated bilirubin levels</z:mp> and the occurrence of GS with a described polymorphism in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18361">diphosphat</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) in a predominately Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>304 volunteers (152 male, 152 female) were genotyped for the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism by PCR amplification and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and liver enzymes were determined and GS was diagnosed using clinico-chemical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>23/13 subjects displayed the homocygote variant, 73/66 the heterozygote variant and 56/72 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> (male/female, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>23 male and 3 female volunteers fulfilled the clinical criteria for GS (15.1, respectively 2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men exhibited higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels than women with a mean (SD) of 14.37 (8.92) micromol/l compared to 10.17 (5.37) micromol/l, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The homocygote mutant promoter length correlated well with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and with the clinical diagnosis of GS (p &lt; 0.001 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism is a cheap and unequivocal method for predicting elevated and fluctuating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is better suited to this purpose than the clinical diagnosis which is based on exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The genotyping of UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism can help to improve safety and the reliable assessment of adverse events in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data additionally support the demand to refine the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> reference values </plain></SENT>
