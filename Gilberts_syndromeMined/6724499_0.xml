<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In GS the NA and R-SV uptake constants (K21) were significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In GS patients, simultaneous loads of NA and R-SV, the latter at increasing doses, produced: 1) a progressive lowering only of R-SV K21; and 2) an increase in R-SV hepatic plasma reflux (K12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in biliary excretion ( Kee ) and hepatocellular pool (Ke) of both NA and R-SV probably depend on the rates of uptake and reflux constants of the two <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study of the parameters of compartmental kinetics of NA and R-SV confirms that the two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anions</z:chebi>, which have different metabolic routes and/or a different affinity for intracellular carriers, share common uptake mechanisms </plain></SENT>
