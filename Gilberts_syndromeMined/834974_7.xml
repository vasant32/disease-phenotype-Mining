<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of 13 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> had liver copper content as high as seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WD|WND">hepatolenticular degeneration</z:e> (is greater than 250 mjg/g dry weight) </plain></SENT>
