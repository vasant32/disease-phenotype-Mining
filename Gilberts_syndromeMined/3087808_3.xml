<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distinctive patterns of bile pigment excretion occur in different species and in pathologic disorders (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human and monkey (Macaca fascicularis) bile, the proportion of BDG exceeds that of BMG and the C-8/C-12 BMG isomer ratio approaches unity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the patterns of BDG and BMG isomers in bile, we used a radiochemical assay to analyze the kinetics and regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase in microsomes prepared from monkey liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of BMG from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was a higher capacity, lower affinity step (Vmax = 295 pmol/mg protein X min, Km = 24 microM) than BDG synthesis from endogenously formed BMG (Vmax = 170 pmol/mg protein X min, Km = 14 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation was confirmed when biosynthetically prepared BMG was used as substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of formation of BDG relative to BMG was modulated by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> concentration, whereas the C-8/C-12 BMG isomer ratio was influenced exclusively by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data obtained with increasing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> concentration did not obey conventional single-site kinetics, suggesting the presence of more than one binding site on the enzyme or a membrane transporter for this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25609">nucleotide sugar</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase has a greater capacity for BMG than BDG synthesis, and thus support the concept that the decreased BDG/BMG ratio in the bile of patients with reduced hepatic enzyme activity (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and type II Crigler-Najjar disease) reflects the diminished capacity of the enzyme to synthesize BDG from BMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> concentrations both appear to be pivotal in regulating the synthesis of individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16427">bilirubin glucuronides</z:chebi> and hence the patterns of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugates excreted in bile </plain></SENT>
