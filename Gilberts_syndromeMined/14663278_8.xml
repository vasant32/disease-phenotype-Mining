<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Retrospective cholecystography studies in adults with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo> (HS) suggested detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> in 37% to 43% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since longitudinal studies using biliary ultrasonography are unavailable, the aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease, as detected by biliary ultrasonography, in children and young adults with HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As individuals with HS who co-inherit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> have a greater risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronyl transferase (UGT-1A) gene polymorphism was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated 44 patients aged 1.4 to 22 years with HS, 12 (27%) of whom underwent splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography was performed annually starting at the age of 4 years or at the time of diagnosis, if later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 44 patients, 18 (41%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> as demonstrated by gallbladder ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most patients (94%) the test first proved positive at age 4 to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with HS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> tended to be younger at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> was detected in children and young adults with HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To identify this complication, the authors recommend early annual biliary ultrasonography in HS children, starting at about 4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>, closer follow-up may be indicated </plain></SENT>
