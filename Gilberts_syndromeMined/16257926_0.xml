<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has long been suspected that the etiology of IPS is an early manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features common to both GS and IPS include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> precipitated by fasting and improved with feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> is similar to that of clinically apparent GS in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discovery of a mutation in the promoter region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyl transferase gene (UGT1A1*28) as the most common cause of GS has provided a tool to determine the role of GS in IPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine 1) the prevalence of IPS in a large group of infants with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>, 2) whether disease severity contributed to the manifestation of IPS, and 3) whether GS played a role in IPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radioactive PCR and sequencing were used to determine the presence of UGT1A1*28 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined a prevalence of IPS of 14.3% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infants with IPS had significantly higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> than infants with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GS mutations were 4-fold higher in IPS (43.8%) than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> is similar to that of clinically apparent GS in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Manifestation of IPS results from a more severe degree of metabolic disturbance and the presence of GS mutations </plain></SENT>
