<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In humans, data on biotransformation enzymes in the intestine, and to a lesser extent in the liver, are rather scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much knowledge about these enzymes is, therefore, obtained from animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were able to examine both small intestinal and hepatic tissue from a kidney donor and performed a systematic study on enzyme contents and distribution in these organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the small intestine the longitudinal distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>)-glucuronosyltransferase declined from duodenum to ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16836">4-nitrophenol</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17224">4-methylumbelliferone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase increased or remained constant, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and specific activity of most enzymes was much higher in the liver, except for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase, where the small intestine contained 28.6% and 7.4% of total hepatic activity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively great amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity in the small intestinal mucosa of this patient, who probably suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, could indicate that under pathological conditions intestinal metabolism may contribute significantly to the clearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a monoclonal antibody, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms were immunodetectable in microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the liver, two bands, one of 57 kilodaltons and one in between 53 and 54 kilodaltons, were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the proximal small intestine two isoforms (53 and 54 kilodaltons) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in the distal small intestine where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity was low, only one isoform (54 kilodaltons) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity is correlated with the 53-kilodalton isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in humans, similar to that described before in the rat, is further established by this study </plain></SENT>
