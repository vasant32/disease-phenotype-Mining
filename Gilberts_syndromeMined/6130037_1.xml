<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of plasma disappearance data was associated with an increase in uptake and conjugation, and a decrease in reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">Phenobarbital</z:chebi> treatment resulted in significant increases in serum GGT activity (p less than 0.05) and urinary d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17301">glucaric acid</z:chebi> excretion (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that measurement or urinary d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17301">glucaric acid</z:chebi> by short-term administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> may be a better clinical index for hepatic microsomal enzyme induction than serum GGT activity </plain></SENT>
