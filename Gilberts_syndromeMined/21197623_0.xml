<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted on 29 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS), and who were subjected to fasting test for diagnostic purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The uroflowmetric test was performed after 24 h of fasting and after 24 h of hypercaloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a 24 h fasting period, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in the serum was at its highest concentration, 31% of patients had abnormal uroflowmetric patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal uroflowmetric patterns had higher conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> after 24 h fasting period than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 24 h of hypercaloric intake, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 29 patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (bell-shaped) uroflowmetric pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> might be a predisposing factor for intermittent lower urinary tract dysfunction in children </plain></SENT>
