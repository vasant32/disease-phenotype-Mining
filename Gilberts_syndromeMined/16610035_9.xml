<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the variants in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) and to estimate the association between homozygosity for TA insertion and GS in India, as well as the frequency of TA insertion and its impact among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-five GS cases and 95 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver function and other tests were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 exons of UGT1A1 gene were resequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional assessment of a novel trinucleotide insertion was done by in silico analysis and by estimating UGT1A1 promoter activity carried out by luciferase reporter assay of appropriate constructs in Hep G2 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the GS patients, 80% were homozygous for the TA insertion, which was several-fold higher than reports from other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean UCB level was elevated among individuals with only one copy of this insertion, which was not significantly different from those with two copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many new DNA variants in UGT1A1 gene were discovered, including a trinucleotide (CAT) insertion in the promoter found in a subset (10%) of GS patients, but not among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-silico analysis showed marked changes in the DNA-folding of the promoter and functional analysis showed a 20-fold reduction in transcription efficiency of UGT1A1 gene resulting from this insertion, thereby significantly elevating the UCB level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The genetic epidemiology of GS is variable across ethnic groups and the epistatic interactions among UGT1A1 promoter variants modulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
