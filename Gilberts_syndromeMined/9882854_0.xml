<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To research the behaviour of one biliary acid (glyco-cholic) i.v. injected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> and in healthy controls, so that contribute to the knowledge of the pathophysiological correlate between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and biliary acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We include 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> and 7 healthy voluntary ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We injected i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17687">glycocholic acid</z:chebi> and obtained the clearance curve (CG-RIA Abbot method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the possible biostatistically significant differences between the obtained values of both groups though the non-parametric method of Mann-Whitney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clearance curve of both groups had a similar profile; biostatisticaly there are not significant differences between the serum values of glyco-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clearance of the glyco-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> had a similar behaviour as in healthy controls, without biostatisticaly significant differences between both groups </plain></SENT>
