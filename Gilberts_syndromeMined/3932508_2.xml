<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of his biliary bile pigments on two occasions showed (i) a decrease excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, as indirectly suggested by a high ratio of biliary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> over total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>; (ii) an increase in unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> IX alpha quantitated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) following alkaline methanolysis and by direct extraction and TLC of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26932">tetrapyrroles</z:chebi>; (iii) a high proportion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoconjugates whereas the excretion of diconjugates was very low </plain></SENT>
