<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicompartmental model of erythrokinetics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> production has been developed to predict the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phlebotomy on daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control values for four physiological variables including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover were determined in a 20-year-old woman with type I congenital nonhaemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With these base-line data, the model predicted the following changes during phlebotomy: a 34% fall in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover; a 240% increase in the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> content of bone-marrow erythroid precursors; a 25% fall in the half-life of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labelled erythrocytes; a characteristic alteration of the erythrocyte survival curve after labelling with [2-14C]glycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the assumption, previously validated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, that hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance was independent of turnover and would therefore remain unchanged, a fall in plasma unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration during phlebotomy from 436 to 282 mumol/1 was expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the patient underwent phlebotomy 350 ml/week for 2 months, and 500 ml/week during an additional 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appropriate studies during phlebotomy confirmed each of the predictions in paragraph 2 above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, turnover fell by 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, plasma unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> remained essentially unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analogous results were observed in phlebotomized jaundiced Gunn rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies in both the patient and the rats demonstrated that the failure of plasma unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> to fall in parallel with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover resulted from a prolongation of the terminal half-life of radioactively labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and a fall in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance in every instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that (a) in congenital non-haemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance is uniquely influenced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> turnover and (b) compartmental modelling and kinetic studies are useful for predicting and interpreting the results of both physiological experiments and experimental therapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
