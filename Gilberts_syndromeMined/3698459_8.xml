<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small amounts were excreted promptly in urine (0.1% to 5.6%) and more gradually in feces (3.7% to 11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only dose-limiting (greater than 1.0 mumol/kg, single dose) side effect was mild sensitivity to sunlight and long-wave ultraviolet light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absorption after intramuscular administration was rapid, but there was no absorption after oral dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In bile duct-ligated rats treated with Sn-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi>, there was a substantial (approximately 50%) reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels compared with levels in ligated control animals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these studies Sn-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (total doses of 0.25 to 2.0 mumol/kg body weight) reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels to a varying degree (7% to 43%) promptly after its intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
