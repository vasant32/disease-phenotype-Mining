<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity for the antiendomysium antibody-immunoglobulin A test were 92% and 100%, respectively, when considering the whole group of patients; however, the sensitivity (but not the specificity) decreased to 86% when taking into account only the group of patients with mild histologic alterations (Marsh type I, II, and IIIa).CONCLUSION: In general, the authors' results are similar to those described in developing countries, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> might have the same spectrum of presentation regardless of the region studied </plain></SENT>
