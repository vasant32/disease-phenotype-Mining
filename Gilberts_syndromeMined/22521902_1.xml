<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters in a clinical population remains poorly described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether persons expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> (GS; i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>) are protected from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> oxidation and to determine if this, in addition to their improved <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile, could explain reduced oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) status in them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four matched GS and control subjects were recruited and blood was prepared for the analysis of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and multiple plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GS subjects possessed elevated plasma reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> (8.03±1.09 versus 6.75±1.39 nmol/mg protein; P&lt;0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> concentrations (12.7±2.39 versus 9.44±2.45 μM; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> status (reduced:oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>; GSH:GSSG) was significantly improved in GS (0.49±0.16 versus 0.32±0.12; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> concentrations were negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations and were significantly lower in persons with &gt;40 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> versus controls (&lt;17.1 μmol/L; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, absolute oxLDL concentrations were significantly lower in GS subjects (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forward stepwise regression analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was associated with increased GSH:GSSG ratio and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> concentrations, which, in addition to reduced circulating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, probably decreased oxLDL concentrations within the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a marked reduction in total cholesterol concentrations in hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats is presented (Gunn 0.57±0.09 versus control 1.69±0.40 mmol/L; P&lt;0.001), arguing for a novel role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in modulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate the physiological importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in protecting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> and subsequent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> oxidation, in addition to reducing circulating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
