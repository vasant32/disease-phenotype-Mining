<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fractionation of the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> into direct and indirect-reacting components has been used in the differentiation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e> from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that patients with indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> usually have total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations less than 5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clinically useful methods of fractionating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> must yield reliable results in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experience with 4 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> indicated that conflicting results could be obtained from two different laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a panel of hyperbilirubinemic sera were submitted to four different laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While there was general agreement in sera containing high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, marked variations were observed in the results reported on sera with less than 5 mg/dl total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, clinical and other laboratory parameters were reviewed in patients who had had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> fractionation performed by one or the other of two routine laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one laboratory, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> fractionation correctly distinguished patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e>, while the other laboratory was not able to differentiate patients on the basis of this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that despite the general reported agreement in standard methods for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> fractionation there may be marked differences among methods in ability to reliably fractionate sera with total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations less than 5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
