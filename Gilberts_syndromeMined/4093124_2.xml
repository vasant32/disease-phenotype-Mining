<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, NA produces a number of vascular <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi>-mediated side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve the NA test we evaluated the influence of pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi>, a PG-synthetase inhibitor, both on side effects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NA (5.9 mumoles/kg of body weight i.v.) was administered on two separate occasions, before and one hour after i.m. injection of 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> in 11 GS males and 11 controls matched for sex and age (age range 18.34 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hyperbilirubinemic effect of NA was not modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> in any subject; the side effects were either significantly reduced or completely abolished </plain></SENT>
