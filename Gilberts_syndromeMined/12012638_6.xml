<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GS was significantly higher in the hyperbilirubinemic group, even though neither the peak of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, nor the day on which the highest value was found, differed according to genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The normalization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels was slower in neonates with GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the idea that GS is one of the factors contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, but that other factors play a role in determining <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The slower decrease of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in A(TA)7TAA homozygous neonates confirms that GS is an important factor in determining a <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>prolonged neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
