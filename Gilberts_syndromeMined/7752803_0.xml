<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up of 1-15 years a typical constellation was detectable: longterm elevation of GGT (average 47-156 U/l, moreover a smaller degree of elevation of GLDH and GPT), minimal deviations from norm in liver histology (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001405'>periportal fibrosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> degeneration), and functional abdominal complaints </plain></SENT>
