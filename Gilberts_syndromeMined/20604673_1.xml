<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> has been reported as a strong negative predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to evaluate the association between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and SLE manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed with 259 SLE patients, diagnosed according to American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatism</z:e> Association (ARA) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of these patients, having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hepatic function (n = 218, mean age 39.5 years), was studied in greater detail to eliminate the possible confounding effects of any underlying or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860207" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug-induced liver disease</z:e> on the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-matched healthy subjects (n = 180) served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A standard biochemical and immunological work-up was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the controls, substantially lower levels of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were detected in SLE patients (p &lt; 10⁻⁵); these were inversely correlated with disease activity and extent (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, each 1 μmol/L decrease in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was associated with a 37% increase in the odds for a positive SLE status [odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-1.47, p &lt; 10⁻⁵] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> (a phenotypic sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) were more than four times lower in SLE patients (OR 0.235, 95% CI 0.072-0.764, p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> represented a strong predictor of the manifestation of SLE symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most likely explanation for this finding is the increased consumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> due to the severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> accompanying SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects with higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels, such as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, might be protected from the development of SLE </plain></SENT>
