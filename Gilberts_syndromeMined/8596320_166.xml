<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is ill-defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This common mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> sometimes presents as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001046'>intermittent jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduced hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UPD- glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is associated with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined variation in the gene encoding the UGT1*1 enzyme and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in a Scottish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood was collected from 12 patients with confirmed or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, from 6 members of a family with 4 Gilbert members, and from 77 non-smoking, alcohol-free, drug-free volunteers recruited from the staff of a teaching hospital in Dundee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to examine sequence variation of the promoter upstream of the UGT1*1 exon I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were assigned as follows: 6/6 (homozygous for a common allele bearing the sequence [TA](6)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>), 7/7 (homozygous for a rarer allele with the sequence [TA](7)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>), and 6/7 (heterozygous with one of each allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Individuals in the population with the 7/7 genotype had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations than those who had the 6/7 or 6/6 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14 volunteers underwent a 24 h fasting test to see if they had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four positives had the 7/7 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One confirmed Gilbert's patient, two recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> patients (with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>), and nine clinically diagnosed cases had the 7/7 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Segregation of the 7/7 genotype with the Gilbert phenotype was also demonstrated in the family with four affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 7/7 genotype in this eastern Scottish population was 10-13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In a healthy population there was an association between variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration and a mutation within the gene encoding the enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This and other findings suggest the existence of a mild and a more severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, depending on whether the gene defect lies in the promoter sequence upstream of UGT1*I exon I, as here (mild), or in the coding sequence (severe) of the gene </plain></SENT>
