<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> or hepato-cellular failure was demonstrated.The effect of novobiocin on serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was studied by administering 2 g. of the drug daily in four divided oral doses for two days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was nearly always observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This rise was particularly significant in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After an oral dose of 500 mg. the BSP clearance was decreased after one hour and it was close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> is not responsible for this elevation of serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, the novobiocin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> appears to be due to a direct effect of the drug upon the liver </plain></SENT>
