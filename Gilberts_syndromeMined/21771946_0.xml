<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 promoter genotype also correlates with toxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current closed-tube assays for genotyping the UGT1A1 (TA)(n) promoter polymorphism require multiple labeled probes and/or have difficulty classifying the (TA)(5) and (TA)(8) alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An unlabeled 5' extension on one primer that creates a hairpin after asymmetric PCR was used to develop a snapback primer high-resolution melting assay for the (TA)(n) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A new method that plots the local deviation from exponential decay to improve genotype clustering was used to remove background fluorescence and to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The snapback assay was compared with small-amplicon melting and fragment length analyses in a blinded study of DNA samples from 100 African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotyping results obtained by small-amplicon melting and snapback primer melting were 83% and 99% concordant, respectively, with results obtained by fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reanalysis of the single discordant sample in the results of the snapback genotyping assay and the fragment analysis revealed an error in the fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-resolution melting was required for accurate snapback genotyping of the UGT1A1 (TA)(n) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 100% accuracy obtained with a capillary-based instrument fell to â‰¤81% with plate-based instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to small-amplicon genotyping, snapback primer genotyping can distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UGT1A1 promoter genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rapid-cycle PCR combined with snapback primer analysis with only 2 unlabeled PCR primers (one with a 5' extension) and a saturating DNA dye can genotype loci with several alleles in &lt;30 min </plain></SENT>
