<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has often been underestimated and undiagnosed because of its mild symptoms; although it is not as rare as was once believed when its frequency was estimated using data originating from biochemical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on molecular techniques, the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> has changed, increasing to 10% in the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This molecular defect was described, by Bosma et al, in 1995, and affects the promoter region of the UGT 1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case report, our aim is to present a new combination of two molecular defects in a Greek patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 13-year-old Greek girl was examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> using molecular techniques, and an uncommon genotype was revealed comprising the rare mutation G71R in trans with A(TA)7TAA motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The G71R mutation according to the literature, as well as our epidemiological data, is rare in Caucasians, while it is common in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first case study in the Greek population to report a new genotype for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> manifestation in the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
