<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate patients of NASH for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty-seven patients of NASH were studied for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were worked up for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and hemolytic work up and fasting test were done in those found with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five out of 67 patients (7.5%) of NASH were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though the fasting test was not positive, they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a negative hemolytic workup and none of them had underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> were similar to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in patients with NASH may suggest an associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
