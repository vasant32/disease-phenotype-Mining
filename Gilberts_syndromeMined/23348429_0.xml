<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> on the mean platelet volume (MPV) and other hematological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two men and 36 women (a total of 68 Gilbert's syndrome patients) and a similar age group of 68 healthy individuals (32 men and 36 women) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic tests, C-reactive protein (CRP) and biochemical values of the two groups were checked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPV level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> group was 7.8 ± 1.0 fl and CRP 0.2 ± 0.27 mg/dl </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPV of patients group (P &lt; 0.001) and CRP (P = 0.037) were significantly lower than the control group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and decreasing levels of MPV and CRP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients may have an effect on the slowing down of the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
