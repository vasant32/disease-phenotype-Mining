<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: GS was diagnosed in 88 patients aged 15-72 years using clinical and genetic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotyping has detected changes in promotor part of the gene coding uridindiphosphateglucuroniltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In homozygous carriers GS was characterized by a higher baseline level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, distinct response to functional tests, frequent combination with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In heterozygous patients GS often ran latently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Four variants of GS course were established: dispepsic, asthenovegetative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, latent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-caloric diet followed by fenobarbital raised sensitivity and specificity of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clinical classification of GS is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detected disorders of antipirin pharmacokinetics allow prognosis of the risk of unwanted reactions to the drugs metabolized by monooxigenases of the liver </plain></SENT>
