<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect is higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) and this test has been used in the diagnosis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After administration of 5.9 mumol NA/kg body weight, the maximal increment of serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and the area under the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration time curve (AUC) were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in GS males than in GS females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The half-life of the first fast slope of plasma disappearance curve of the drug was also significantly prolonged in GS males as compared to GS females (15.91 +/- 1.12 vs 9.13 +/- 1.25 min, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> increment and AUC were linearly correlated (P less than 0.01) with NA plasma half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purified preparations of bilitranslocase, a liver plasma-membrane protein involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and sulfobromophthalein (BSP) transport, specifically bound NA and the drug competitively inhibited BSP uptake in rat liver plasma membrane vesicles (Ki = 50 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, in addition to the hemolytic effect of the drug, NA-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> could be also due to a competition between the two <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> at the sinusoidal plasma membrane level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible implication of bilitranslocase in GS is considered </plain></SENT>
