<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since some problems in the standardization of this already published molecular protocol were found, we tried to improve this method in order to correctly set up the amplification and melting profile steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under our standardized conditions, we were able to perfectly distinguish the three different UGT1A1 genotypes since each one showed a peculiar melting behavior, as compared with those previously published by another group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, some suggestions and indications are provided for laboratory specialists interested in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we underline the need of more standardized protocols above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> when they are used for clinical diagnostics </plain></SENT>
