<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report on an infrequent association of pathologies causing considerable increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> production and a significant decrease in its excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION: The third pregnancy of an RhD negative woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her first child was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and delivered to term and did not receive Rhogam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second pregnancy was problematic due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rh isoimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She delivered a child to term, who required three exchange transfusions, but died on the 8th day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third child was delivered at term, ORh positive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004844'>direct Coombs positive</z:hpo> and had stump <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> of 6.5 mg/dl and hematocrit at 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five hours after birth the child was jaundiced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">Phenobarbital</z:chebi> and intensive phototherapy were introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>Hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was soon controlled, but relapsed whenever phototherapy was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day of life the child received a transfusion for significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> persisted to the 13th day, associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> was considered and DNA sequence analysis was requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The test demonstrated a mutant homozygote genotype UDPT1A1[TA]7TAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Phototherapy remained necessary until the 17th day of life and she was discharged from hospital the following day, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinemia</z:e> had been controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>She returned for follow-up and exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and neurological development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>COMMENTS: This case demonstrates the significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003573'>increased bilirubin</z:hpo> production/decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> excretion causing intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemias</z:hpo> and, in the absence of vigorous treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001343'>kernicterus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of intense phototherapy has also been demonstrated, reducing the risks of more aggressive treatments such as exchange transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It also provides evidence of the importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinemia</z:e> follow-up until complete resolution </plain></SENT>
