<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Breast milk <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> is a common problem in nursing infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been ascribed to various breast milk substances, but the component or combination of components that is responsible remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During our study of defects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) in patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, we encountered a prolonged case associated with breastfeeding; after cessation of breastfeeding, the infant's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis revealed a missense mutation identical to that found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, which usually causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> after puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT1A1 of infants with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> associated with breast milk to ascertain whether genetic factors are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and METHODS: We analyzed 17 breastfed Japanese infants with apparent prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> (total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations above 171 micromol/L [10 mg/dL]) 3 weeks to 1 month after their birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, the infants were healthy and did not show evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After cessation of breastfeeding, the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration began to decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When breastfeeding was resumed, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration again became elevated in some infants, but the concentration fell to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by 4 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the polymerase chain reaction-amplified exon, promoter, and enhancer regions of UGT1A1 by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen infants had at least one mutation of the UGT1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven were homozygous for 211G--&gt;A (G71R), which is the most common mutation detected in the East Asian population, and the mutant enzyme had one third of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>G71R is the most common missense mutation we found in our analyses in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and it corresponds to a UGT1A1 polymorphism in the Japanese population (the allele frequency is.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One was heterozygous for 1456T--&gt;G (Y486D) and homozygous for 211G--&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six were heterozygous for 211G--&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One was heterozygous for both 211G--&gt;A and a TATA box mutation (A(TA)7TAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One had a heterozygous mutation in an enhancer region (C--&gt;A at -1353) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We did not detect a homozygous A(TA)7TAA mutation, which was the most common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in European population, in this study of Japanese infants with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> triggered by breast milk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that defects of UGT1A1 are an underlying cause of the prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> associated with breast milk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One or more components in the milk may trigger the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in infants who have such mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The mutations we found were identical to those detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a risk factor of neonatal nonphysiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and a genetic factor in fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
