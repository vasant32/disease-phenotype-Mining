<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The laboratory findings were RBC: 597 x 10(4)/microliter, Hb: 13.1 g/dl, Ht: 40.8%, MCV: 70fl, MCH: 22pg, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>: 3.2 mg/dl (indirect: 2.2 mg/dl), s-Fe: 99 micrograms/dl, and ferritin: 25 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine liver function tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> except for an increase in serum indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased erythrocyte osmotic fragility was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's mother and sister also showed microcytic hypochromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of genomic DNA from this patient, his mother, and his sister confirmed the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha-thalassemia trait</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (B-UGT 1) gene mutation and the findings of the fasting test indicated the simultaneous presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of these two diseases in the same patient appears to be rare, especially in Japan because of the low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was caused by decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> clearance, not by increased erythrocyte destruction </plain></SENT>
