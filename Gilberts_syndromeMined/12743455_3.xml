<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether a TATA box polymorphism in the promoter of the UGT1*1 exon I, the most common detected DNA polymorphism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, is a contributory factor in unexplained pathologic or prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>38 neonates who had unexplained pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, 37 neonates who had unexplained prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, and 35 healthy, nonjaundiced neonates were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were assigned as follows: 6/6 (homozygous for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele bearing the sequence [TA](6)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>), 7/7 (homozygous for an abnormal allele with the sequence [TA](7)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>), and 6/7 (heterozygous with one of each allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 110 infants, 10 (9%) had 7/7, 51 (46%) had 6/7, and 49 (45%) had 6/6 genotype; the differences between the three groups were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also no differences were observed among different genotypes and mean serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that TA 7/7 and TA 6/7 genotypes are not rare in our population and that the presence of these polymorphisms alone does not play a significant role in the etiology of unexplained pathologic or prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
