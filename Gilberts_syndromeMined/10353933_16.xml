<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of nonphysiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is twice as high in East Asians as in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the condition was associated with mutations in the gene for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), a key enzyme of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> catabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We analyzed the UGT1A1 gene in 25 Japanese neonates who had nonphysiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> &gt;257 micromol/L) with no obvious cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received phototherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The background control population consisted of 50 Japanese neonates whose transcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> index was monitored during the first week of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected mutations by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a polymorphism for UGT1A1 in exon 1; a G--&gt;A transition at nucleotide 211 caused arginine to replace glycine at position 71 of corresponding protein product (G71R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutated allele in the hyperbilirubinemic group (0.34) was significantly higher (chi2 = 5.56) than in the control group (0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group the peak transcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> index of the carriers of G71R was significantly higher than it was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The missense mutation causing G71R is the first reported polymorphism for UGT1A1, and the mutation is a risk factor for nonphysiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in the Japanese may be attributable to the high frequency of this missense mutation </plain></SENT>
