<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and the Gilbert genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decedents who underwent autopsy were categorized into none/mild, moderate, and severe CAD groups based on autopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Known CAD risk factors were evaluated for each decedent in the severe CAD group (n=35), and for an age, race, and sex-matched control group with none/mild CAD (n=45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was tested for UGT1A1 promoter variants by polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully apply UGT1A1 promoter genotyping to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which may facilitate more thorough examination of clinicopathologic correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Gilbert genotype was compared between the none/mild cohort and the severe cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 promoter genotype data were obtained for 76/80 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of the Gilbert genotype compared well with previously reported frequencies at 16%, with a frequency of 16% in the none/mild CAD group and 15% in the severe CAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that UGT1A1 promoter genotype is not a major factor contributing to risk of CAD </plain></SENT>
