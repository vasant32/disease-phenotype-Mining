<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered (100 mg/kg orally) to male, Wistar rats for three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment raised the weight of the liver, the content of liver microsomal protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> p-450 and shortened the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5706">hexobarbital</z:chebi> sleeping time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> p-450 dependent biotransformation was found by in vitro methods in 9000-g supernatant of liver homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a growth in biotransformation of substrates of type I (ethylmorphine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="160246">aminopyrine</z:chebi>) and an extreme increase in reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27798">nitrobenzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find any change in biotransformation of the type-II substrate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, there was a decrease in the level of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and increase of D-glucuric-acid output in urine and bromsulphophthalein transport maximum following the treatment of this drug given in 150 mg/day orally for three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After this treatment, the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi>-transpeptides did not change </plain></SENT>
