<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: sd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were investigated in subjects with GS (n=42) and compared to healthy controls (n=52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) distributions were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and hs-CRP levels were lower in GS than the healthy controls (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001 and p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was negatively correlated with sd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and hs-CRP (r=-0.594, p&lt;0.001; r=-0.249, p=0.016 and r=-0.373, p&lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, sd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> was positively correlated with ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (r=0.307, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this preliminary study suggest that reduced sd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and hs-CRP levels may have a role in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in subjects with GS </plain></SENT>
