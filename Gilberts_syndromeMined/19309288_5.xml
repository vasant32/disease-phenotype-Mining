<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three genotypes were found: 7/7 (17.8% in controls and 23.3% in patients), 6/7 (33.5% in controls and 46.5% in patients), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homozygous 6/6 (48.7% in controls and 30.3% in patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Gilbert UGT1A1 genotypes 6/7 and 7/7 show significant association (odds ratio 2.225, 95% confidence interval 1.373-3.605, p=0.001, and odds ratio 2.101, 95% confidence interval 1.171-3.770, p=0.013, respectively) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This association supports the theory that genetic factors are responsible for a fraction of symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease; however, further studies are required in different ethnic groups to fully elucidate the involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
