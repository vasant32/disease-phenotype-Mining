<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The father and two living siblings had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's liver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>-diphospho-glucuronyl-transferase activity (UDPGT) was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the family members underwent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> (NA) load to test hepatic uptake capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This test, and NA half-life were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the patient and in her mother, and altered in the other relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of the hyperbilirubinemic response to NA load, and of the NA half-life, together with physical examination over a one-year period were in good agreement with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in the patient's father and siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that different impairments of hepatic handling of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anions</z:chebi> may be present in members of families with non-hemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilirubinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
