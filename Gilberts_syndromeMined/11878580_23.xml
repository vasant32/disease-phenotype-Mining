<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of UGT1A promoter polymorphisms on serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation were studied in a cohort of children with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The UGT1A promoter genotype was deterrmined for 115 consecutive children with SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Steady-state laboratory parameters and previous cholecystectomy for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> were recorded retrospectively, then analyzed according to UGT1A genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with SCA had a lower frequency of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (TA)6 UGT1A promoter allele (0.413) than the abnormal (TA)7 allele (0.461) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A previously described shorter (TA)5 allele (frequency 0.074) and longer (TA)8 allele (frequency 0.052) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with the 7/7 UGT1A genotype had a significantly higher mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level (5.8 +/- 3.1 mg/dL) than those with the 6/6 (2.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL) or 6/7 genotype (3.0 +/- 1.1 mg/dL; P &lt; 0.001 by analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with the 7/7 genotype were more likely to have previous cholecystectomy (87.5%) than those with the 6/6 (35.7%) or the 6/7 genotype (36.1%; P = 0.002 by chi2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in the UGT1A promoter significantly influences serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and the development of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> in children with SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A promoter polymorphisms represent an important nonglobin genetic modifier of clinical disease expression in SCA </plain></SENT>
