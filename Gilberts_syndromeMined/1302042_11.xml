<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen (<z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>) is extensively conjugated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> prior to renal excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A minor metabolic route involves microsomal oxidation of acetaminophen to a hepatotoxic reactive intermediate, which subsequently undergoes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) conjugation, yielding cysteine and mercapturate conjugates, both of which are excreted in the urine (Slattery et al., 1987) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected by de Morais et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1989) indicated that in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, glucuronidation of acetaminophen was impaired in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a genetically-based impairment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, inter-subject and ethnic differences in acetaminophen disposition have pharmacogenetic and toxicological implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was conceived to explore these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary excretion of acetaminophen and its metabolites was observed in 125 Caucasian and 33 Oriental subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No appreciable difference was noted in the mean fraction of drug excreted as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> between the two groups (51.5% in Caucasians vs 51.8% in Orientals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the data strongly indicated that the excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32636">acetaminophen glucuronide</z:chebi> was not normally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bimodality was apparent in both groups, with 20% of Caucasian and 33% of Oriental subjects displaying relatively extensive glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, glucuronidation displayed a strong negative correlation with sulfation (r = -0.97), suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism between the two metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean fractional excretions of cysteine and mercapturate conjugates did show significant differences between Caucasians and Orientals (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ratio of mercapturate to total GSH-derived conjugates recovered appeared to be bimodal, indicating possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the conversion of the cysteine conjugate to mercapturate via N-acetylation </plain></SENT>
