<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) is a promising antitumor agent, recently approved for use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its active metabolite, SN-38, is glucuronidated by hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan therapy is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, which is believed to be secondary to the biliary excretion of SN-38, the extent of which is determined by SN-38 glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the specific isoform of UGT involved in SN-38 glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro glucuronidation of SN-38 was screened in hepatic microsomes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (n = 4), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> humans (n = 25), Gunn rats (n = 3), and patients (n = 4) with Crigler-Najjar type I (CN-I) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A wide intersubject variability in in vitro SN-38 glucuronide formation rates was found in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gunn rats and CN-I patients lacked SN-38 glucuronidating activity, indicating the role of UGT1 isoform in SN-38 glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between SN-38 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> glucuronidation (r = 0.89; P = 0.001), whereas there was a poor relationship between para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi> and SN-38 glucuronidation (r = 0.08; P = 0.703) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intact SN-38 glucuronidation was observed only in HK293 cells transfected with the UGT1A1 isozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that UGT1A1 is the isoform responsible for SN-38 glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a genetic predisposition to the metabolism of irinotecan, suggesting that patients with low UGT1A1 activity, such as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, may be at an increased risk for irinotecan toxicity </plain></SENT>
