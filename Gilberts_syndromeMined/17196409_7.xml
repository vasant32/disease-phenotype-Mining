<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causative mutation in Caucasians is almost exclusively a TA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> insertion in the TATA box of the UGT1A1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals are homozygous for the variant promoter and have 7 instead of 6 TA repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the genotypes of UGT1A1(TA)n promoter polymorphism in the healthy Slovenian population and to investigate the association of genotypes with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>236 healthy subjects were genotyped by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, which was validated by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of genotypes were as follows: (TA)(6/6) (38.1%), (TA)(6/7) (47.9%), (TA)(7/7) (13.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant association of genotypes with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with genotype (TA)(7/7) had the highest and subjects with genotype (TA)(6/6) the lowest total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One individual in the group had the rare genotype (TA)(7/8) (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of his family showed the following genotypes: (TA)(6/8) in his father and sister and (TA)(7/8) in his two brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of UGT1A1(TA)n promoter polymorphism genotypes was determined for the first time in the Slovenian population and is similar to frequencies observed in other Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The extremely rare (TA)8 allele in Caucasians was found also in Slovenians </plain></SENT>
