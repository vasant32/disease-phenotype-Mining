<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An expression study in COS cells in vitro, using the expression vector pcDL that carried the mutated gene for UGT from a patient, indicated that approximately 14% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> UGT activity was expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the UGT activity of the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> was unexpectedly &lt; 50% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, perhaps as the result of the dominant negative nature of the mutation </plain></SENT>
