<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently, it has been proposed that decreased intestinal motility in fasting-induced hyperbilirubinemic rats probably results in an increase in the enterohepatic cycling of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association among gastric emptying, intestinal transit time, and serum unconjugated levels in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Ten subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> were included in this study according to the following criteria: fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>; no <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> and free of any medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, healthy volunteers acted as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying and intestinal transit time were evaluated after overnight fasting by administration of a standard meal mixed with 1-2ci of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi>-labeled diethylene-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38751">triamine</z:chebi>-pentacetic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The gastric emptying in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> subjects was 134.1 +/- 38.9 and 90.9 +/- 6.5 min in controls, P &lt; 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was a tendency to have a shorter intestinal transit time in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, 138.3 +/- 59.0, than in control subjects, 183.8 +/- 11.3 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (mg/dL) were 2.6 +/- 1.04 and 0.95 +/- 0.34, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gastric emptying is delayed significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, and intestinal transit time differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> subjects and controls were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
