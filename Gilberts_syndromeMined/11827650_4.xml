<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A relationship between polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>) and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> has recently been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is due to (TA)7 instead of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (TA)6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> by evaluating the distribution of (TA)7 in a population of newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 136 newborns were studied: 21 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo>, 69 were healthy and the remaining newborns had various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA from each patient was used to amplify, by polymerase chain reaction, the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, which flanks the TATA box where the polymorphism is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the group without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, 53 % of the newborns were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (6/6 genotype), 40 % were 6/7 and 7 % were 7/7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, 33 % of the newborns were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 53 % were heterozygous (6/7) and 14 % were homozygous (7/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the groups revealed that the prevalence of UGTA1A polymorphism tended to be greater among jaundiced newborns (p 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that there is a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> among the Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results, together with those of other authors, suggest that genetic screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> should be included in the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies with a greater number of subjects would determine the exact relationship between marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> and IGTA1A polymorphism </plain></SENT>
