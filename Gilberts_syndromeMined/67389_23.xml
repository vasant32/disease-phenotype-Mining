<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both sexes showed skewed distributions for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration, but analysis of the data showed no evidence of bimodality for either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that people who are now diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e> may constitute upper end of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range rather than a disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The term "constitutional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e>" is preferable, and its use can be coupled with reassurance to the patient that the condition causes no symptoms </plain></SENT>
