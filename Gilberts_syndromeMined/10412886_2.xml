<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to investigate the possible effects of this disorder on the metabolism of a drug, such as <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, which is basically eliminated by hepatic glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 32 healthy volunteers and 18 people with GS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were given 1.5 g of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 24 h urine collected, we determined the elimination of free <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, the conjugates (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>) and the oxidation products (cysteine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">mercapturic acid</z:chebi>) by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results are given as a percentage of the total quantity of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with GS were divided into 2 subgroups (GS-I and GS-II) according to whether glucuronidation was more or less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall results of the GS group showed no significant difference in the urinary elimination of metabolites as compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in subgroup GS-I, a reduction in glucuronidation (P = 0.0012) and an increase in oxidation (P = 0.0051) was seen, as compared with the other 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was inverse correlation between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> produced by conjugation and the oxidation products (r = -0.8718; P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>People with GS are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group with respect to the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one subgroup this was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the other subgroup there was a marked reduction in glucuronidation and an increase in oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes could mean that people in this subgroup are more liable to liver damage after an overdose of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
