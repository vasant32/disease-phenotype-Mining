<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients showed gross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were designated Gilbert's EM Positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12, designated Gilbert's EM Negative, did not differ significantly from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EM Positive group showed a significantly greater percentage response to caloric restriction (P less than 0.01) and an exaggerated response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> stimulation when compared with the EM Negative group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SER <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> is not, as previously suggested, a constant feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> but rather a characteristic of a distinct subpopulation </plain></SENT>
