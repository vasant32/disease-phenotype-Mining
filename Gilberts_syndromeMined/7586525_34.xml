<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A U-shaped relationship was observed between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was associated with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, in particular smoking, low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, low forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and low serum albumin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with men in the lowest fifth of the distribution (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> &lt; 7 mumol/L), those in the middle range (8-9 mumol/L) showed a 30% reduction in relative risk [RR = 0.68 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.89)] in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, whereas men in the top fifth (&gt; 12 mumol/L) showed similar risk to the lowest fifth [RR = 0.99 (95% confidence intervals 0.73-1.34)], which persisted after exclusion of men with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> &gt; 17 mumol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significance of this U-shaped relationship is unclear, but it could be interpreted as support for the role of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
