<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken in the Wistar R/A Pfd rat to investigate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> on the maximal biliary excretion (Tm) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and on the concentration and composition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in liver and plasma at the end of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo> caused a cholestatic condition with a 50% decrease in bile flow and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> Tm, and with an increased proportion of conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in liver and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an increased ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> diconjugates to monoconjugates in bile, liver, and plasma, which can be ascribed to the increased hepatic conjugation activity towards <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and/or to the prolonged retention of bile pigments in the hepatocytes with increased conversion of monoconjugates to diconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>Cholestasis</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> was further characterized by a decreased biliary output of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter phenomenon might represent an indirect effect related to a decreased output of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoconjugates with impaired hydrolysis to unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>; it might also reflect the cholestatic condition with decreased excretion of the unesterified bile pigment as such </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>Hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> resulted in a 1.3-1.4-fold increase in bile flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration in bile decreased 1.3-1.4-fold, so that the apparent maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> excretion rate remained unchanged at 115 nmol.min-1.100 g-1, as observed in untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>Hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> lowered the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase activity, produced a decreased ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> di- to monoconjugates in bile and plasma, and a decreased ratio of conjugated to total bile pigment concentration in liver and in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings are present in the heterozygous Gunn rat strain and in patients with hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose the hyperthyroid rat as an experimental animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
