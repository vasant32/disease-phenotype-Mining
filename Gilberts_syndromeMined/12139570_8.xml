<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is a common inherited disorder of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> metabolism contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> and causing recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> after the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, mutations have been reported in the promoter and exons of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyl transferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene on chromsome 2q37, which encodes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, including its <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> trait, remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients 1 and 2 were Thai sisters with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>prolonged neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> and showed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> after their infancy, while the parents showed no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To search for the mutation in the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons of the UGT1A1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutation in controls was studied by PCR-restriction enzyme digestion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were homozygous for a novel single transition of T to C at nucleotide position 247 (exon 1), which would predict a substitution of leucine for phenylalanine at codon 83 of the enzyme protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other mutation was detected in any regions except exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The parents with no symptoms showed heterozygosity for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 110 Japanese controls, no homozygous individuals and three heterozygous individuals for the mutation were identified, giving a mutated allele frequency of 0.0136 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene was identified in two Thai siblings with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The affected family showed that homozygosity for the mutation may lead to apparent symptoms and that the syndrome was inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mutation does not explain a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> in Japan, because it is very rare in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
