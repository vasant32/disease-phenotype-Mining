<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increments in serum concentrations of unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured 24 and 48 h after reduction of the caloric intake (400 cal/day) in 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (GS) and in 12 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In males, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and with GS, the rise in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was statistically higher (p less than 0.01) as compared to females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, no sex difference was found in FFA concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A linear correlation (p less than 0.01) between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and FFA serum levels was present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> males and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and FFA partly share a common, bilitranslocase-mediated, hepatic uptake mechanism, data reported support the hypothesis that a bilitranslocase function may be one of the metabolic defects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
