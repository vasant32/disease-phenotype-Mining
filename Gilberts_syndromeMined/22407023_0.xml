<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most devastating clinical consequence of this deficit is severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo>, which results in sensorineural deficit, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, patients may be asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical sign is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (hâ†‘), that is also related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, a condition associated with the promoter polymorphism of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to underline (as is usually done by DNA molecular analysis) to detect and to clarify the genetic deficiency that is the reason of the disorder in question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, different techniques were applied to analyse a family of four individuals presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>: bilirubinic dosage, electrophoresis and enzymatic activity dosage of G6PD; molecular analysis of the UGT1A promoter to detect a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (TA) insertion, that causes the [A(TA)7TAA] mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that in certain cases, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is not only associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e>, but may be caused by the co-presence of a mutation in the UGTA1 promoter related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As being affected by these two conditions predisposes to adverse effects towards certain drug treatments, it is advisable to study the UGTA1 gene before prescribing drugs for specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> or retroviral treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We emphasize that investigating both the UGT1A gene and G6PD activity is the most reliable way to make a correct differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
