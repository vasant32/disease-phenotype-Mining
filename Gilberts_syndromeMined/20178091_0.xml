<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> seems to be more common in patients with disorders from the schizophrenic spectrum than in other psychiatric patients or in the general population and has been linked to brain alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This spectrum however contains a number of diagnostic entities that might not share the same etiological and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 325 hospital admissions were analysed over a one-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found an association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychotic disorders</z:e> (ATPD) with total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level and rate of elevated total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> that was increased compared to paranoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">schizoaffective disorder</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and was higher than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant increased direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> might suggest that reduced UGT activity, causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in the general population, is not the reason for elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in ATPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The difference between ATPD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">schizoaffective disorder</z:e> might be due to disorder severity, aetiology, or environmental factors that influence enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
