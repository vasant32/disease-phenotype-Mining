<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> diglucuronide (BDG) was present at lower levels, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monoglucuronide (BMG) and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were present at higher levels in GS and C-N II compared with NV, which is consistent with decreased hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyltransferase activity (BGTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of biliary BDG was higher in Wistar-Kyoto rats and lower in heterozygous (Jj) Gunn rats than in SD and Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hepatic BGTA level in heterozygous (Jj) Gunn rats was decreased to 60% of that in Wistar rats, in accordance with decreased biliary BDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, BGTA in Wistar-Kyoto rats whose biliary BDG level was high, was not different from that of Wistar and SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a correlation between BGTA and biliary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> fractions may not exist on some occasions </plain></SENT>
