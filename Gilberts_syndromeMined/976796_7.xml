<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, one was convalescing from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, and the other two had no detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001392'>liver abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measured indices of ICG metabolism indicated a marked reduction in the hepatic uptake, storage capacity, biliary transport maximum, and an increased reflux into plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies on the binding of ICG by plasma proteins failed to demonstrate any difference from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the primary defect seems to be in the transport of ICG by the hepatocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship of the defect in ICG metabolism to other constitutional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemias</z:e> is not clear, it is possible that the defect in these patients is a constitutional one involving some steps in the hepatic disposal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
