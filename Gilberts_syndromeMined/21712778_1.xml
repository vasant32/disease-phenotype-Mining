<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a new electrophoretic method, which enables to analyze up to 12 lipoprotein subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile is characterized by the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>), intermediate density <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> (IDL) and the presence of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of LDL1 and LDL2 subpopulations, as well as <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> is considered as protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Molecular - genetic examination of Gilbert\'s syndrome using fragment analysis method was carried out in collaboration with the Centre for Medical Genetics, University Hospital in Bratislava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in plasma were analyzed from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters by means of enzymatic CHOD-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> method, Roche Diagnostics, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical parameters - <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (total, conjugated and unconjugated), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma glutamyl</z:chebi> transpeptidase (GMT), (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), TSH, FT3, fT4 (Siemens) were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and their subfractions were examined using Lipoprint <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> System Quantimetrix, CA, USA (12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significantly higher levels of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the control group, probands had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, IDL cholesterol level, and small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels compared to the group with Gilbert\'s syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> had significantly lower presence of atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> spectrum than probands in control group (5% vs. 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found significantly negative correlation between serum unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> 3-7 (r = - 0.594, p &lt;0.01), as well as between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r = -0.540, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> 1-2 concentration correlated significantly positively (r = 0.451, p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> spectrum is determined by the particular representation of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Atherogenic spectrum was presented significantly less in patients with Gilbert\'s syndrome compared with the control group (5% vs. 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our study, we have not followed the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or other manifestations of atherosclerotic arteries disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, we found the inverse relationship of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and atherogenic small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We found out that the protective antiatherogenic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> is potentiated by low occurence of strongly atherogenic small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and persons with byperbilirubionemia (in our case represented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>), could be protected against the development of atheroscleosis </plain></SENT>
