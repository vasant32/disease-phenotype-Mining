<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The A(TA)nTAA region in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene was analysed in 20 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">G6PD deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these children had the African type variant (G6PDA-) and 6 had different variants (G6PDNara, G6PDGuadalajara, G6PDDurham, G6PDTomah, G6PDAveiro e G6PDNashville) related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonspherocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> (CNSHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The existence of a positive history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, as well as its severity was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was increased in this group of children (90%) and was not associated with abnormal alleles of the UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to assess the influence of abnormal alleles in the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003265'>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these abnormal alleles did not account for the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in children who presented variants related to CNSHA, since 5 were treated with an exchange transfusion and none presented abnormal alleles </plain></SENT>
