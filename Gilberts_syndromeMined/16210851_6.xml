<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> is caused by defects in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations differ among different populations and many of them have been found to be genetic risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the frequencies of the following mutations in the UGT1A1 gene: A(TA)7TAA (the most common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> in Caucasians), G71R (more common in the Japanese and Taiwanese population), and G493R (described in a homozygous Malay woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e> type 2) in a group of Malaysian babies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GeneScan fragment analysis was used to detect the A(TA)7TAA variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening of both G71R and G493R was performed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen out of fifty-five neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (25%) carried the A(TA)7TAA mutation (10 heterozygous, 4 homozygous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven out of fifty controls (14%) carried this mutation (6 heterozygous, 1 homozygous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and control patients were 16 and 8%, respectively (p=0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterozygosity for the G71R mutation was almost equal among both groups (5.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> patients and 6.0% for controls; p=0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One subject (1.8%) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> group and none of the controls were heterozygous for the G493R mutation (p=0.476) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The A(TA)7TAA seems more common than the G71R and G493R mutations in the Malaysian population </plain></SENT>
