<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied some aspects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> metabolism in 25 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and 25 control subjects in order to assess whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> are affected in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured serum cholic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> conjugates fasting and postprandially, the plasma disappearance of intravenously injected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23220">cholyl</z:chebi>[1-14C]glycine, 14CO2 in breath, and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> in stools after oral administration of the same isotope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean serum fasting level of conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> was significantly reduced in hyperbilirubinemic patients (p less than 0.01) in comparison with the controls, while the postprandial elevation was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23220">cholyl</z:chebi>[1-14C]glycine hepatic uptake was faster in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, but no significant difference was found as far as 14CO2 in breath and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> in stools were concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional in vitro studies showed that increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations displace <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17687">glycocholic acid</z:chebi> and, to a lesser extent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36274">glycochenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> from their binding to albumin, the affinity constant of the latter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> being 30 times greater than that of the former one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This competition between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> explains the faster hepatic uptake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> conjugates and hence their lower serum levels in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, low levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> conjugates, together with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> conjugate levels, discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> from other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
