<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proposita and her mother showed (TA)7/(TA)8 genotype, while her father and sister were (TA)6/(TA)7, but only the proposita showed clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report supports that the (TA)7 and (TA)8 are necessary, but not enough to explain the features of GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are probably additional genetic variations ie, the presence of "modifier" genes or one can speculate that an oligogenetic trait can contribute to the expression of the final phenotype </plain></SENT>
