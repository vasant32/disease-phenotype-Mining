<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic deficiency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyl transferase (GT) occurs in 5 to 7% of the population (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crigler-Najjar syndrome</z:e>) and this could predispose such people to acetaminophen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was evaluated in the homozygous Gunn rat, which is similarly deficient in GT, and the heterozygous Gunn rat, which has intermediary GT activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen, 1 g/kg, was administered by gavage to animals 6 and 11 weeks of age, and age-matched Wistar rats as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hepatic and renal cellular damage were assessed by respective increases in the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase and the blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen concentration, and confirmed by histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen and metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to Wistar controls, Gunn rats demonstrated up to a 110-fold greater hepatotoxic response to acetaminophen, with significantly lower production of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> conjugate and higher plasma concentrations of acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated acetaminophen concentrations correlated positively with both increased production of the acetaminophen-cysteine conjugate, reflecting bioactivation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older Gunn but not Wistar rats showed up to 26-fold more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> compared to their younger counterparts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a genetic deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> GT can be an important determinant of acetaminophen bioactivation and toxicity </plain></SENT>
