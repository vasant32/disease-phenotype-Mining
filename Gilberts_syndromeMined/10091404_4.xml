<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> present in approximately 30% of neonates affected by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an unsolved problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e>, the most common defect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation, on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> of these neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and two neonates affected by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were enrolled in this study: 56 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and 46 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the A(TA)nTAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT1A gene was performed by means of PCR, followed by separation on 6% denaturing polycrylamide gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the three different genotypes of the A(TA)nTAA motif was similar in the study and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated no difference in the percentage of homozygotes for the UGT1A (TA)7 variant associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> does not account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> occurring in some neonates with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> is not the major event in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
