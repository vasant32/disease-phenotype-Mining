<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One form of this of this enzyme, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1, is inducible by numerous agents which promote <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and is now known to provide important <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> protection, as demonstrated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of free radical-mediated pathogenesis, and suggested by epidemiology observing favorable health outcomes in individuals carrying high-expression alleles of the HO-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> impact of HO-1 appears to be mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, generated rapidly from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> by ubiquitously expressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> reductase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> efficiently scavenges a wide range of physiological oxidants by electron donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the process, it is often reconverted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi>, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> reductase quickly regenerates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, thereby greatly boosting its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is also suggestive evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> inhibits the activity or activation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is associated with reduced risk for atherogenic disease in epidemiological studies, and more limited data show an inverse correlation between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Feasible strategies for boosting serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels may include administration of HO-1 inducers, supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi>, and administration of drugs which decrease the efficiency of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The well-tolerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35841">uricosuric drug</z:chebi> probenecid achieves non-competitive inhibition of hepatic glucuronidation reactions by inhibiting the transport of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> into endoplasmic reticulum; probenecid therapy is included in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, and presumably could be used to induce an ''iatrogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e>'' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other drugs, such as rifampin, can raise serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> through competitive inhibition of hepatocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> uptake--although unfortunately rifampin is not as safe as probenecid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measures which can safely achieve moderate serum elevations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may prove to have value in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of disorders in which oxidants play a prominent pathogenic role, including many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and inflammatory syndromes </plain></SENT>
