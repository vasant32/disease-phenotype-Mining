<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the promoter as well as in the coding region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) have been found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in our population and correlation of these mutations to fasting serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> remain to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied polymerase chain reaction-based direct-sequencing assays to examine mutations in UGT1A1 gene in 20 unrelated Gilbert's patients and in a family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied three mutations that were previously reported to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> (i.e., the TATAA-box mutation, Gly71Arg, and Pro229Gln) in 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 16, five, and six were found to have the TATAA-box, Gly71Arg and Pro229Gln mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had simultaneous mutations both in the TATAA box and in the coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients with Pro229Gln also had the TATAA-box mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Localization of Pro229Gln on the allele containing the TATAA-box mutation was demonstrated in a family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients simultaneously heterozygous for both the TATAA-box mutation and Gly71Arg usually had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels similar to those found in the patients homozygous for the TATAA-box mutation, but usually higher than those found in the patients heterozygous for the TATAA-box mutation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, concurrence of Pro229Gln in patients with TATAA-box mutation or with Gly71Arg did not significantly affect serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TATAA-box mutation and Gly71Arg are the major causes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concurrence of mutations of Gly71Arg and TATAA-box usually exerts a synergistic effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pro229Gln, which is regularly linked to the TATAA-box mutation, may not have a significant effect on serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
