<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> characterized by intermittent and non-hemolytic elevation of indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels due to the deficiency of the enzyme <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronyl transferase in the liver and many prospective studies found an inverse relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and cardiovascular events in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels and arterial stiffness parameters in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 53 cases, consisting of 26 patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and 27 healthy control subjects, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels, other routine blood chemistry, and arterial stiffness measurements were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean ages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> and the control group were 31.5 ± 9.7 and 36.8 ± 11.1 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PWV measurements were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert syndrome</z:e> patients (6.68 and 7.3 m/s in patients and controls; respectively) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In correlation analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients, PWV had a significant correlation with total and indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (r = -0.370, P = .009/r = -0.495, P = .003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients have lower PWV measurements compared to healthy subjects, and the total and indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels are also associated with PWV measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may indicate the decreased atherosclerotic disease incidence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
