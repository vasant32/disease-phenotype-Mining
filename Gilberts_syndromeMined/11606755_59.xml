<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008282'>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> develops in up to 25% of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi>, prompting drug discontinuation and further clinical evaluation in some instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that this side-effect is due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi>-mediated impairment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity and would be most pronounced in individuals with reduced hepatic enzyme levels, as occurs in approximately 10% of the population manifesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested in vitro, in the Gunn rat model of UGT deficiency, and in HIV-infected patients with and without the Gilbert's polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">Indinavir</z:chebi> was found to competitively inhibit UGT enzymatic activity (K(I) = 183 microM) while concomitantly inducing hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> UGT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi> increased plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and heterozygous Gunn rats, the mean rise was significantly greater in the latter group of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> increased by a mean of 0.34 mg/dl in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi>-treated HIV patients lacking the Gilbert's polymorphism versus 1.45 mg/dl in those who were either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas saquinavir also competitively inhibits UGT activity, this drug has not been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, most likely because of the higher K(I) (360 microM) and substantially lower therapeutic levels as compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that elevations in serum-unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44032">indinavir</z:chebi> treatment result from direct inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>-conjugating activity </plain></SENT>
