<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every twentieth person is affected in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 1307 people in MH EVI at expedient operated specialist' workplaces, where we investigate work capacity evaluation in the first three months of 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimating the laboratory results, the frequent increases of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> plasma levels were remarkable, which we observed in 117 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our control examinations pointed out that in 57 cases of the 117 the increase was caused by the accumulation of indirect unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In theses cases, aimed examinations indicated neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> nor any disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>increased hemolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lack of other diagnostic sign, the abnormal value led to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In respect of physical loading capacity, there is no united stand in the judging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore we made a comparison between the results of 57 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert-syndrome</z:e> and of 57 healthy controls with the same age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We made this examination in our institute, at the department which investigates the fitness for physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We didn't notice any difference between the two groups' loading capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In consequence of our study and of other observations till now, we should re-interpret the question of restriction in the field of work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our observations refer to a representative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We hope this study will help in diagnostic considerations and in the correct general estimation of the importance of this metabolic anomaly </plain></SENT>
