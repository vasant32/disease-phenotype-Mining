<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> as a provocative test for the diagnosis of GS was evaluated and compared with a fasting test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with GS, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and 20 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> and fasting tests were applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the fasting test, the subjects were given a 400 calorie/day diet for 24 hours; in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> test, unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels was measured before and four hours after taking 600 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both tests achieved a significant increase in mean unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in patients with GS but not in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> test in the diagnosis of GS were comparable with the fasting test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, both tests caused a significant increase in unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in nearly half the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> test may be used in the diagnosis of suspected GS instead of a fasting test, as it is simpler and more practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, its specificity for GS is not sufficient, because it also causes an increase in unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
