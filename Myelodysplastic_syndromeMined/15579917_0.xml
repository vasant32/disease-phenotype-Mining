<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 21 females and 7 males, median age 60 yr (range 18-84 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had circulating blasts, and 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 8 RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and 6 RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent of the 27 patients who were karyotyped had an abnormal clone, but none of them had -7/7q- or complex cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 13 patients tested had abnormal (i.e., "leukemic") in vitro growth of GM progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 5 yr following the diagnosis, none of the 28 patients progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with an initial diagnosis of RA showed progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 5 yr, 23 of the 28 long-term survivors had stable disease (follow-up period ranged from 64 to 216 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (113 mo after diagnosis) and another to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> (80 mo after diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight asymptomatic patients were not treated and 12 patients received only supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for 6 of 8 treated patients who responded to low-dose Ara-C, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, or immunosuppressive treatment, prolonged survival seemed to result mainly from the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Except for Valensia score (p=0.033), other scoring systems (Bournemouth, Dusseldorf, Lille, and IPSS score) proved of relatively limited value in differentiating between intermediate (2-5 yr) and long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
