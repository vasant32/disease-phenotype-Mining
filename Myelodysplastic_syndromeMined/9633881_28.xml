<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A commercially available ELISA and EDTA-plasma samples were used for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma TPO concentration in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and umbilical cord blood were 52 +/- 12 pg/ml and 66 +/- 12 pg/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values in patients with SAA and chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> were 1514 +/- 336 pg/ml and 1950 +/- 1684 pg/ml, respectively, and the TPO concentration, measured sequentially after myeloablative chemotherapy and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation, was inversely related to the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the plasma TPO recorded in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (64 +/- 20 pg/ml) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (68 +/- 23 pg/ml) were only slightly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TPO levels were significantly elevated in patients in which bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelets in circulation were markedly reduced, whereas TPO levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, and only slightly increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These latter patients displayed a preserved number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data support the suggestion that megakaryocyte mass affects the plasma TPO concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In thrombocytopenic patients a substantially increased plasma TPO implies deficient megakaryocyte numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, TPO measurements do not distinguish between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to dysmegakaryopoiesis, as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
