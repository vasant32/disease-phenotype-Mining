<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs from bone marrow samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were isolated, cultured and expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs were morphologically analyzed and their immunophenotype were determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various amounts of MSCs were added into one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were tested for their ability to suppress in vitro proliferation of autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 3 x 10(3 - 1) x 10(5) MSCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients could inhibit autologuous PBLs proliferation to (66.9 +/- 20.1)% - (30.2 +/- 5.9)% of maximal response, as well as inhibit allogeneic PBLs proliferation to (56.6 +/- 14.7)% - (20.5% +/- 9.7)% of maximal response, as compared with inhibitory ability of MSCs from healthy donors, there was no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded MSCs from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> also possess immunosuppressive activity </plain></SENT>
