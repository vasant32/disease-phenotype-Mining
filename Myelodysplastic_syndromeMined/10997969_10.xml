<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRP1 expression was investigated by immunocytochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) and by flow cytometry using MRPm6 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efflux test using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi>-AM (CAM) +/- probenecid to evaluate MRP1 activity was performed in ten of the 56 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRP1 expression was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (70% vs. 36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efflux test using CAM was positive in three out of the ten patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were in agreement with expression of MRP1 in six cases, and were discordant in four cases (1 MRP-/CAM+, 3 MRP+/CAM-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between MRP1 expression and P-gp, lung resistance-associated protein (LRP) or CD34 expression, although there was a trend for more frequent MRP1 expression in P-gp-positive cases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As for P-gp, discordant expression/function of MRP1 could be found in some cases, suggesting the existence of non-functional transport proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
