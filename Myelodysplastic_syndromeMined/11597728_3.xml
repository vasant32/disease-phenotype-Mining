<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We separated RAEBt patients based on these two criteria and compared hematologic and clinical relevance to assess the reasonable basis for the new classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> RAEBt patients showing peripheral blood (PB) blasts of &gt; or =5% were re-classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> by the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This subset of RAEBt patients had lower percentages of bone marrow (BM) blasts, and notably they showed frequent complex cytogenetic abnormalities, including -5/5q- and/or -7/7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the RAEBt patients of this group had shorter survivals compared to RAEBt patients with BM blasts between 20 and 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next assessed hematologic and clinical relevance between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and RAEBt patients with PB blasts of &gt; or =5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for the percentage of blasts in the PB (P=0.0037) and BM (P=0.0073), there was no significant difference in hematologic or clinical features between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients with BM blasts of &gt; or =11% and RAEBt patients with PB blasts of &gt; or =5% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although it is still controversial whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with BM blasts 20% or more should be considered as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, the utilization of the '<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 2000 classification' might be useful to designate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients diagnosed based on the percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
