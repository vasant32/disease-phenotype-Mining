<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the three genes was studied in 81 patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) by methylation-specific PCR, and p15 methylation additionally by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 55 patients disclosed p15 methylation, five patients showed p16 methylation, whereas p14 methylation was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation of p15 was closely associated with deletion or loss of chromosome arm 7q (P=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the p15 methylation frequency and the p15 methylation density both increased significantly by stage (P=0.004 and 0.0002), and p15 methylation frequency increased with an increasing percentage of myeloblasts in the bone marrow (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a two-variable Cox model including the percentage of myeloblasts, p15 methylation was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of p15 was less common in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> of subtype M5 than in other FAB subtypes (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation of p15 was unrelated to type of previous therapy, to latent period from start of therapy, to platelet count, and to p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of p15 and deletion of genes on chromosome arm 7q possibly cooperate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
