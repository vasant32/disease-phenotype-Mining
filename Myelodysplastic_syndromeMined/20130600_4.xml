<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)), lenalidomide exerts hematological and cytogenetic effects, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the in vitro effects of lenalidomide on an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cell line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L, which carries del(5q) and complex chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells was specifically suppressed mainly by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and in addition, multinucleated cells were frequently formed and finally died out in the presence of lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-lapse microscopic observation and the DNA ploidy analysis revealed that lenalidomide does not affect DNA synthesis but inhibits cytokinesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profile showed decreased expression of M phase-related genes such as non-muscle myosin heavy-chain 10, polo-like kinase 1, aurora kinase B, citron kinase and kinesin family member 20A(KIF20A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, KIF20A is located at 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data contribute to the understanding of action mechanisms of lenalidomide on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q) and complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
