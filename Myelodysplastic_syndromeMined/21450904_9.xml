<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine whether the same held true for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 793 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> patients seen at our institution, 62 displayed an unfavorable karyotype by way of complex karyotype (n = 41) or sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (41%) of the 41 patients with complex karyotype were classified as having an MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 6, 24, and 20 months in patients with MK, complex karyotype without <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp>, and sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, respectively (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding 2-year leukemic transformation rates were 29.4%, 8.3%, and 0 (P &lt; .0001); hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 6.9 (1.3-37.3) and 14.8 (1.7-130.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognostic relevance of MK was not accounted for by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MK in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> is associated with extremely poor overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival </plain></SENT>
