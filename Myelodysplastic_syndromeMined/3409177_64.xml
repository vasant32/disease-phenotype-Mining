<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were found to have a second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e>, 19 of which involved the myeloid cells (ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e>, five <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>), and three of which involved the lymphoid cells (three malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chromosome analysis of the bone marrow revealed abnormalities characteristic of neoplastic myeloid disorders in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> was 28% compared with 61% for other SMCD patients (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> differed significantly from other SMCD patients in that they were about 7 years older (P = 0.039), and they presented more commonly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P less than 0.001) and constitutional symptoms (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients also had less frequent skin symptoms (P = 0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> pigmentosa (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By definition, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> had a greater percent of hematopoiesis (P less than 0.001) and decreased fat cells (P = 0.011) on bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model demonstrated that the following independent variables were associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>: low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P = 0.001), the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> (P = 0.016), high leukocyte count (P = 0.021), and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002756'>pathologic fractures</z:hpo> (P = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequent coexistence of SMCD with dysplastic and neoplastic disorders of myeloid cells is consistent with the concept that SMCD itself is a disorder of myeloid cells and that the mast cell may be myeloid in origin </plain></SENT>
