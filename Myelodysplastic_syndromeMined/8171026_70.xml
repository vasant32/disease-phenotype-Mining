<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AML1 was identified by its involvement in the t(8;21)(q22;q22) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the consistent identification of fusion transcripts between AML1 and EAP or between AML1 and previously unidentified sequences that we named MDS1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated sequences) in the leukemic cells of four patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had a t(3;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have identified a third chimeric transcript, AML1/EVI1, in one of the therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis established the order of the genes as EAP, the most telomeric, and EVI1, the most centromeric, gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that translocations could involve multiple genes and affect gene expression over long distances </plain></SENT>
