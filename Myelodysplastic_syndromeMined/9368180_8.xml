<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preliminary studies, OL(1)p53, a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide directed against p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, decreased the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cells in vitro, suggesting a possible role for OL(1)p53 in purging bone marrow harvests of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate that OL(1)p53 was nontoxic to hematopoietic progenitor cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells were incubated with 10 microM OL(1)p53 for 36 h, and hematopoietic progenitor cell survival was determined by in vitro colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OL(1)p53 had no toxic effect on the growth of either myeloid (CFU-GM) or erythroid (BFU-E) progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OL(1)p53 was then used to ex vivo purge bone marrow harvests from nine patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells were incubated with 10 microM OL(1)p53 for 36 h before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median times posttransplantation for the patient to recover an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet transfusion independence were 30 days and 56 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of bone marrow cells with OL(1)p53 had no detrimental effect on the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and transplantation of autologous bone marrow cells treated with the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, OL(1)p53, resulted in successful recovery of circulating neutrophils following high-dose therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data show that OL(1)p53 can be used safely to purge autologous bone marrow harvests from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
