<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerical abnormalities of chromosome 7 were detected by using fluorescence labeled in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure with a centromere-specific probe in four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these results with classical cytogenetic (CC) data demonstrated a good correlation between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH confirmed the finding of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who demonstrated this abnormality by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients who did not show <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 by CC were unexpectedly found to contain this abnormality in 39.8% and 17% cells when examined by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given that our modified FISH method consistently yielded &gt; 96% hybridization efficiency, these findings constitute an unexpected but real presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in a substantial number of interphase cells that had remained undetected by classical karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a number of maturing myeloid cells including granulocytes also demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 by FISH, thereby confirming the ability of malignant cells to undergo differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FISH constitutes a highly sophisticated molecular technique which can be extremely useful in select cases for detecting 'masked <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7' as well as helping to determine the lineage of terminally mature cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, thereby providing a handle on the effects of cytokines or chemotherapy on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vs leukemic clones </plain></SENT>
