<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The karyotype analysis was performed in 178 AML using the short-term culture of bone marrow cell and G-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 178 patients, 171 had enough metaphases for analysis and 128 (74.9%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), with 25 (92.6%) patients carrying clonal karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 144 patients of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 103 (71.5%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of abnormal clonal karyotype was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than that of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 171 patients, 41 (24.0%) were in favorable risk group, 80(46.8%) in intermediate risk group and 50 (29.2%) in adverse risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>t(15;17) was the most common chromosomal aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority intermediate risk chromosomal aberration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common cytogenetic abnormality among adverse group was a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse cytogenetic aberrations, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, frequently occurred in conjunction with one another as part of a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Totally 75 patients were 60 years or older, among them, 16.0% were in favorable risk group, 48.0% in intermediate risk group and 36.0% in adverse risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 96 younger patients, 30.2% were in favorable risk group, 45.8% in intermediate risk group and 24.0% in adverse risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of favorable risk chromosomal aberration was lower in elder patients than in younger (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of adverse risk chromosomal aberration and the rate of monosomal karyotype were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common favorable, intermediate and adverse chromosomal aberrations were t(15;17), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and complex karyotype respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was poor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and elder <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
