<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to assess fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbF) concentration and to investigate correlations with organomegaly and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> and with the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and blood transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> were investigated by ferrokinetics using 59Fe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of marrow sideroblasts was assessed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased values of HbF were found to occur both in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, although a higher incidence and higher concentrations were evident in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant increases in HbF concentration were found when there was accompanying organomegaly, as compared to patients without this feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average HbF concentration in both groups of patients under study was twice as high in cases with as in those without marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased HbF levels appear to correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbF concentration did not correlate with the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or with requirement for blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
