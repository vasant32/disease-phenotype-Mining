<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Which of these indexes best predict survival is unknown yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 286 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HCT-CI and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> scores required grading according to pre-transplant pulmonary function tests (PFTs), which were lacking for some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We thus designed a reduced HCT-CI and an adjusted <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>, without results of PFTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using CCI, 25% of patients had indexes of 1 or more; median reduced HCT-CI score was 1; median adjusted <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> score was 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discriminative properties of the three CIs were rather low in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of patients and transplant characteristics between our and Seattle group's cohorts, however, revealed significant differences in more children, in more cord blood HSCT and in HSCT for Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in St Louis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, multivariate analysis of scoring items revealed that age, matched unrelated or mismatched donor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> were associated with NRM in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Translating use for patient's counseling or decision to proceed to transplant of these CIs will need prospective studies in a large independent cohort </plain></SENT>
