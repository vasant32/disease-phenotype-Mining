<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mylotarg (Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Davids, PA) is the brand name for a calicheamicin-conjugated humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CMA-676) and has been approved recently for the treatment of a subset of elderly patients who have relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mylotarg is associated with an incidence of approximately 20% Grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> and liver transaminitis in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hepatic venoocclusive disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>) has been reported in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT) after Mylotarg therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outside of the SCT setting, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> has been associated very rarely with cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors assessed the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> in 119 patients who were receiving Mylotarg-containing non-SCT regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> was diagnosed through the use of standard Seattle and Baltimore criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cohort of 119 (61 previously untreated, 58 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (92 patients), advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (25 patients), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast phase</z:e> (2 patients), received Mylotarg-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (12%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> was supported by histology in 2 patients and radiologic studies in a further 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five (36%) of 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> had received no prior antileukemic cytotoxic therapy, including 2 patients who received single-agent Mylotarg therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mylotarg was shown to be associated with the development of potentially fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who had not received SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> occurred when Mylotarg was used either as a single agent or when it was given with other cytotoxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> occurred in Mylotarg-treated patients who had received no prior cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The current study concluded that risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> should be assessed when considering Mylotarg therapy, and that attempts to avoid and treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> are warranted in patients who receive Mylotarg therapy </plain></SENT>
