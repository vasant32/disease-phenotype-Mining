<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the WHO proposal, to assess the role of the main prognostic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) classified into WHO subgroups, and to estimate mortality (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) and life expectancy in these groups as a basis for clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred sixty-seven patients who were diagnosed as having de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at the Division of Hematology, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), between 1992 and 2002, were evaluated retrospectively for clinical and hematologic features at diagnosis, overall survival (OS), and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in survival were noted between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, RA with excess blasts, type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of demographic factors on OS was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without excess blasts (age, P = .001; sex, P = .006), as in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality of RA patients 70 years or older did not differ significantly from that of the general population (SMR, 1.62; P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics was the only International Prognostic Scoring System variable showing a prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classified into WHO subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfusion-dependent patients had a significantly shorter survival than patients who did not require transfusions (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Developing a secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> significantly affected the survival of transfusion-dependent patients (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that the WHO classification of MDSs has a relevant prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This classification, along with cytogenetics, might be useful in decisions regarding transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated erythroid lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> identifies a subset of truly low-risk patients, for whom a conservative approach is advisable </plain></SENT>
