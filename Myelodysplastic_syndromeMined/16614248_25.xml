<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune inhibition can result from cytotoxic T cell (CTL) attack against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis or reflect immune surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used clonally unique T-cell receptor (TCR) variable beta-chain (VB) CDR3 regions as markers of pathogenic CTL responses and show that while marrow failure syndromes are characterized by polyclonal expansions, overexpanded clones exist in these diseases and can serve as investigative tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the applicability of clonotypic assays, we developed rational molecular methods for the detection of immunodominant clonotypes in blood and in historic marrow biopsies of 35 AA, 37 MDS, and 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) patients, in whom specific CDR3 sequences and clonal sizes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTL expansions were detected in 81% and 97% of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 81 immunodominant signature clonotypes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the sequence of immunodominant CDR3 clonotypes, we designed quantitative assays for monitoring corresponding clones, including clonotypic Taqman polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and clonotype-specific sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between clonality and disease severity but in patients treated with immunosuppression, truly pathogenic clones were identified based on the decline that paralleled hematologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunodominant clonotypes associated with marrow failure may be used to monitor immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
