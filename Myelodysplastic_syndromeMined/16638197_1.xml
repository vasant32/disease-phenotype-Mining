<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MSC from bone marrow samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were isolated, cultured and expanded, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype of MSC were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of SDF-1 and internal reference GAPDH in MSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) method and were compared with expression levels of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression levels of SDF-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly different from those in healthy donors (1.53 +/- 0.92 vs 5.51 +/- 0.99) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 gene expression levels in bone marrow MSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than that in MSC derived from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the abnormal expression of SDF-1 gene in MSC may influence the regulation of hematopoiesis of the bone marrow microenvironment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and it is worthy of further investigation for new clue on etiological mechanism and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
