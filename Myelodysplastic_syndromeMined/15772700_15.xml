<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both conventional chimerism analysis (CCA) and lineage-specific chimerism analysis (LCA) have potential pitfalls as diagnostic means for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (aHCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study examines the results of both methods in order to determine how predictive consecutive evaluations were, with respect to the risk that the patient would relapse during post-transplant follow-up and with respect to responsiveness to immunomodulatory treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 168 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 137) and myelo dysplastic syndrome (n = 31) were investigated with CCA and LCA at mean intervals of 24 days (range: 11-116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up after myeloablative aHCT was 22 months (range: 4-49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 168 patients, 65 experienced a clinical relapse after aHCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CCA and LCA were comparatively sensitive and specific for relapse at the intervals of chimerism testing employed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 32 patients, 10 who were offered donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) treatment for increasing (n = 29) or stable (n = 3) mixed chimerism (MC) achieved at least transitory CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observation that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with increasing MC relapsed despite DLI treatment (54%) or withdrawal of immune suppression (24%) indicates that novel strategies to deal with rapidly evolving relapse in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, such as shortening of chimerism monitoring intervals, need to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
