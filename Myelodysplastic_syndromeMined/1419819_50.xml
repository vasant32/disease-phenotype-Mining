<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although most haematologists perceive a rising prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), reliable epidemiological data on these disorders are largely lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow register of the University of Düsseldorf allowed us to assess among other epidemiological features the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which was compared to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 18,416 different patients registered between 1975 and 1990, 584 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (3.2%) and 506 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (2.8%) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the study period, the percentage of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> rose from 1.3% to 4.5%, while there was no upward trend for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing bone marrow biopsy, the proportion of those over 60 years of age increased from 41.9% in 1975 to 54.1% in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a strong correlation between the proportion of elderly patients and the relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (5.3%) were classified as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> because of previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or irradiation for a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were identified in whom occupational exposure to organic solvents could not be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For calculating age-specific incidence rates, the analysis was confined to the town district of Düsseldorf (575,000 inhabitants), because exact demographical data were available for this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the last quinquennium of the study period (1986-90), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were more frequent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in the age group 50-70 years (4.9 v 1.8/100,000/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients over 70, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was more than 3 times that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (22.8 v 6.7/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this group, men had a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (33.9/100,000) than women (18/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Crude annual incidence (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups) was also higher for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (4.1/100,000) than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (2.1/100,000) in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are relatively common haematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rising incidence in recent years is probably not due to changes in aetiological factors, but may reflect increased awareness on the part of physicians and extended use of diagnostic procedures in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
