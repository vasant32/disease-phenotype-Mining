<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the presence of activated ras protooncogenes has been reported to be a negative prognostic factor in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined 49 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> for mutations in the first exon of K-ras using the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in codon 12 or 13 of K-ras were detected in 6 of 49 cases (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These six cases consisted of five endometrioid <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinomas</z:hpo>, each of which had a mutation in codon 12, and one case of clear cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which had a mutation in codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study the presence of mutations in K-ras appeared to be an unfavorable prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of six patients with the mutation died during follow-up, while only 7% of the 43 patients without K-ras mutations expired during this same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model, K-ras activation appeared to be an independent risk factor when compared with clinical stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that K-ras protooncogene activation plays an important role in determining the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
