<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B/T cell ratio in myelodysplastic patients (n = 11) was significantly higher than in controls (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients had a reduction in total T-cell (OKT3+) frequency and in T-cell subset (OKT4+/OKT8+) ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response of patients' cells to both pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was reduced, but patients' B cells responded normally to stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of IgG and IgM detected in 7-day culture supernatants of PWM-stimulated patient and control cells were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> B-cell and immunoregulatory T-cell functions were subsequently demonstrated in allogeneic co-culture combinations of enriched T and B cells from patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data presented indicate that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>frequent infections</z:hpo> of myelodysplastic patients are not causally related to impaired humoral mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data also favor the possibility that the stem cell disorder in these syndromes is functionally expressed at a subsequent stage to the lymphoid differentiation pathway </plain></SENT>
