<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Covariates were tested using the forward addition, Objective Function (OF) cut-off of 3.84, followed by the backward elimination (OF cut-off 10.88) steps in NONMEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These covariates included demographics, mucositis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) or H(2)-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> usage and baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> or baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase (GGT) levels &gt; or =2 x upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (ULN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A correlation between posaconazole PK and the occurrence of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (IFI) was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were demonstrated between posaconazole PK and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> intake, race, and baseline GGT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These covariates did not predominate in patients who developed IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This analysis provides information regarding the correlation of patient covariates with posaconazole exposures estimated in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis agree with previously reported analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, because of the successful prophylaxis and the low number of posaconazole-treated patients with IFI proven or probable (IFIPP), the absence of a statistically significant relationship between IFIPP and exposure may not mean this relationship does not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of several efficacy trials or exploring alternate composite endpoints for efficacy may be needed to answer this question </plain></SENT>
