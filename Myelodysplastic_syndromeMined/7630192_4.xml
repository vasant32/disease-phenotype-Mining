<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) technique was used to examine the origin of the progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients with respectively, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> marker were studied both at presentation and during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At presentation, the in vitro cultured clusters of both cases appeared diploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite the abnormal growth patterns, the cultured progenitors could have been residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they could have originated from a preleukemic clone with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases abnormal BM and/or PB cells (less than 6%) were detected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> during remission, indicating partially or completely clonal remissions in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 10 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> marker was analyzed during myelodysplastic phase and after progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On both occasions, abnormally appearing clusters were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, only part of the clusters carried <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of a subclone characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 10 and an abnormally growing (pre)leukemic clone without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 10 may explain this observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 1 and 17 were respectively used as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> markers in two other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in vitro cultured clusters carried the numerical abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term liquid cultures of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were performed for 10-20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In both cases, no residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clonogenic cells could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the selective growth advantage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitor cells in long-term marrow cultures could not be demonstrated in these two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This paper illustrates the usefulness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> to study the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at the clonogenic level during preleukemic phase, active disease, remission, and under in vitro culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is a sensitive technique which allows individual analysis of large numbers of small aggregates and single cells in culture </plain></SENT>
