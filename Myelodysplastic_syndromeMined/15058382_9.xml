<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human SLC36A1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal amino acid transporter LYAAT1/PAT1, generates multiple alternative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, some of which encode truncated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SLC36A1 is expressed in numerous tissues, whereas expression of SLC36A2, which encodes the glycine transporter tramdorinl/PAT2, is most abundant in kidney and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of a third gene, SLC36A3, is restricted to testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse Slc36a2 also is expressed in bone and fat tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in human SLC36A2 exclude it as a candidate locus for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> that has been mapped to 5q31-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLC36A2 is a candidate gene for 5q-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, on the basis of its chromosomal location and its expression in bone </plain></SENT>
