<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred four patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera and a variable period of follow-up had one or more cytogenetic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities were found in 13% of untreated patients, in 56% of cases treated with radioactive <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>) or cytotoxic drugs, and in 85% of patients in which transformation of the disease had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom chromosome abnormalities found before treatment included +8, +9, 13q-, 20q-; their prognostic value is little, as they are often associated with longstanding, stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 5q- anomaly and the appearance of subclones in patients with an abnormal karyotype were found to be poor prognostic signs, as they are usually coincidental with evolution of the disease to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomally two patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first type resembles de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, in that the clinical and cytologic characteristics of the disorder are easily defined by FAB criteria and the chromosome changes compatible with the types usually found in those conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second type, assignment to a FAB morphologic subgroup was more difficult, myelodysplastic changes were often present, and the karyotype showed complex abnormalities frequently involving chromosomes #5 and #7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these features suggest the occurrence of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
