<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> is a lethal disease despite some responsiveness to systemic chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue is being utilized with increasing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis was undertaken to determine the outcome for such patients treated with intensive chemotherapy between 1989-1994, at the Hoag <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center in Newport Beach, CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 1989, only patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> who had failed more than two standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> chemotherapy regimens were considered eligible for such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received high-dose BCNU/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cisplatinum</z:chebi> chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After January 1990, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were eligible only if they had received limited prior chemotherapy and demonstrated responsiveness to induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beginning June 1990, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and thiotepa (MiTepa) followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue, then ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (ICE) chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-risk adjuvant patients were to receive one course of ICE followed by rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1/89-12/94, 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients underwent 65 intensive chemotherapy treatments followed by autologous stem cell rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 1989, three of the eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> died within 60 days because of therapy-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The longest failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) of these eight was 12.2 months, and the longest overall survival (OS) 20.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since 1/90, one physician has treated 24 patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, 17 of whom actually underwent two successive transplants with MiTepa/ICE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the latter group, median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> is 23.2 months; median OS is 39.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, but two patients died &gt; 60 days after initial transplant from therapy-related complications, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (5.2 months) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (30.5 months), while five died of progressive disease at 22.5, 32.8, 39.4, 46.3, and 51.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the 24 metastatic patients treated 1990-1994, 1-, 2-, and 3-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> rates are 86%, 40%, and 17%, respectively, while OS rates are 91%, 80%, and 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients treated in the adjuvant setting, only one has relapsed (9.8 months) with follow-up from 3-61 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modifications made in the program, including selection of patients responsive to induction chemotherapy, transfusion of peripheral blood stem cells, implementation of hematopoietic colony stimulating factors, and use of tandem intensive treatments has been associated with a low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> morbidity and encouraging survival rates </plain></SENT>
