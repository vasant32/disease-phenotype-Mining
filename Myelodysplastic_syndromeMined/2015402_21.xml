<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a CSF-1 radioimmunoassay, we surveyed concentrations of biologically active CSF-1 in the peripheral blood of 316 patients with malignant and premalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>; 75 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 106 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL; of low-, intermediate- and high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>), 46 Hodgkin's disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), and 3 monoclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178650" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gammopathy</z:e> of undetermined significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls were 64 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF-1 concentration was correlated with the type of disease, status of the disease, treatment status, and hematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF-1 concentration was significantly elevated in 83.5% of the patients with active disease, and for each active disease group it was significantly greater (P less than .0001) than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the high circulating CSF-1 concentration was not associated with a particular malignant phenotype or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype, but did correlate with the disease activity of both NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden in MM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of the CSF-1 level with total counts of monocytes or neutrophils in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cellular basis for the elevated circulating CSF-1 was not investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the results are consistent with the possibility that the premalignant or malignant cells themselves produce CSF-1 or regulate its production by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
