<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR method was used to detect the methylation status of FHIT gene promoter region in the DNA from plasma of 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> plus semis CAG therapy (among them, 1 case of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 3 cases progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that 3 cases were found to have an increased methylation in the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> plus semis CAG, increased methylation was reversed in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, 2 cases displayed clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that FHIT gene hypermethylation is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> has demethylating effect on the FHIT gene hypermethylation of plasma from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detecting the methylation status of FHIT gene in DNA from plasma may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> auxiliary diagnosis or prognosis </plain></SENT>
