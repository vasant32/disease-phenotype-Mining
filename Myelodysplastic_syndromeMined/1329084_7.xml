<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the effects of the site-selective cAMP analog 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP) on clonogenic growth of blast progenitors from 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and 3 patients affected by advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic blast progenitors undergo terminal divisions, giving rise to colonies in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The self-renewal capacity of blast progenitors is conversely reflected in a secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> assay after exponential growth of clonogenic cells in suspension cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples tested, 8-Cl-cAMP, at micromolar concentrations (0.1-50 microM), suppressed in a dose-dependent manner both primary colony formation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> and the recovery of clonogenic cells from suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, in the samples from the entire group of patients, 8-Cl-cAMP was more effective in inhibiting the self-renewing clonogenic cells than the terminally dividing blast cells (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in four out of six cases studied, 8-Cl-cAMP was able to induce a morphologic and/or immunophenotypic maturation of leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An evident reduction of RI levels in fresh leukemic cells after exposure to 8-Cl-cAMP was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showing that 8-Cl-cAMP is a powerful inhibitor of clonogenic growth of leukemic blast progenitors by primarily suppressing their self-renewal capacity indicate that this site-selective cAMP analog represents a promising biological agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> therapy in humans </plain></SENT>
