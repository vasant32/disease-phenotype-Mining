<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients who had cytogenetic analyses performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vincent's Hospital over a 6-year period were found to have an inversion abnormality of chromosome 16 (25 patients) or t(16;16) (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 16 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of M4Eo, while the other 10 patients had diagnoses of M2, M4, M5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>; six of these had abnormal eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, abnormal eosinophils were present in 22 of 26 patients (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had additional cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis, the commonest being +8 in 5, del(7q) in 4, and +21 in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients received chemotherapy and 20 (87%) achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the treated group was 188 weeks with a 61% 2-year and 45% 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in survival was observed between those patients with a diagnosis of M4Eo and those with other diagnoses suggesting that it is the abnormality of chromosome 16 which confers an improved prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional cytogenetic abnormalities present at diagnosis did not affect prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse was observed in only two patients (8%), thus indicating no increased incidence of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study supports the premise that a chromosome abnormality involving 16p13 and 16q22 defines a good prognosis subset of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> despite morphological variations </plain></SENT>
