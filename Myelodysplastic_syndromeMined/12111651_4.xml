<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A platelet kinetic study (PKS) is not indicated in the evaluation of adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients refractory to or relapsing after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, its appropriateness is considered uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively performed a PKS with (111)In oxine-labeled autologous platelets in 93 consecutive adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients failing steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 22 patients (24%) a primary condition accounting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was identified (17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients had significantly longer platelet circulating life span (P=0.0001), lower splenic platelet uptake (P=0.008) and higher liver platelet uptake (P=0.05) compared to 71 patients with confirmed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients with platelets persistently &lt;50 x 10(9)/L, splenectomy was considered in 48 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 23 (48%) it was prospectively excluded because of platelet life span &gt; or = 7 days (11 cases), no splenic platelet uptake together with high liver uptake (10 cases), or both conditions (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was successfully carried out in the other 25 patients, obtaining a response rate of 100% (22 complete responses; three partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent relapse occurred in six of 25 (24%) splenectomized patients after a median of three months (range 1-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PKS parameters were not able to predict post-splenectomy relapse, although relapsed patients had lower splenic/hepatic platelet uptake ratio (2.6 in relapsed vs 4.9 in persistently responsive patients; P=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> failing steroid therapy, some PKS parameters may be prospectively used to increase the short term success rate of splenectomy </plain></SENT>
