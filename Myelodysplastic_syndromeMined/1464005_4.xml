<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1987 we have used the combination of CYA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> for GVHD prophylaxis in 24 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the first 50 days post-transplantation, CYA dosage was adjusted to keep within a therapeutic range of 95-205 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a 60% reduction in CYA dosage by day 50 post-transplant compared to the original Seattle protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the low dosage of CYA administered, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was only 25% with no patient having greater than grade I GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There have been no leukaemic relapses in low risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that decreasing CYA dosage does not increase the incidence of GVHD but may reduce the risk of leukaemic relapse following allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
