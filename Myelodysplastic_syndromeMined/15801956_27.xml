<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of RASSF1A, SHP-1 and SOCS-1, negative regulators of RTK/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> signalling, has not been extensively investigated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study employed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) to determine if aberrant promotor methylation of RASSF1A, SHP-1 and SOCS-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 107), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 154) and juvenile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>, n = 5) were investigated, together with 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primers were located in the promotor region of each gene as well as within exon 2 of SOCS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of RASSF1A was found in five of 55 (9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, but not in any of 57 AML cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RASSF1A methylation was present in one case (20%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SHP-1 methylation was present in 13 of 121 (11%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases but was not found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SOCS-1 promoter methylation was present in eight of 74 (11%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients but was not seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations and RASSF1A and SOCS-1 methylation were mutually exclusive indicating that approximately 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases had a defect of the RTK/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> pathway and its negative regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, SOCS-1 exon 2 methylation may not be pathogenetically relevant, since it was detected in samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and did not correlate with promotor methylation </plain></SENT>
