<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the prognostic factors determining survival in 24 patients with GS using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by log rank tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated gender, age, location, GS antedating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, underlying disorders, treatment type and stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate for the patients with GS was 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients undergoing chemotherapy had a significantly longer survival time compared to those who did not (p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in the 5-year survival rate among the patients undergoing chemotherapy combined with radiation or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> had worse survival rates (p = 0.0028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis with biopsy and early chemotherapy can improve survival outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local radiation or surgery can improve symptoms but does not influence survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
