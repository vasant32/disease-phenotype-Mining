<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (120-180 mg/m(2)), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg p.o. or 6.4 mg/kg i.v.), and antithymocyte globulin ( n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> ( n=36) and a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> ( n=29) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil ( n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 55 years (range: 23-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reasons to perform a dose-reduced conditioning were reduced performance status ( n=14), age ( n=12), prior autologous ( n=5) or allogeneic ( n=1) transplantation, or prior/active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> ( n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses at transplantation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) ( n=8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) ( n=6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) ( n=13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) ( n=3), and sAML ( n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stem cell sources were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) ( n=29) or bone marrow ( n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient received a T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cell graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two primary graft failures were observed (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Engraftment of leukocytes (&gt;1.0x10(9)/l) and platelets (&gt;20x10(9)/l) was seen after a median of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade II-IV was seen in 37%, while severe grade III/IV GVHD was observed in six patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 13 patients (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (27%) due to treatment (TRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The probability of TRM was higher in patients with unrelated donors (45 vs 12%, p=0.03) and in patients with poor cytogenetics in comparison to those with a low or intermediate karyotype (75 vs 20%, p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up 12 patients relapsed (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD had a significantly higher probability of relapse compared to those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (70 vs 15%, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 20 months, the 3-year estimated disease-free survival (DFS) is 38% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21-55%] and the overall survival (OS) is 39% (95% CI: 22-56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The OS and DFS after related and unrelated transplantations was 45% (95% CI: 19-71%) vs 31% (95% CI: 9-53%) (n.s.) and 51% (95% CI: 29-73%) vs 25% (95% CI: 4-47%) (n.s.), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dose-reduced conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from related or unrelated donors is an effective treatment approach in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML and might cure a substantial number of patients who are not eligible for a standard allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
