<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several recent reports have suggested that patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are at increased risk of developing therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (tMDS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (tAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 493 patients with NHL who underwent ASCT at The University of Texas M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center between January 1990 and August 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 21 months after HDT, 22 patients developed persistent cytopenia in at least one cell line with morphologic or cytogenetic evidence of tMDS or tAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified prior fludarabine therapy, bone marrow involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and total body irradiation (TBI) as significant risk factors for the development of tMDS/tAML (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that TBI was independently associated with an increased risk of developing tMDS/tAML (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the patients who received TBI revealed that patients receiving TBI in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> were more likely to develop tMDS/tAML than those who received TBI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or thiotepa (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients developing tMDS/tAML was 7.5 months (range 0-32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TBI, especially when used in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> as the pretransplant conditioning regimen, is a significant risk factor for the development of tMDS/tAML </plain></SENT>
