<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of post-therapeutic aberrations and their predictive value, we prospectively investigated 316 samples of 95 patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) who were treated with intermediate and high dose chemotherapy (Arm A and B of the megaCHOEP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) trial of the German High Grade NHL study group) </plain></SENT>
