<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report whole-exome sequencing of 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> specimens, which unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing machinery, including U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large series analysis, these splicing pathway mutations were frequent (∼45 to ∼85%) in, and highly specific to, myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> showing features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conspicuously, most of the mutations, which occurred in a mutually exclusive manner, affected genes involved in the 3'-splice site recognition during pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing, inducing abnormal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing and compromised haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results provide the first evidence indicating that genetic alterations of the major splicing components could be involved in human pathogenesis, also implicating a novel therapeutic possibility for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
