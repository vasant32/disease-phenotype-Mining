<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used multidimensional flow cytometry in a study of patients with cytopenias and found that this technology established, changed, or refined the diagnosis in 17/121 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the flow cytometric technique of CD45 and right angle light scatter (SSC) gating with two additional markers in a three-color analysis, eight of 121 patients were found to have hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), in the absence of definitive morphologic findings of HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients were found to have non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloid abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was detected in seven of 56 patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 65 patients identified with cytopenias resulting from lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> had been referred for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with a presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with subsequent deferral of BMT upon correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The screening technique is incorporated into an extensive immunophenotyping scheme to identify hematopoietic abnormalities using multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HCL cells (detected as low as 1.3%) reside in the same position as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocytes in the CD45 and SSC plots but could be distinguished from monocytes based on the expression of HLA-DR without CD11b, and expression of CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further phenotyping of the abnormal population confirmed immunoglobulin light chain restriction, CD11c, and CD25 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was detected as aberrant mature lymphocytes expressing B lymphoid markers, CD5 and light chain restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myeloid abnormalities were identified in the myeloblast or maturing myeloid cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometric scheme described can be used in primary diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The technique is definitive, sensitive, and stresses the importance of distinguishing lymphoid from myeloid etiology of cytopenias </plain></SENT>
