<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Altered neutrophil maturation patterns have been reported useful for identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neutrophil maturation patterns based on CD11b, CD13, and CD16 were visually and numerically evaluated in 19 control, 23 MDS, 37 nondiagnostic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (NDM) specimens, and 19 also processed 1 and 2 days subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to maturation patterns illustrated previously by others as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>," 84% of controls displayed diminished acquisition of CD16, imparting a contracted appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such divergence from published "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" patterns was usually mild-moderate, considered nonspecific, and associated with delayed processing: longer intervals between collection and processing (median 20.5 vs. 5.2 h), and following 1 and 2 days delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings restricted to nonspecific contraction were found in 56% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 78% NDM specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation for aberrant patterns was still performed with mild-moderate contraction present, but concern for over interpretation led to use of an equivocal-aberrant category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine cases had aberrant or equivocal-aberrant patterns (seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, two NDM) with distinct visual alterations that differed from nonspecific contraction and had numerical evidence for a left shift: myeloblasts increased (67%) and least mature neutrophils (CD11b-/low, CD16-/low) increased (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although evidence for a left shift was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it was also seen in NDM specimens with a synchronous left shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil maturation patterns that diverge from previously illustrated "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" patterns, not specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, may be common in some settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laboratories seeking to implement FC evaluation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> must determine which findings have sufficient specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> within their own practice and patient population </plain></SENT>
