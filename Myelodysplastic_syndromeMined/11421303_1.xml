<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed hematological improvement due to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> in 9 of 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' age range was from 28 to 78 years old (mean age: 54), including 14 male and 4 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete response was obtained in 5 patients, minimal response in 4 patients, and no response in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data of peripheral blood counts and differential counts of bone marrow aspirates were not different, except that fewer chromosomal abnormalities (P = 0.086) were observed in the responder group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side effects were seen in two patients but were controllable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was significantly longer in the responder group (Log-rank P = 0.040, Wilcoxon P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of responders did not reach the median and 85% of the patients were alive after 180 months, while the median overall survival of the nonresponders was 61.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease progression was more frequently seen in the non-responder group (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated retrospectively immunohistochemical bone marrow staining, and a significantly higher percentage of CD68-positive (22.6% +/- 7.1%) and CD45RA-positive cells was observed in the responder group compared to the non-responder group (6.5% +/- 1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our present results indicate that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> is valuable as a primary treatment before other immunosuppressive treatments, because of its ease of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High efficacy with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> is expected, especially in patients in which increments in CD68-positive cells in bone marrow are observed </plain></SENT>
