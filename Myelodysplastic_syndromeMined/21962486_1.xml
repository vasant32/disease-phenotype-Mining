<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e>; however, modern studies of RT are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT to develop treatment algorithm recommendations for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloroma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who underwent treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e> at our institution between February 1990 and June 2010 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients that presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloroma</z:e> at the time of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosis (78%) have not received RT because it regressed after initial chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Yet most patients that relapsed or remained with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloroma</z:e> after chemotherapy are in the RT cohort (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three courses of RT were administered to 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiation subsite breakdown was: 39% head and neck, 24% extremity, 9% spine, 9% brain, 6% genitourinary, 6% breast, 3% pelvis, and 3% genitourinary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median dose was 20 (6-36) Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival in the RT cohort were 39% and 43%, respectively, at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 11 months since RT, only 1 patient developed progressive disease at the irradiated site and 4 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e> at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RT was well tolerated without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or late effects and provided symptom relief in 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e> were referred for RT when there was extramedullary progression, marrow relapse, or rapid symptom relief required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RT resulted in excellent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> control and palliation of symptoms without significant toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We recommend irradiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e> to at least 20 Gy, and propose 24 Gy in 12 fractions as an appropriate regimen </plain></SENT>
