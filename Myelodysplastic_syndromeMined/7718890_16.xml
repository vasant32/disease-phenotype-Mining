<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations within exons 5 through 8 were found in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these mutations were detected at the presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> whether these patients showed leukemic transformation or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations were frequently found in patients with loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-) (three of seven patients with 17p-, 43%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities (five of 14, 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the seven patients with the TP53 mutation, four patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> within 7 months from the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the remaining three died within 7 months without leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that mutations of the TP53 can be implicated in leukemic transformation and a poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
