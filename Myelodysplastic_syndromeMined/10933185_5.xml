<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BuCy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (BMT) was investigated in a phase II trial in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We gave i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bu at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg every 6h x 16 doses, followed by Cy 60 mg/kg daily for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (18 males/eight females) were treated, only eight of whom were in CR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rest were either refractory to induction chemotherapy (four patients) or in a more advanced stage of their disease (14 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (1M/8F) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 41 years (range 21-64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Engraftment to &gt; or =500 neutrophils/microl was reached at 14 days (range 10-29 days) post BMT, and the median time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was only 11 days (range 4-28 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common regimen-related toxicity was grade 2-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the post-BMT period (including BMT day +30), two patients died, one each from <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> secondary to CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>), for an early treatment-related mortality (TRM) of 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> and two of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no direct regimen-related pulmonary or neurologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, the clinical side-effect spectrum was analogous to what would be expected from a high-dose oral Bu-based regimen; there was no unique toxicity experienced with the used solvent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival in the high-risk subgroup (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients not in CR1) at 1 and 2 years post transplant was 44% and 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 13 patients still alive in CR have been followed for a median of 24 months (range 18-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analysis showed very good interdose reproducibility, and limited interpatient variability in area under the plasma concentration vs time curve, peak concentration, and clearance of Bu after this i.v. formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We conclude, that this new i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bu formulation is well tolerated; it has an impressive safety profile, and we suggest that it should be considered as appropriate replacement for oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in pretransplant conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic BMT for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
