<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Midostaurin (PKC412; N-benzoylstaurosporin) is a multitargeted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, with demonstrated activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with FLT3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by â‰¥ 50% (BR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
