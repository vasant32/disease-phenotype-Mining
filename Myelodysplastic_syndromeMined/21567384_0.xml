<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because the long-term toxicity of myeloablative radioimmunotherapy remains a matter of concern, the authors evaluated the hematopoietic damage and incidence of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in patients who received myeloablative doses of the radiolabeled antibody <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 (⁹⁰Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The occurrence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was investigated prospectively in 53 elderly patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) who underwent an autograft after high-dose radioimmunotherapy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-RIT) myeloablative conditioning with ⁹⁰Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitors and telomere length (TL) also were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 49 months, 4 patients developed sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at 6 months, 12 months, 27 months, and 36 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-RIT, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 8.29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant but transient decrease in BM granulocyte-macrophage progenitors was observed; whereas multilineage, erythroid, and fibroblast progenitors were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant and persistent shortening of BM TL also was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A matched-pair analysis comparing the study patients with 55 NHL patients who underwent autografts after chemotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning demonstrated a 8.05% 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-RIT for patients with NHL was associated with 1) limited toxicity on hematopoietic progenitors, 2) accelerated TL shortening, and 3) non-negligible incidence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which nevertheless was comparable to the incidence observed in a matched group of patients who received chemotherapy-based conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the current series of elderly patients with NHL, the development of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was not influenced substantially by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-RIT </plain></SENT>
