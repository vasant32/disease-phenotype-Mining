<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since de-novo synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26441">pyrimidine nucleotides</z:chebi> is coupled to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain (RC) via dehydroorotic acid dehydrogenase (DHODH), respiratory chain dysfunction should impair <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, we used specific RC inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22584">Antimycin A</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi>, to treat primary human keratinocytes and 143B cells, a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line, in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resulted in severe impairment of de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26441">pyrimidine nucleotide</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of RC inhibition were not restricted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> synthesis, but concerned <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26395">purine nucleotides</z:chebi>, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the total amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26395">purine nucleotides</z:chebi> was not diminished, they were significantly broken down from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphates</z:chebi> to monophosphates, reflecting impaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi> was similar to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22584">Antimycin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was surprising since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi> inhibits complex I of the respiratory chain, which is upstream of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> where DHODH interacts with the RC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid unspecific effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi>, we examined the consequences of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA mutation that causes a specific complex I defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect was much less pronounced than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi>, suggesting that complex I inhibiton cannot fully explain the marked effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">Rotenone</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26441">pyrimidine nucleotide</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
