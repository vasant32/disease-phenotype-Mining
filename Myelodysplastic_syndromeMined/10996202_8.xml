<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of cytogenetic analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> both for survival and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However it is unknown which are the numerical or structural abnormalities required for leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we studied clinically and cytogenetically 127 patients: 125 with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (24%) showed evolution of the disease during the follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities found at diagnosis in patients that progressed toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> included: del(5)(q15), +6, del(6)(q21), t(5;8)(q32;q22),-7, del(7)(q22), der(7)t(1;7)(q10;p10), t(7;11)(p15;p15), +8, del(11)(q23), del(12p), del(3)(q21), del(20)(q12) and complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients were studied cytogenetically during transformation and showed acquisition of chromosomal alterations involving dup(1q), +8, del(11)(q23), and translocations between chromosomes 1 and 8 or 7 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition we also observed gain of ploidy and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that chromosomal alterations during evolution of the disease include special chromosome gains or abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 11 and 17 with involvement of ETV-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46904">Hox</z:chebi>-A9, Pax 4, MLL genes besides a putative gene mapped at 17q25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also applied the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) to 114 patients, excluding those submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our patients were classified into four distinct risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analysis of risk groups presented by 27 patients who showed evolution of the disease revealed 18 at the high risk group and four at the intermediate-2 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the intermediate-1 risk group only five patients showed evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients evolved from RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> with gain of a del(11)(q23) or an expansion of a del(12)(p12) clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that some chromosomal alterations are responsible for each step in the evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the pathway of evolution is not unique it has been very difficult to define what genetic alteration comes first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However from several results in the literature and our own, it seems that some chromosomal alterations may predict the evolution of the disease and are correlated with short survival, as for example the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8, and might be incorporated in the high risk group in the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This score system has been proved to be useful for predicting survival and evolution from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
