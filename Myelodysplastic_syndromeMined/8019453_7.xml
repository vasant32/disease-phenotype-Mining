<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that use of unrelated donors with increased degrees of histoincompatibility, as determined by standard serological techniques, would be associated with increased difficulty in achieving engraftment and more frequent graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was analyzed in 108 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> who underwent BMT from a fully serologically HLA-matched unrelated donor (n = 40) or a partially serologically HLA-matched unrelated donor (n = 68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 236 patients who received BMT from matched sibling donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> group) over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary graft failure occurred in 5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> group, 6% of the serologically matched URD group and 15% of the partially serologically matched URD group (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors relating to primary graft failure showed the only significant variable to be full or partial serological HLA-matching in the URD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary graft failure occurred in 0.7% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> group, 15% of the serologically matched URD group and 25% of the partially serologically matched URD group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis of secondary graft failure showed the only significant variable to be a related or unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that primary graft failure is a significantly more frequent event in recipients of bone marrow from partially serologically matched URD than in recipients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> or fully serologically matched URD marrow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
