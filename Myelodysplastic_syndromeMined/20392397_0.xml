<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Forty six patients of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were included in the study by nonprobability purposive sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort was classified accordingly and the epidemiological, clinical and haematological parametres were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty six patients (28 males and 18 females) of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 46.21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the WHO classification, 12 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 24 cases of refractory cytopenia with multi lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 1 case of refractory cytopenia with multi lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ring sideroblasts, 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> unclassified and 3 cases each of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts I and II were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was seen in 37 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was documented in 33 cases </plain></SENT>
