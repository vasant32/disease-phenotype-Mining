<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to Hb value and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> degree, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were divided into 4 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mild, middle and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morbid rate and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of erythroblasts and young neutrophils in bone marrow were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that 68 out of 74 patients were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> diagnostic criteria, and 51 out of 68 patients were with neutrocytopenia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morbid rate and apoptotic rate of erythroblasts were correlated negatively with Hb and HCT value (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rates of bone marrow young neutrophils in 4 groups with different degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> were 6.00 ± 2.67%, 9.50 ± 4.42%, 13.00 ± 3.54% and 17.00 ± 2.39%, which correlated negatively with peripheral neutrophil quantity (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
