<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was known to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> melitus and to be in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three months before he had been given 7 units of red cell concentrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission the outstanding features were brown discoloration of the skin, absent body hair, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001147'>small testicles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: He had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001897'>normocytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and raised transaminases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of iron, transferrin saturation and feritin were markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liver iron content/g dried liver was 4.2 g (by biomagnetometer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiology of the lumbar vertebrae showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and sonography confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: The known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) had fed to secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, liver involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic treatment was unsuccessfully complemented by desferoxamine (up to 4 g/12 h) to release iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But very good iron excretion was then achieved with deferiprone (3 x 1 g/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient later died of the sequelae of <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even when they have not required transfusions, patients with long-standing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should be examined regularly for the possible development of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> so that iron-chelating agents can be administered as needed </plain></SENT>
