<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MRI appearance was classified into five patterns: 1) fatty marrow; 2) faint signal; 3) nodular pattern; 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> infiltration; and 5) diffuse infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MRI patterns of the femoral marrow were evaluated and compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects as well as in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity alteration, a low signal on T1-weighted SE image and a high signal on STIR image, began in the proximal femoral marrow almost symmetrically in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of abnormal signal intensity tended to gradually extend towards the distal portion of the femur as the disease progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI patterns of the femoral marrow correlated with marrow cellularity, and diffuse marrow infiltration was noted in patients with a more advanced type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progression of the MRI appearance in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was thought to be a sign suggesting evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
