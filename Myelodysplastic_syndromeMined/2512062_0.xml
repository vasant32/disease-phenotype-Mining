<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, like <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> should have defect in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CFU-Mix of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were obviously lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, it was confirmed that the CFU-Mix colonies, of leukemic patients were chiefly composed of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their incorporating rate of 3H-TdR was high in the early stage of culture, but that of 55 + 59Fe was low in the whole course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was quite different from that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults in that the CFU-Mix of the patients showed distinctive proliferation and differentiation into the leukemic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
