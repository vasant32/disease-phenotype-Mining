<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the two genes involved in this translocation have been identified: the MEL1 gene at 1p36.3, and the RPN1 gene at 3q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint in RPN1 is centromeric to the breakpoint cluster region of the inv(3) abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the MEL1 transcript is detected only in leukemic cells with t(1;3)(p36;q21), ectopic expression of MEL1 driven by RPN1 at 3q21 is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of t(1;3)(p36;q21) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the precise breakpoint in the patients has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis by use of BAC/PAC probes, we identified the breakpoint at 1p36.3 in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with t(1;3)(p36;q21): within the first intron of the MEL1 gene (one patient) or within a 29-kb region located in the 5' region of MEL1 (two other patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We detected several sizes of MEL1 transcript in two patients including the first patient, although we have not yet clarified whether MEL1 transcripts were different among the patients and whether a truncated MEL1 transcript was expressed in the first patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient showed an unusual clinical profile, repeating progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and conversion to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> three times during the 29-month survival period, which might be related to a different molecular mechanism in this patient </plain></SENT>
