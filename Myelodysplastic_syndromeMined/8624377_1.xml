<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common chromosomal aberrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are complete or partial loss of chromosomes 5 and 7, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genes important in the pathogenesis of this disease that could be associated with these gross chromosomal defects, we have employed the differential display PCR (DDPCR) procedure developed by Liang and Pardee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method allows simultaneous comparison of several cDNA sources for the presence of differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, containing a 5q deletion or a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, and three healthy controls were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial screening resulted in the identification of five and three partial cDNA sequences, respectively that were either differentially expressed in both patient samples or in individual patients, as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authenticity of aberrant expression was verified by reanalyzing the same primer combinations on newly prepared cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential expression of the three remaining fragments was subsequently checked on a larger panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, using amplicon-specific primer sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were obtained by cloning and sequencing of the fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For one partial cDNA (DC3), the original expression pattern, i.e., decreased expression in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the utility of the DDPCR procedure to isolate differentially expressed sequences in primary patient samples where the availability of cells is a limiting factor </plain></SENT>
