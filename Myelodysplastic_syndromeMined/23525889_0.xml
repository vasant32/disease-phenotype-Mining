<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Management typically depends on the clinical diagnosis with few microbiological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive hematologic patients with hepatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic lesions</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> unit from April 2009 to December 2010 at the Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 46.0 Â± 14.7 years, and 16 (61.5%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Underlying diseases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 15, 57.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 6, 23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the nine nontuberculous infectious lesions, two <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, six fungal, and one combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of confirmed, probable, and possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> (TB) cases were one, three, and four, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary TB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT, Cellestis Ltd.) was positive in seven cases, among which six were diagnosed with TB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-GIT were 75% and 81.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine (34.6%) were defined as noninfectious causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Causes of hepatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic lesion</z:e> in hematologic patients were diverse including TB, non-TB organisms, and noninfectious origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TB should be considered for patients not responding to antibacterial or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi>, even in the absence of direct microbiological evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>QFT-GIT may be useful for a differential diagnosis of hepatosplenic lesions in hematologic patients </plain></SENT>
