<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A decompressive laminectomy was attempted after failure of broad-spectrum antifungal treatment (Cancidas, V-Fend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was obtained after surgical biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scheduled lobectomy could not be performed because of altered clinical condition </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes the risk inherent to empirical antifungal treatment and the need of early biopsy in cases that do not respond to treatment </plain></SENT>
