<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Darbepoetin alfa is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) approved for treating chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This single-arm, phase 2 study examined the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa 500 microg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (after 6 weeks, poor responders received darbepoetin alfa 500 microg every 2 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was the incidence of erythroid responses (International Working Group criteria) after 13 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end-points included the incidence of erythroid responses at weeks 28 and 55, [or weeks 27 and 53 for dose escalations to every two weeks (Q2W)], and safety parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were stratified by the patient's previous ESA therapy status [ESA-na誰ve (n = 144) vs. prior ESA-treated (n = 62)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 13 weeks of therapy, 49% of ESA-na誰ve patients and 26% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved a major erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 53/55 weeks, 59% of ESA-na誰ve patients and 34% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved a major erythroid response; 82% of ESA-na誰ve patients and 55% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved target <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> of 110 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic or related adverse events occurred in 2% of patients; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolisms</z:hpo> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, darbepoetin alfa, 500 microg Q3W appeared well tolerated and increased <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
