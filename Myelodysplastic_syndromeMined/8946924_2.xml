<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the 67 of 278 patients with newly-diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or 'high-risk' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, treated in 1994 and 1995, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> during course 1 of their induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>Pneumonia</z:hpo> responded to treatment in 66%, but outcome depended on when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> diagnosed during week 1 or 2 (group 2 patients) had the lowest response rate (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in the 3rd week after treatment initiation had the best outcome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients recovering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> had an intermediate response rate (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The different patient groups were comparable with regard to age, underlying disease, prophylactic therapy, and G-CSF application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a lower CR rate was not entirely responsible for the lower response rate in group 2, failure to achieve CR predicted unsuccessful treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fungal pathogens appeared more common in group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in these patients, administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> was associated with a significantly higher failure rate (15/21 failures vs 2/9 who received no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> during week 1 or 2 are a high-risk group, and that use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> indicates a particularly poor prognosis, although we present data suggesting that earlier use of amphotericin might be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since achievement of CR was an important prognostic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, WBC transfusions particularly from donors given G-CSF should be considered as a therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, since time to failure of induction therapy and time to CR were similar in high-risk patients, new chemotherapy regimens could potentially improve both the CR rate and the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
