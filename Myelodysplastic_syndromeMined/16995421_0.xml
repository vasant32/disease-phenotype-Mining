<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Successful therapy with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients led us to study the existence of T cells attacking autologous hemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we attempted to give the direct prove of autoreactive T cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (autoreactivity analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, we analysed the capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to respond to allogeneic cells from unrelated individuals (alloreactivity analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Autoreactive lymphocytes directed against own bone marrow mononuclear cells were analysed using the modification of cell mediated cytotoxic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With one exception we did not confirm the presence of autoreactive T cells among 10 patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of alloreactivity was performed by means of standard cell mediated cytotoxic reaction and mixed lymphocyte reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the cytotoxic response to allogeneic cells was negative in 11 MDS patients from 16 analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) patients, the proportion of negative results was higher in RA (78 %) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (40 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mixed lymphocyte reaction, the response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells to allogeneic cells of unrelated individual was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preliminary testing of TNF and IFNgamma secretion examined in supernatants of effector cells showed impaired levels of both cytokines in RA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> in accordance with the findings achieved in alloreactivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Autoreactive T cells were not found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients using our experimental arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of alloreactivity showed the defect in effector--cytotoxic--phase of cell mediated cytotoxic reaction in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The initial phase of this reaction represented in vitro by mixed lymphocyte reaction gave <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possible reasons of disturbed alloreactivity and its relevance to immunity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are commented in discussion </plain></SENT>
