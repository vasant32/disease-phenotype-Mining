<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The technique of Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH), a hybrid of cytogenetics and molecular biology has increased the resolution and application of cytogenetics in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, primary investigation by conventional cytogenetic [CC] technique followed by FISH has increased our understanding of the abnormal clonal formation involving different gene region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Present study is aimed to use different kinds of in-house FISH probes in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and its correlation with conventional cytogenetic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cytogenetic study was carried out in 360 patients either from peripheral blood or from bone marrow cells suspected for various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of 360 cases were further selected for FISH study by using different types of in-house probes, such as BAC [<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> Artificial Chromosome], PAC [Phague Artificial Chromosome], alphoid, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> [Partial Chromosome Paint] and WCP [Whole Chromosome paint] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results confirmed breakpoints of inversion 16 and del 16 in case 2 and 3 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas, case 1 did not confirm the cytogenetic findings of t(15;17) by PML/RARa fusion signals as multiple cell lines were involved in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> and WCP were helpful in the identification of the marker chromosome in case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Telomeric and centromeric probes confirmed the cytogenetic findings of t(5;7) in case 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We observe from this study that, in addition to the conventional cytogenetic study, FISH study provide further confirmation of chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This facilitates our understanding of the neoplastic process more precisely for the better prognostication of the patient </plain></SENT>
