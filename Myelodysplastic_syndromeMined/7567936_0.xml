<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two disorders are not always readily separable by leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) scoring and by karyotyping, yet they have different courses and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the results of breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene rearrangement analysis with LAP score and karyotype in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was done to investigate the possibility of mixed myeloid and lymphoid lineage, which has been shown to occur in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
