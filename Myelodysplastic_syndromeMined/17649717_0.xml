<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPSS 11.5 software and correlation analysis were used to analyze the relativity among the abnormal chromosomes, the prognosis and the disease conversion in 37 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Karyotype abnormalities were found in 21 (56.8%) of 37 cases, among which 6 (16.2%) were complex karyotypes, 9 (24.3%) +8, 2(5.4%) -5/5q-, 2(5.4%) -7/7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the median time of follow-up of 12 months, 12 cases transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotypes were significantly associated with the poor prognosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation. + 8 and -7/7q- abnormalities were correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FISH was more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics for detecting mini-clonal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are some differences in abnormal karyotypes between patients in China and the western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multi-probes used in cytogenetic detections may predict the patient' s prognosis more accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher proportion of abnormal karyotypes the poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
