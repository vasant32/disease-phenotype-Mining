<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this phase 2, multicenter, open-label study, 28 thrombocytopenic patients with lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were assigned to receive romiplostim 750 μg administered subcutaneously either weekly or biweekly or administered as biweekly intravenous injections for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients also could enter a 1-year study extension phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least 1 adverse event was observed in 93% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (18% for both, and 5 events were grade 3 or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was 1 serious treatment-related adverse event in the biweekly intravenous cohort (hypersensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This hypersensitivity resolved without discontinuation of study treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients developed neutralizing antibodies or bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who completed 8 weeks of treatment, 57% had a complete platelet response, an additional 8% had a major platelet response, and 61% did not require a platelet transfusion during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weekly subcutaneous injections achieved the highest mean trough concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy profiles of romiplostim in this study suggested that weekly subcutaneous administration of 750 μg romiplostim is an appropriate starting dose for future clinical studies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
