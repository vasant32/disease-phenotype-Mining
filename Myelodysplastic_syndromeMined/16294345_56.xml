<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses to VPA were recently observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, the authors have described results of a clinical trial with VPA plus ATRA in 26 patients with poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VPA (5-10 mg/kg starting dose) and ATRA (45 mg/m(2)) were administered orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low-dose AraC or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> were permitted to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biologic activity of VPA was confirmed by serial analysis of HDAC2 protein levels in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen of 26 patients completed at least 4 weeks of VPA/ATRA treatment; 7 patients were withdrawn prematurely because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> disease (n = 3) or unacceptable neurologic and cardiovascular toxicity (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional cytoreductive treatment was required in 58% of patients enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median treatment duration was 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient achieved complete remission, one with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had a minor response, and two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) achieved a partial remission and clearance of PB blasts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter responses were accompanied by profound <z:mp ids='MP_0000322'>granulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> in both patients, reminiscent of the response pattern known from ATRA treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, cytogenetic analysis of isolated CD34(+) cells and granulocytes did not reveal terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VPA/ATRA results in transient disease control in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that has evolved from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> but not in patients with a primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
