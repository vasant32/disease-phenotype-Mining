<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with a complex karyotype with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, deletion 7q31, and double deletion 7q31 developed 8 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the course of the disease, conventional cytogenetics and interphase FISH (I-FISH) analysis detected a Ph chromosome and BCR/ABL fusion with mBCR rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a multiparametric cell scanning system that enables combined analysis with probes specific for 7/7q- and BCR/ABL in a single cell, we were able to demonstrate the presence of the BCR/ABL fusion only in cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7 and 7q31 deletion, but not in cells with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 7 or with a double deletion of 7q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose two possible models that may explain the appearance of the BCR/ABL fusion in the pre-existing treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clones characterized by chromosome 7 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
