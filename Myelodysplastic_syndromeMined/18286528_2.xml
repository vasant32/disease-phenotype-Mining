<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evaluation of therapeutic outcomes and risk factors was undertaken for patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (PST) developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 131 consecutive patients presenting to a single institution with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after treatment for PST with surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> consisted either of intensive therapy including allogeneic blood and marrow transplants or supportive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time from diagnosis of PST to development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the cytogenetic profile of patients, and their survival were similar irrespective of PST therapy with surgery alone or strategies involving chemotherapy and/or radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 131 patients was 10.5 months with a 5-year survival of 15.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy and/or transplantation resulted in a median survival of 13.6 months and a 5-year survival of 26.6% compared with 6.5 months and 2% with supportive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subset analysis of transplant recipients revealed a median survival of 17.6 months and a 37.9% 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a significantly lower recurrence rate the survival of transplant recipients was not improved secondary to a higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after PST demonstrated similar cytogenetic profiles and clinical outcomes independent of the type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly better for patients able to undergo intensive therapy compared with supportive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low recurrence rate for allograft recipients was consistent with a potent antileukemic effect that may translate into a survival benefit if TRM could be reduced </plain></SENT>
