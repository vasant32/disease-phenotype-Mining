<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath> (sAML) possess some common biological and clinical features of the corresponding de novo disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is known to have a role in haematopoiesis, and modulation of its action might contribute to the deregulation of proliferation seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) gene is closely associated with the severity of many inflammatory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to confirm this finding in a large group of patients classified as having sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in either the genotypic or allele frequencies of the polymorphism studied when compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in allele frequencies between younger and older patients, or between those patients who had an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and those who had received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the described polymorphism in the IL-1ra gene is not associated with the development of sAML </plain></SENT>
