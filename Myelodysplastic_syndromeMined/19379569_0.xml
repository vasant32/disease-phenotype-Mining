<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibition effect of gambogic acid on growth of MUTZ-1 cell line of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle were detected by morphological observation and flow cytometry respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of bax/bcl-2 gene at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level were detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the Gambogic acid inhibited the growth of MUTZ-1 cells, the inhibitory rate of gambogic acid with the range of 0.2 - 0.8 microg/ml was enhanced along with increasing of drug concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric assay showed that the apoptotic rate of MUTZ-1 cells treated by gambogic acid also was enhanced along with increasing of drug concentration, the apoptotic rates resulting from gambogic acid (0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 microg/ml) were (5 +/- 0.5)%, (13 +/- 0.5)%, (37 +/- 0.7)% and (56 +/- 0.6)% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characteristic changes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> emerged in MUTZ-1 cells after being exposed to gambogic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gambogic acid could significantly down-regulate the expressions of bcl-2 gene in a dose dependent manner, however, it had no effects on bax gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that within the range of concentration from 0.4 to 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8 microg/ml, gambogic acid can inhibit the growth of MUTZ-1 cells by inducing their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and down-regulating the expression of bcl-2 gene, which may be one of the main mechanisms underlying its antitumor effects </plain></SENT>
