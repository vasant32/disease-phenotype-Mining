<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between April 1988 and July 1998, 510 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) underwent unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 38 years (range, &lt;1-62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several conditioning regimens and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis methods were used, and T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was used in 121 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donors were serologically matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 antigens for 74% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 437 patients evaluable for engraftment, 24 (5% cumulative incidence, with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 3%-7%) failed to engraft, and an additional 33 (8% cumulative incidence; 95% CI, 6%-10%) had late graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grades II to IV GVHD developed in 47% of patients (95% CI, 43%-49%), and limited and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed at 2 years in 27% (95% CI, 24%-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of relapse at 2 years was 14% (95% CI, 11%-17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater relapse was independently associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years was 29% (95% CI, 25%-33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved DFS was independently associated with less advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype, higher cell dose, recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegativity, shorter interval from diagnosis to transplantation, and transplantation in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were treatment-related complications accounting for 82% of fatalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 2-year cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 54% (95% CI, 53%-61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of TRM occurred within the first 100 days, and 93% occurred within the first year of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher TRM was independently associated with older recipient and donor age, HLA mismatch, and recipient CMV seropositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that unrelated donor BMT cures a significant proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TRM is the major problem limiting the success of unrelated donor BMT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The observations made in this study should facilitate the design of prospective trials aimed at improving the results of unrelated donor stem cell transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
