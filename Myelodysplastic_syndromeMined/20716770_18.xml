<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 449 adults older than 60 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial (Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group 3999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was compared between patients receiving conventional-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and either zosuquidar (550 mg; 212 patients) or placebo (221 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median and 2-year overall survival values were 7.2 months and 20% on zosuquidar and 9.4 months and 23% on placebo, respectively (P = .281) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission rate was 51.9% on zosuquidar and 48.9% on placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cause mortality to day 42 was not different (zosuquidar 22.2% vs placebo 16.3%; P = .158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro modulation of P-gp activity by zosuquidar and expression of P-gp, multidrug resistance-related protein 1, lung resistance protein, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> resistance protein, were comparable in the 2 arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor-risk cytogenetics were more common in P-gp(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-gp expression and cytogenetics were correlated, though independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that zosuquidar did not improve outcome in older <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, in part, because of the presence P-gp independent mechanisms of resistance </plain></SENT>
