<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of the inducible NOS (iNOS) by bone marrow cells from the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level by RT-PCR assay and at the protein level by immunohistochemical staining using a specific anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The iNOS message was present in 92% of bone marrow tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (11 out of 12) by an examination using RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basically, iNOS message was negative or very weak in control (1/9) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (0/7) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was supported by immunohistochemical findings that the iNOS was positive in most of the bone marrow samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (9 out of 12), while bone marrow cells of control (O out of 12) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (O out of 5) cases were basically negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining for CD68 antigen, which is a marker for macrophage lineage cells, and iNOS was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>iNOS was dominantly localized to bone marrow macrophages, although a part of myeloid cells were also positively stained with anti-iNOS antibody in a part of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that there is some in vivo induction of iNOS expression for local NO production that might be involved in the dysregulation of hematopoiesis in bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
