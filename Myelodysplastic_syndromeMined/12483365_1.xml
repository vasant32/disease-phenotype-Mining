<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate a potential therapeutic role for megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) we compared the in vitro response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and myelodysplastic megakaryopoiesis to MGDF on bone marrow mononuclear cells from nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and four healthy donors in a short term liquid culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were incubated with MGDF alone (1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml) and in combination with 20 ng/ml stem cell factor, 2 U/ml erythropoietin (EPO) and 100 ng/ml interleukin-3 (IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytospins were prepared after 4 days and 10 days for CD61 APAAP staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ploidy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> stained CD61 positive cells were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD61+ cell number significantly increased (13-fold after 4 days, 56-fold after 10 days of culture) when MGDF (100 ng/ml) was added to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (NBM) cultures (P=0.0003; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cultures the absolute number of endomitotic cells as well as the percentage of polyploid cells remained significantly lower than in NBM after 10 days (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of MGDF on polyploidization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells was significantly dose dependent (P=0.0051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between peripheral platelet count, cellularity of the bone marrow, number of bone marrow megakaryocytes or FAB-subtype and response to MGDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional administration of IL-3 resulted in a left-shift of megakaryopoiesis in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even though the response of myelodysplastic megakaryocytic progenitors to MGDF shows inter-individual variations, it is significantly impaired overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that higher doses of MGDF may be able to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
