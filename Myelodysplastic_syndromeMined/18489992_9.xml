<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 23% were in the first complete remission at the time of transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) was 53% and 23%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent had equal to or greater than grade 2 gut involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of overall and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) was 93% and 63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of patients who were evaluable +100 days after transplant were in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse rate was 25% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic assays of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolic acid</z:chebi> (MPA) showed a therapeutic area under the curve (AUC) at the dosage of 3 g daily, although a large inter- and intraindividual variations of MPA plasma levels were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination of CSA plus MMF in the fludarabine plus melphalan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> RIC setting is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding GVHD, this combination allowed to control aGVHD but lead to a high incidence of cGVHD, so that newer strategies are required, especially in trying to decrease gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
