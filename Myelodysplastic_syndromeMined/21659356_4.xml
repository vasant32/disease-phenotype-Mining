<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rationale for this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of this regimen prospectively in patients with a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 45 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were conditioned with 3×14 g/m(2) treosulfan and 5×30 mg/m(2) fludarabine followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-2 (44%), refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (27%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (4%), refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblasts (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-1 (2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with isolated del (5q) (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was unclassified in 7% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent of the patients had a favorable karyotype, 29% an unfavorable one, and 18% an intermediate karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for engraftment, adverse events, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, overall survival and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient showed primary engraftment of neutrophils after a median of 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-hematologic adverse events of grade III-IV in severity included mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and gastrointestinal symptoms (80% and 22% of the patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 780 days, the 2-year overall and disease-free survival estimates were 71% and 67%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 2-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse were 17% and 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our safety and efficacy data suggest that treosulfan-based conditioning therapy is a promising treatment option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>. clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01062490 </plain></SENT>
