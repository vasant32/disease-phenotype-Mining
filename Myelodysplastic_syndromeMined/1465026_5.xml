<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) die of complications due to cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have demonstrated that in an essential number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients cytopenia can be ameliorated by exogenously supplied growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated endogenous serum levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 in 15 healthy individuals and 34 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No circulating growth factors were detected in the serum of healthy controls, nor was IL-3 measurable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF serum levels, however, were elevated in a significant number of patients (26.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels did not correlate with FAB classification, leukocyte count or chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor expression were detected between healthy individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with increased endogenous GM-CSF serum level and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> surface receptor expression responded to exogenously applied GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the light of these results, a functional alteration of growth factor receptors or disturbances of signal transduction pathways must be discussed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
