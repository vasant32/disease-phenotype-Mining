<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis, 45 AML and six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were screened for activating mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of them (eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were found positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 10 patients and 10 others without activating N-ras mutation were further analysed by direct sequencing of the amplified exons for p53 mutations and for atypical N-ras mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beside the activating mutations in the N-ras gene, no additional transforming or nontransforming mutations could be detected in the N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, exon 7 of p53 was mutated in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients without activating N-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that p53 mutations occurred with half the frequency of N-ras mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and that no positive correlation could be found between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of mutations in N-ras and p53 genes </plain></SENT>
