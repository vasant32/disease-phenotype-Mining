<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> confirmed by final diagnosis and were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony growth of hemopoietic progenitors in vitro excludes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> and other preleukemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, within the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> group a low number of CFU-C (11 colonies or fewer) was a highly significant indicator for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the limited number of cytogenetic results in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> patients did not reach statistical significance in relation to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
