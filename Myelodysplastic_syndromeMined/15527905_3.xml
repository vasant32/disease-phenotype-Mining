<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete chromosome losses and chromosome gains are frequently found, but there is a relatively high incidence of unbalanced translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with an unbalanced translocation, der(11)t(11;12)(q23;q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients were 69 years of age and diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) according to the high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic hypogranulation of neutrophils was evident as a dysplastic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blasts were positive for CD4 and CD41a as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis showed complex karyotypes including a der(11)t(1;11)(q11;p15)t(11;12)(q23;q13) in case 1 and der(11)t(11;12)(q23;q13) in case 2 plus several marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spectral karyotyping confirmed the der(11)t(11; 12)(q23;q13) and clarified the origin of marker chromosomes, resulting in del(5q) and del(7q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses with a probe for the MLL gene demonstrated that the breakpoints at 11q23 were telomeric to the MLL gene in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH also showed that the breakpoint at 11p15 of the case 1 was telomeric to the NUP98 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering another reported case, our results indicate that the der(11)t(11;12)(q23;q13) is a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality and may be involved in the pathogenesis of advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
