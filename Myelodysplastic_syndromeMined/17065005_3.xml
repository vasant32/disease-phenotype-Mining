<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the BEACOPP regimen, treatment intervals were shortened and the dose-intensity was increased compared with those in the ABVD regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, vinblastine and darcarbacine), resulting in a long-term disease-free survival rate of approximately 75-80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the BEACOPP regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between April 2001 and February 2004, 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> of stage IIB or higher who had received no previous treatment were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were aged 17-69 years (median 22 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic types were mixed cellularity in four cases and nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stages were stage IIB in four cases, stage III in 12 cases, and stage IV in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (95%) of the 20 patients achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate was 100% and the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 89.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug reactions were grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 12 patients, grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in seven patients, and grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicities in two patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> in one patient and ALT/AST elevation in one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BEACOPP regimen for advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> showed an excellent complete remission rate and high efficacy even in stage III/IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a long-term risk of the BEACOPP regimen is the development of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, long-term follow-up of these patients, including monitoring for toxicities, is necessary </plain></SENT>
