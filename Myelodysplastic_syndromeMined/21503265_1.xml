<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) is often found dysregulated in preleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiological substrates of HePTP include the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 and p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific modulators of HePTP catalytic activity will be useful for elucidating mechanisms of MAPK regulation in hematopietic cells, and may also provide treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report the discovery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8075">phenoxyacetic acids</z:chebi> as inhibitors of HePTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structure-activity relationship (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>) analysis and in silico docking studies reveal the molecular basis of HePTP inhibition by these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that these compounds are able to penetrate cell membranes and inhibit HePTP in human T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
