<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and extensive dysplastic features in peripheral blood granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The granulocytes expressed CD11b, CD13, CD15, CD33, and CD43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The granulocytes also expressed CD4 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis showed a clonal t(5;12)(q33;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient improved on antibiotics with partial improvement in the dysplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, shortly after, the patient experienced paravertebral extramedullary blast transformation followed by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient died a few days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report describing anomalous expression of CD4 on granulocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the breakpoint on chromosome 12 is near the CD4 gene, which is mapped to 12p12, we hypothesize that dysregulation of the CD4 gene may have occurred resulting in its persistent expression on mature and maturing granulocytes </plain></SENT>
