<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a whole blood flow cytometry method combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52293">thiazole orange</z:chebi> and anti-CD41a-staining to assess RP in 71 healthy subjects, six with thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), nine with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), and 12 patients who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> had slightly elevated RP counts compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients had elevated RP counts, and RP &gt;15% were associated with treatment response (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7/10 patients after HSCT, an increase of RP preceded Plt recovery, whereas in patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regeneration, the assessment of RP allowed the differentiation between conditions with high Plt turnover, such as GvHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, indicated by high RP counts, and graft failure, indicated by low RP counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the rationale for prospective studies on the diagnostic and prognostic value of RP counts in larger patient populations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and after HSCT </plain></SENT>
