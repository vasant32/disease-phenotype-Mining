<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the analysis of a t(10;12)(q24;p13) identified in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the t(10;12) results in the generation of an in-frame fusion between ETV6 and GOT1, a gene encoding a cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, two other fusion transcripts involving exons from yet unidentified genes were detected, as well as expression of an uncharacterized gene from the 10q24 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work identifies GOT1 as a novel fusion partner of ETV6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
