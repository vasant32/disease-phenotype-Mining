<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, DLI frequently also result in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several clinical and experimental lines of evidence have suggested that CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To develop methods to reduce the incidence of GVHD associated with DLI, we administered defined numbers of CD4(+) donor T cells after ex vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD8(+) lymphocytes to 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335737" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed hematologic malignancies</z:e> after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cohorts of patients received 0.3, 1.0, or 1.5 x 10(8) CD4(+) cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12 of 38 patients (32%) evaluable for toxicity developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 6 of 27 patients (22%) receiving 0.3 x 10(8) CD4 cells/kg developed GVHD compared with 6 of 11 patients (55%) who received &gt;/=1.0 x 10(8) CD4 cells/kg (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related mortality was low (3%), with 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the setting of immunosuppression for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease responses after CD4(+) DLI were documented in 15 of 19 patients (79%) with early-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) relapse, 5 of 6 patients (83%) with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with early-phase <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> relapse, the Kaplan-Meier probability of achieving complete cytogenetic remission was 87% and the probability of complete molecular response was 78% at 1 year after DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to complete cytogenetic response and molecular response in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> was 13 weeks (range, 9 to 30 weeks) and 34 weeks (range, 10 to 56 weeks), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median time to response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> was 26 weeks (range, 15 to 62 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in this trial who developed GVHD demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, but the presence of GVHD was not required for patients to achieve a response, because 48% of responding patients never developed evidence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> who did not respond at dose level 1 subsequently achieved complete cytogenetic remission after a second infusion of CD8-depleted cells at dose level 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with evidence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism who achieved a complete remission after DLI, cytogenetic analysis of marrow cells also demonstrated conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that relatively low numbers of CD8-depleted donor lymphocytes are effective in inducing complete remissions in patients with stable-phase <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> who have relapsed after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Because of the relatively low risk of toxicity associated with the infusion of defined numbers of CD4(+) donor cells, further studies can be undertaken in the setting of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> to prevent relapse after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
