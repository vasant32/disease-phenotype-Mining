<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of combined treatment with gamma-globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, immunosuppressor and Chinese medicines on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> (HBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the treated group (10 cases) received combined therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) plus Chinese medicine Langchuang Recipe after being treated impactively with gamma-globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group (9 cases) was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo>, peripheral white blood cell (WBC), complement C3, 24 h urinary protein excretion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> activity index (LAI) were observed, and a follow-up was carried out for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After one-month treatment, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> was relieved significantly in the treated group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), showing an improvement superior to that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01); after three months treatment, the level of complement C3 increased (P &lt; 0.01), while the 24 h urinary protein excretion and LAI decreased in the treated group (P &lt; 0.05), showing significant difference as compared with those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up period, 3 cases withdrew from the trial because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and 4 cases manifested full moon-face and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> in the control group, while no adverse reaction was found in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with integrated Chinese and Western medicine could effectively improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo>, alleviate the clinical symptoms, suppress the activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> in patients, and reduce the adverse reaction of treatment, showing a superiority to the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> combining with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
