<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gram stain of the specimen revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram negative</z:mp> rods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> state developed after the operation, it was controlled by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> therapy for 3 days, followed by phenytoin administration </plain></SENT>
