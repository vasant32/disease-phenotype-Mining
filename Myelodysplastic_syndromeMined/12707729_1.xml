<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> therapy-alone or in combination with erythropoietin (EPO)-indicate that long-term treatment is possibly a decisive factor for therapy success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we treated an 81-year-old female, transfusion-dependent patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and EPO over a period of 2 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A long-lasting erythroid response could be observed with a reduction of EPO to 2 x 10000 IU and 1 x 10000 IU and, at present, once a week application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> alone (1 x 500 mg) </plain></SENT>
