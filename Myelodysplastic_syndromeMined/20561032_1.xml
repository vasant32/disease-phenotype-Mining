<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to enlarge the knowledge on these rarely occurring ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The members of the European Group for Immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemias</z:hpo> (EGIL) searched retrospectively their databases for NT-ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We collected data of 36 European children from seven European countries with NT-ALL diagnosed since 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients reached complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their blasts were negative for peroxidase and BCR-ABL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten children were diagnosed as T-cell ALL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) EGIL categories (T-I n=2, T-II n=2, T-III n=3, T-IV n=3) and four displayed various structural chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 T-ALL remained in 1st CR; one died in CR from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and one is alive in 2nd CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 88 (7-213) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL was diagnosed in 26 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen were positive for ETV6-RUNX1 and are alive in 1st CR for 32-147 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten children were ETV6-RUNX1 negative and remained in 1st CR for 16-163 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One girl with hypodiploid and NT metaphases and ETV6-RUNX1-negative BCP-ALL and one of two boys with NT-BCP-ALL not examined for ETV6-RUNX1 died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after stem cell transplantation in 2nd/3rd CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> developed in two patients with NT-BCP-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of NT-ALL and favorable prognosis of most NT-ALL across different immunophenotypic and/or genetic ALL subtypes </plain></SENT>
