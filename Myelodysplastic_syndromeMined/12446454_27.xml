<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We undertook to systematically analyze the entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome by gene amplification and direct sequencing in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>; results were compared with concomitantly studied 8 healthy volunteers as well as mtDNA sequences in a standard database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide changes that were present in our healthy controls as well as those in published databases were counted as polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was no increase in the number of mtDNA genes harboring polymorphisms or "new" mutations between our patients and healthy controls, although there were a few more mtDNA changes resulting in amino acid changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (9 in 8 controls versus 16 in 10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty new mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleotide substitutions, were found among the 10 patients, distributed throughout the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome; 5 mutations resulted in amino acid changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the mutations in controls produced amino acid changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were not able to confirm previously described mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> or "hot spots" in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase I and II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support a major role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genomic instability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and they fail to reproduce previous reports of significant or widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mutations in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modest changes in mutation numbers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> microsatellites may be evidence of increased mutagenesis in mtDNA, or, more likely, a reflection of limited clonality among hematopoietic stem cells in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
