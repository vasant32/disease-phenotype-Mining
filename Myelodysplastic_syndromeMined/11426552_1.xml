<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may explain the lower remission rate obtained with conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the association of Fludarabine with intermediate dose Ara-C has produced interesting results particularly in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on 42 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients treated with a combination of Fludarabine, intermediate dose Ara-C, G-CSF with or without an antracycline (FLANG, FLAG-IDA or FLAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, complete remissions (CR) were documented in 14 patients (33%) and partial responses (PR) in 12 (29%), while 10 patients proved resistant (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (14%) died early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a prognostically unfavorable karyotype had a negative impact on the CR rate (20% compared to 50% for patients with an intermediate prognosis karyotype, p 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with FLAG, FLANG and FLAG-IDA had similar CR rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of this analysis, after a mean follow-up of 12 months, the mean duration of CR is 16 months (range 3-66) and the mean survival is 11 months (range 1-67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to granulocyte recovery (neutrophils &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 20 days (range 12-39) and 50 x 10(9)/l platelets were reached at a median of 26 days (range 9-56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these Fludarabine containing regimens proved to be an effective and tolerable treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients above 70 years of age may also benefit from this therapy, however the problem of treating patients with adverse chromosomal abnormalities still remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
