<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's karyotype at the time of diagnosis was 46,X,-X,t(4;21;8)(q25;q22;q22),+6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had an early relapse while being treated on a standard protocol and had significant difficulty in attaining a second remission </plain></SENT>
