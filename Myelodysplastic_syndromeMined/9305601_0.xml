<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A third of the cases were unclassifiable according to the FAB system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five cases were 'idiopathic' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), four were secondary to chemo- and/or radiotherapy, and 15 (1/3) were found associated with a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> (such as familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, chromosome syndrome, or various dysmorphic features) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polyclonality was retained in some cases, even in the 'idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>' group, demonstrating that non-malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> does exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex ratio was well balanced in this study; mean age at diagnosis was 4 years; median survival was 3 years; prognosis was better in girls and in young children; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes were associated with a better outcome, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 with intermediate survival, and other chromosomal findings, including <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and 19, with a worse prognosis; refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation, and cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> were associated with a bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> conditions deserving more studies </plain></SENT>
