<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of erythropoietin use in hematologic patients; to analyze the extent to which recommendations are applied as provided by Spanish prescribing information, American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (ASCO) and American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines, as well as specific recommendations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), and to perform a descriptive analysis of costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A descriptive retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient selection was performed by Unidad de Atención Farmacéutica a Pacientes Externos (UFPE: Pharmaceutical Outpatient Care Unit) during a 3-month period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed to month 9 after selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (37% males) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, effectiveness was 57%; while in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group it was 45-64% (depending on criteria used to measure erythroid response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 patients (MDSs excluded) only 4 (17%) met indication criteria--adjustment to erythroid response at 4 and 8 weeks, and dosage titration when needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continued treatment with erythropoietin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-responders amounted to 59-69% of total expense for non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a high percentage of therapy failures and inconsistency between erythropoietin use recommendations and clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This circumstance, as well as the high financial impact it entails, makes it essential that monitoring and follow-up strategies are implemented to contribute to an optimal usage of erythropoiesis stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
