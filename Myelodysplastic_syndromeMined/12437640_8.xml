<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The issue of whether, in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), haematological response to cytokines, particularly to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo), is a phenomenon related to the stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haemopoietic cells or to the differentiation of cells belonging to the abnormal clone remains an open question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the pattern of response to rHuEpo treatment of bone marrow (BM) cells, we evaluated in 13 low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities the number of cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cells by conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) and by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, enabling the simultaneous visualization of FISH chromosomal abnormalities in morphologically and immunophenotypically identifiable BM elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients responding to rHuEpo presented a lower number of abnormal metaphases at diagnosis in comparison with patients who did not respond (22.74% vs 76.23%, P = &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by the combined morphological FISH analysis, showing that, before treatment, BM samples from patients responding to rHuEpo had a lower proportion of both FISH abnormal erythroid (36.48% vs 66.93%, P = 0.002) and myeloid (40.76% vs 67.70%, P = 0.014) elements than unresponsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After rHuEpo treatment, responding patients presented a significantly lower proportion of FISH abnormal erythroid precursors than observed before treatment (16.93%vs 36.48%, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in responding patients, a significantly lower proportion of FISH abnormal erythroid elements (16.93% vs 66.30%, P &lt; 0.001) was detected in comparison with unresponsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that, in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities, response to rHuEpo may be due to the proliferation of karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid precursors, possibly representing residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid elements </plain></SENT>
