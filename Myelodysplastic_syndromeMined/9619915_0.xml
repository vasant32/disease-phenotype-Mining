<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared the effects of ATRA and GCSF on the colony growth of 10 MDS marrows, in semi-solid and liquid serum-free mononuclear cell (MNC) cultures, supplemented with a mixture of stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GmCSF) (SIGm mix), which is fully-supportive for myeloid and erythroid (with erythropoietin (EPO)) colony formation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 1/10 MDS patients produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cell (GmCFC) numbers, under SIGm conditions and erythroid colonies (ECFC) were subnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATRA (10(-7) M) increased GmCFC numbers (P=0.05) in semi-solid cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow MNC and decreased erythroid colonies in cultures of marrow from either source (P=0.008 and P=0.0001 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATRA enhanced neutrophilic maturation in liquid cultures of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and myelodysplastic CD34 + ve cells, as detected by conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and acquisition of CD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to ATRA, GCSF increased Gm colony size but not numbers in semi-solid cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow MNC, which suggests the cytokine augments post-progenitor amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This would explain why GCSF increased cell yields in liquid cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> MNC while GmCFC accumulation remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GCSF, though, increased Gm colony numbers in semi-solid cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow MNC (P=0.014) so that 4/10 patients now grew colonies within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was again probably due to increasing clone size, so that some clusters, the numbers of which may be elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, were now scored as colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data indicate that ATRA can enhance the maturation of the progeny of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> GmCFC whilst GCSF can augment their amplification </plain></SENT>
