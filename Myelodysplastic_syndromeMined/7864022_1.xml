<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An abnormal multimeric pattern was observed in 10/18 MDS and 4/4 PA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormality of this specific protein is the discrete expression of the basic disorder, and is reversible when hemopoiesis is normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the data do not allow any conclusion, abnormal synthesis is the likely explantation of the abnormality </plain></SENT>
