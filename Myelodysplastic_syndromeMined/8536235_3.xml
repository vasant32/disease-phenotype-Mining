<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since cytogenetic analysis detects only actively dividing clones, the presence of a single abnormal cell among 20 cells analyzed raises doubts about its clonal nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enables rapid detection of certain chromosomal abnormalities in metaphase and interphase cells, thus enabling detection of minor or inactive clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> each having random cell(s) were investigated thus: at diagnosis, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a cell with +8 (two cases) or +9 (one case) and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and a cell with +4 (one case), +7 (one case), or two cells with +9, +22/ +10, +17, +17 (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153876" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ALL in remission</z:e> had one cell with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient, a male aged 66 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, was found to have a minor <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone in his diagnostic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A follow-up marrow 42 months later showed no <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cell among 62 metaphases analyzed, and the percentage of trisomic cells using FISH on interphase cells was within the control range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient has survived for more than 42 months requiring no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single-cell abnormalities in the other six cases proved to be random events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that single-cell abnormalities may not be clonal or at most indicate the presence of a minor clone well below the level of cytogenetic detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of such minor clones is at present unclear </plain></SENT>
