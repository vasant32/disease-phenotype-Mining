<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been insufficient examination of the factors affecting long-term survival of more than 5 years in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that is not in remission at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> not in remission at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) performed at our institution between January 1999 and July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with a median age of 39 years received intensified conditioning (n = 9), standard (n = 12) or reduced-intensity conditioning (n = 21) for allo-HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received individual chemotherapy for cytoreduction during the three weeks prior to reduced-intensity conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 29), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-accelerated phase (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 10) and plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, cytogenetic abnormalities were intermediate (44%) or poor (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of blast cells in bone marrow (BM) was 26.0% (range; 0.2-100) before the start of chemotherapy for allo-HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had leukemic involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stem cell sources were related BM (7%), related peripheral blood (31%), unrelated BM (48%) and unrelated cord blood (CB) (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Engraftment was achieved in 33 (79%) of 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time to engraftment was 17 days (range: 9-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At five years, the cumulative probabilities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were 63% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 85 months for surviving patients, the five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival rate and overall survival (OS) were 17% and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At five years, the cumulative probability of non-relapse mortality was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the univariable analyses of the influence of pre-transplant variables on OS, poor-risk cytogenetics, number of BM blasts (&gt;26%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and CB as stem cell source were significantly associated with worse prognosis (p = .03, p = .01, p = .02 and p &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, based on a landmark analysis at 6 months post-transplant, the five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS in patients with and without prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were 64% and 17% (p = .022), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effects possibly mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD may have played a crucial role in long-term survival in, or cure of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
