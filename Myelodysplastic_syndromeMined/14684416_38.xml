<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the facility and reliability of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) with several observers reviewing the same diagnostic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also wanted to determine if the WHO classification provided additional information about predictability of clinical response outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To accomplish these goals we reviewed 103 previously diagnosed cases of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 92% interobserver agreement (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four of these patients had been entered into clinical trials using growth factors by the Nordic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WHO classification reliably predicted therapeutic response to the combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate differed significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>/RS) with regard to therapeutic response (75% versus 9%; P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, in the group of patients with less than 5% marrow blasts, there was a difference in median survival between patients with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (51% surviving at 67 months) and those with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (median survival, 28.5 months; P =.03) </plain></SENT>
