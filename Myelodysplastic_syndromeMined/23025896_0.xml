<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: Chromosome changes in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with persistent cytopenia are often considered diagnostic for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive cytogenetic evaluations may give evidence of the real pathogenetic role of these changes in cases with cytopenia without morphological signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chromosome anomalies were found in the BM of three patients, without any morphological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 1) an acquired complex rearrangement of chromosome 21 in a boy with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (SAA); the rearrangement caused the loss of exons 2-8 of the RUNX1 gene with subsequent hypoexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) a constitutional complex rearrangement of chromosome 21 in a girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001905'>congenital thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; the rearrangement led to RUNX1 disruption and hypoexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3) an acquired paracentric inversion of chromosome 1, in which two regions at the breakpoints were shown to be lost, in a boy with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>; the MPL gene, localized in chromosome 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> was not mutated neither disrupted, but its expression was severely reduced: we postulate that the aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was due to position effects acting both in cis and in trans, and causing Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A clonal anomaly in BM does not imply per se a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: a subgroup of BM hypoplastic disorders is directly due to chromosome structural anomalies with effects on specific genes, as was the case of RUNX1 and MPL in the patients here reported with diagnosis of SAA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anomaly may be either acquired or constitutional, and it may act by deletion/disruption of the gene, or by position effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Full cytogenetic investigations, including a-CGH, should always be part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and peripheral cytopenias </plain></SENT>
