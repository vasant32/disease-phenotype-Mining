<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow scintigraphy using 99mTc-sulfer colloid 370-550 MBq was analysed in 47 patients, including 28 cases of AA, 12 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>(10 MDS-RA and 2 MDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and 7 of AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo>, hypercellular bone marrow associated with uneven disappearance of marrow image or focal hematopoiesis were found in 28 AA and 2 of 30 MDS-RA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow imaging showed uneven low accumulation of radioactivity in 12 and focal patterns in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> or high activity and expanded periphery of bone marrow was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (8 RA and 2 RAEB cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes of activity and distribution of bone marrow during the transforming course were noticed in 4 AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patch distribution and focal hemopoiesis is the outstanding features of AA marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The imaging features as well as expanded manner and increased activity of bone marrow are helpful to the differential diagnosis, evaluation of clinical status and explanation of marrow aspirate results </plain></SENT>
