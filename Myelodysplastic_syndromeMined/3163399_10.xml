<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients treated with alpha-interferon (alpha IFN) (3 megaunits/day for up to 6 months), one patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) underwent an almost complete response while one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) showed a reduction in monocyte count; no improvement was observed in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (trRAEB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients Leu7+ and Leu11a+ phenotypic natural killer (NK) cells were consistently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in percentage numbers but functional NK activity was consistently reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NK activity was enhanced by exposure to alpha IFN in vitro, but was very variable in patients being treated with the agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between clinical response and changed NK activity in patients receiving alpha IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that NK cells are unlikely to play a central role in the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
