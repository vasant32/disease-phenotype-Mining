<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory or de novo high-risk NHL receiving one myeloablative dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by tandem stem cell reinfusion were evaluated for dose estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The injected activity was 30 MBq/kg in 12 patients and 45 MBq/kg in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose estimation was performed 1 week prior to (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan by injection of (111)In-ibritumomab tiuxetan (median activity: 200 MBq) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absorbed dose (D) and the biologically effective dose (BED) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The absorbed doses per unit activity (Gy/GBq) were [median (range)]: heart wall 4.6 (2.5-9.7), kidneys 5.1 (2.8-10.5), liver 6.1 (3.9-10.4), lungs 2.9 (1.5-6.8), red marrow 1.0 (0.5-1.7), spleen 7.0 (1.5-14.4) and testes 4.9 (2.9-16.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absorbed dose (Gy) for the 15 patients treated with 45 MBq/kg were: heart wall 17.0 (8.7-25.4), kidneys 17.1 (7.9-22.4), liver 20.8 (15.4-28.3), lungs 8.1 (5.4-11.4), red marrow 3.1 (2.0-4.0), spleen 26.2 (17.0-35.6) and testes 17.3 (9.0-28.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the highest activities the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haematological toxicity was mild or moderate and of very short duration, and it was independent of the red marrow absorbed dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> or treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No non-haematological toxicity (liver, kidney, lung) was observed during a follow-up period of 24-48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of 45 MBq/kg of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in association with stem cell autografting resulted in patients being free of toxicity in non-haematological organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These clinical findings were in complete agreement with our dose estimations, considering both organ doses and BED values </plain></SENT>
