<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether place of residence (rural versus urban) is associated with clinical outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who received an unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' residential ZIP code at the time of transplant was used to determine rural or urban designation based on the Rural Urban Commuting Codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 6140 patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) from 121 U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HCT centers: 1179 (19%) came from rural areas, whereas 4961 (81%) came from urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rural and urban patients were similar in patient-, disease-, and transplant-related characteristics aside from household income and distance traveled to the HCT center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for income and other significant patient, disease, and transplant-related variables, the risk of overall mortality between patients residing in rural and urban areas were not statistically significant (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.93-1.10, P = .74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar outcomes were noted for treatment-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient's income, derived from the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Census and based on their residential ZIP code, was independently associated with outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study showed no differences in the clinical outcomes of patients from rural or urban areas after unrelated donor HCT </plain></SENT>
