<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The WHO classification offers prognostic information and helps with the treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, morphological changes are subject to potential inter-observer variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to explore the reliability of the 2008 WHO classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, reviewing 100 samples previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using the 2001 WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens were collected from 10 hospitals and were evaluated by 10 morphologists, working in five pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each observer evaluated 20 samples, and each sample was analyzed independently by two morphologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second observer was blinded to the clinical and laboratory data, except for the peripheral blood (PB) counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cases were considered as unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e>) by the 2001 WHO classification, but only three remained as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e> by the 2008 WHO proposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discordance was observed in 26 of the 95 samples considered suitable (27 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although there were a high number of observers taking part, the rate of discordance was quite similar among the five pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inter-observer concordance was very good regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>) (10 of 12 cases, 84 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> (nine of 10 cases, 90 %), and also good regarding refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (37 of 50 cases, 74 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the categories with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were not reproducible in most of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of concordance with refractory cytopenia with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 40 % (two of five cases) and 25 % with RA with ring sideroblasts (two of eight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the 2008 WHO classification gives a more accurate stratification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but also illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
