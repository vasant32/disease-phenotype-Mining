<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ultimate diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e>), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether it is a specific or nonspecific lesion, cutaneous involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a poor prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> cutis (LC), a specific dermal infiltrate of malignant hematopoietic cells, particularly is associated with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the pathology of our patient's lesions revealed a more sparse sprinkling of atypical mononuclear cells indicative of an inflammatory recruitment of leukemic cells to the dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the guarded prognosis of this high-risk subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mandates continued monitoring for development of LC and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
