<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we present data on a total of 218 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, including 148 patients with CN (23/148 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected CSF3R nonsense mutations at 17 different nucleotide positions (thereof 10 new mutations) which lead to a loss of 1 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 23 patients with CN with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, 18 (78%) were shown to harbor a CSF3R mutation, indicating that these mutations, although not a necessary condition, are highly predictive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> even if detected in a low percentage of transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In serial analyses of 50 patients with CSF3R mutations we were able to follow the clonal dynamics of mutated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could demonstrate that even a highly clonal hematopoiesis did not inevitably show a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that acquisition of a CSF3R mutation is an early event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> that has to be accompanied by cooperating molecular events, which remain to be defined </plain></SENT>
