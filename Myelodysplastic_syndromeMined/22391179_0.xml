<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is mainly used for its prognostic classification, but still remains some unrepeatable results in the same group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to compare the levels of peripheral blood mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), ferroprotein (SF), Vit <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classified by IPSS and to explore the relationship between the prognosis and laboratory indexes above mentioned in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>116 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were divided into 4 group: low-risk, intermediate risk-I, intermediate risk-II and high-risk according to IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The index of MCV, serum LDH, β2-MG, SF and Vit <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients prior treatment and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group and each groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the levels of MCV, LDH, β2-MG, SF were Vit <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences of serum LDH among the 4 groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), and the levels of serum LDH increased in turn: low-risk, intermediate risk I, intermediate risk II and high-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum β2-MG level in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the groups of low risk, intermediate risk I and intermediate risk II (P &lt; 0.05), the difference among the latter three groups was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in MCV, SF and Vit <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the level of serum LDH and β2-MG seems to have a certain correlation with the progress and prognosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may be useful for predicting the prognosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> besides IPSS scoring system </plain></SENT>
