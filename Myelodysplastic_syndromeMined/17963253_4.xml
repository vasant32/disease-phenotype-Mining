<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite mechanisms to maintain iron homeostasis, harmful iron accumulation can occur in patients with hereditary defects of regulatory proteins, such as hepcidin, or with transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identifying the role of nontransferrin bound iron in the pathogenesis of disease allows for better treatment strategies to prevent and reverse iron toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, accurate noninvasive methods to reliably assess iron accumulation and chelation are now available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous chelation coverage, which can be achieved with combination therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> and deferiprone) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi>, is expected to provide optimal protection from iron toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As more long-term data on these drugs accumulate, the role of oral and combination chelation therapies in relation to blood transfusion, as well as other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> disorders, will become clearer </plain></SENT>
