<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of patients enrolled onto an intergroup CLL trial were examined for this complication </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.2 years, six patients (1.2%) to date have developed therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 3), t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 2), or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolving to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 1), from 27 to 53 months (median, 34 months) after study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This included five (3.5%) of 142 patients treated with fludarabine plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and one (0.5%) of 188 receiving fludarabine; no <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>-treated patients developed t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P =.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At study entry, the median age among these six patients was 56 years (range, 44 to 72 years); three were male; the CLL Rai stage was I/II (n = 4) or III/IV (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response to CLL therapy was complete (n = 4) or partial remission (n = 1) and stable disease (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marrow cytogenetics, obtained in three of six cases at diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, were complex, with abnormalities in either or both chromosomes 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other abnormalities involved chromosomes X, 1, 8, 12, 17, and 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival after diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 3.5 months (range, 0.5 to 10.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings raise the possibility that alkylator-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog combination therapy may increase the risk of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, which is of particular relevance with regard to ongoing trials using these combination therapies </plain></SENT>
