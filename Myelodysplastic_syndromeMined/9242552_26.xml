<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>16;21 translocation is a recurrent primary abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes involved in this translocation are ERG on chromosome 21 and TLS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FUS</z:e> on chromosome 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement of the two chromosomes forms the TLS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FUS</z:e>-ERG fusion gene and produces a consistent chimeric transcript on the der (21) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 19 patients with t(16;21)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, including 2 patients who evolved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and detected the chimeric transcripts of the TLS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FUS</z:e>-ERG fusion gene in the patients during various clinical stages by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the patients with t(16;21) are characterized by a relatively younger age (median age, 22 years old), involvement of various subtypes of French-American-British classification and a poor prognosis: 18 of the 19 patients died of the disease (median survival was 16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four types of TLS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FUS</z:e>-ERG chimeric transcripts including a novel type were noted in the RT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The novel transcript contained an additional 138 nucleotides consisting of TLS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FUS</z:e> exon 8 and ERG exons 7 and 8 and had an in-frame fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These chimeric transcripts were consistently detectable in the samples obtained not only at diagnosis and relapse but also in short and long complete remission, suggesting that t(16;21)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is resistant to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we recommend that t(16;21) should be monitored by RT-PCR even in clinical remission and the patients should be treated by other more powerful modality like stem-cell transplantation in the first remission </plain></SENT>
