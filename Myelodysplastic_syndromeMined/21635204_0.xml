<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) TL among cases of histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 65) who were treatment-naive with no prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history to age-matched controls (n = 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative TL was measured in PBLs and saliva by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in CD15+ and CD19+ cells by flow cytometry-fluorescence in situ hybridization (flow-FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) mutations were assessed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and sex, relative TLs were reduced in PBLs (p = 0.02), CD15+ (p = 0.01), CD19+ (p = 0.25), and saliva (p = 0.13) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases versus controls, although only the PBL and CD15+ results were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, CD15+ and CD19+ cell TLs were positively correlated (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PBL TL was reduced among those occupationally exposed to paints and pesticides, but was not associated with hTERT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to further investigate constitutional telomere attrition as a possible predisposing factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
