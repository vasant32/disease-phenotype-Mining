<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetic techniques enabled us to clarify numerical and structural alterations previously detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques in 37 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH), we found the most recurrent alterations to be deletion of 5q (70%), 18q (35%), 7q (32%), 11q (30%), and 20q (24%), gain of 11q (35%) and 8q (24%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in 35% of the patients, 20 amplifications were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These amplifications were shown by FISH to involve some genes previously described as amplified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, such as ERBB2, MLL, and RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, two other genes, BCL6 and BCL2, which are classically related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were shown for the first time to be involved in amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic alterations involving different subtelomeric regions with losses in 4p16, 5p15.3, 6q27, 18p11.3, and 18q23 and gains in 1p36.3 and 19p13.3 were detected by HR-CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Array CGH analysis of the subtelomeric regions in some samples was able to confirm a number of these alterations and found some additional alterations not detected by conventional CGH </plain></SENT>
