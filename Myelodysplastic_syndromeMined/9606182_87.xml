<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the t(8;21) translocation, the AML1 (CBFA2/PEBP2alphaB) gene becomes fused to the MTG8 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously found that the terminal differentiation step leading to mature neutrophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was inhibited by the ectopic expression of the AML1-MTG8 fusion protein in L-G murine myeloid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that overexpression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AML1 proteins reverses this inhibition and restores the competence to differentiate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) interact with AML1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal region of AML1 is responsible for the induction of cell differentiation and for the interaction with p300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p300 stimulates AML1-dependent transcription and the induction of cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that p300 plays critical roles in AML1-dependent transcription during the differentiation of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, AML1 and its associated factors p300 and CBFbeta, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are targets of chromosomal rearrangements in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, function cooperatively in the differentiation of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
