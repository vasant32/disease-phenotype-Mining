<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic significance of ras gene mutations in patients with these disorders has been a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although abnormalities in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> 1 (NF1) gene, which is a gene involved in the ras pathway, have been observed frequently in patients with juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, the role of these abnormalities in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, bone marrow specimens that were obtained from previously untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were examined for ras mutations, and the levels of NF1 protein expression were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ras point mutations were detected in 16 of 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (19%) and in 21 of 90 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (50%) had ras gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased bone marrow levels of NF1 protein (&lt; 70% of the median level detected in control bone marrow specimens) were observed in 20 of 66 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (30.3%) and in 8 of 29 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (27.6%); none of the patients with ras gene mutations had decreased bone marrow levels of NF1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of a mutant ras gene was associated with a shorter complete remission duration (CRD) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.05) but had no effect on survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who had decreased NF1 protein levels had a slightly longer CRD compared with patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NF1 levels (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the NF1 level had no significant impact on survival among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When patients with low NF1 levels were grouped with patients who had ras mutations, the patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had a significantly longer CRD compared with the patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that a reduction in NF1 protein expression and the presence of ras point mutations may complement each other and that they both play a complex role in the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
