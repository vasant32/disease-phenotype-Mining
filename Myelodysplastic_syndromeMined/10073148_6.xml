<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with TRL/t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital between January 1989 and September 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report is concerned with those patients who initially had been treated with chemotherapeutic agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients (median age, 55 years) developed TRL (n = 4) or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median interval between the development of TRL/t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and initial treatment was 94 months (range 23-190 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the primary therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had received intense and prolonged treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CPA) and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX), with a median cumulative dose of 55 g/body (range 16.4-288.5 g) for CPA and 480 mg/m2 (range 395-625.5 mg/m2) for DOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were subsequently treated by chemotherapy and one received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must remain alert to the risks associated with unproven medical practices which include long-term administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with TRL/t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may respond to intense salvage combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
