<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were reviewed and classified according to the clinical and morphological FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD34-positive (CD34 +) hematopoietic cells and the number of clusters of CD34+ cells in 10 HPF were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases the CD34+ cell count was similar to the blast percentage determined morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In RA, however, not only typical blasts but also less immature hemopoietic cells lying morphologically between blasts and promyelocytes were stained with CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ cell count and cluster values were significantly higher in RA than in BMB with reactive changes (p&lt;0.0001 for both), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> than in RA (p=0.0006 and p=0.0189, respectively), in RAEBt than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (p=0.0001 and p=0.0038), and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in RAEBt (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of CD34+ cell clusters in RA correlated with increased risk of progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CD34 immunostaining in BMB is a useful tool for distinguishing RA from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, assessing blast percentage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, classifying them according to FAB, and following their evolution </plain></SENT>
