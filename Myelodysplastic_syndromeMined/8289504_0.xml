<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a history of previous chemo- and/or radiotherapy for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) was diagnosed in 49 patients, six patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and one patient from biphenotypic and undifferentiated AL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberration rate was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 54% of the patients, simple or specific chromosomal anomalies with not more than three cytogenetic defects were found, such as t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), t(9;11) and t(4;11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 37% of the patients had a karyotype highly characteristic of sAL with more than 4 structural cytogenetic defects, and/or -5, 5q-, -7, 7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This unusual distribution of cytogenetic defects in these patients is undoubtedly due to patient selection, since only patients who received aggressive chemotherapy were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>25 patients had previously been diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presence or absence of a preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and karyotype were predictive parameters for achievement of complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CR was obtained in 47% of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or simple aberrations, but only in 24% of the patients with complex anomalies (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients without a prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had a higher CR rate (53%) than patients with a preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (20%) (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CR rate was highest in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or simple aberrations without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (56%), compared to those with complex anomalies and a prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (14%) (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, from a clinical point of view, AL in the former patients should be considered as de novo AL and not as secondary, therapy-related AL and that therapeutic nihilism is no longer justified in these patients </plain></SENT>
