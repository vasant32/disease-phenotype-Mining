<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because clinical drug resistance is caused by low-grade expression of a responsible gene, highly sensitive methods are desirable for its detection in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) transcripts, and applied it to clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: MDR1 transcripts were amplified using the NASBA technique combined with sandwich hybridization of amplified MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> followed by chemiluminescence detection on an automated analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was achieved through competitive coamplification of in vitro-generated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, which acts as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The competitive NASBA assay exhibited higher sensitivity (reliable detection limit was 100 copies of MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and linearity over a broader dynamic range (7 logarithmic orders) than the competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 33 clinical samples obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were successfully assayed, demonstrating its feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDR1 expression-compensated with beta-actin expression-ranged from 1.4 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(6) (median 4.8 x 10(5)) copies/microg <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, while the range of MDR1 expression in peripheral blood samples from 15 healthy adults was from 8.9 x 10(4) to 5.2 x 10(5) (median 2.2 x 10(5)) copies/microg <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MDR1 expression in 8 of 33 clinical samples exceeded the median of healthy adult samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The competitive NASBA assay is applicable to MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantification in clinical samples and would contribute to detection of clinical multidrug resistance </plain></SENT>
