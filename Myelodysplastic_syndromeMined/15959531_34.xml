<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found by real-time RT-PCR that Dlk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were high in CD34(+) cells in 10 of 12 MDS samples compared with CD34(+) cells from 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, Dlk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was elevated in mononuclear, low density bone marrow cells from 11/38 MDS patients, 5/11 AML M6 and 2/4 AML M7 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5/6 erythroleukemia and 2/2 megakaryocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines highly expressed Dlk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of Dlk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> markedly increased during megakaryocytic differentiation of both CMK megakaryoblasts as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High serum levels of Dlk1 occurred in RA (4/10) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (2/10) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed that forced expression of Dlk1 enhanced proliferation of K562 cells growing in 1% fetal bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hematopoiesis of Dlk1 knockout mice suggested that Dlk1 contributed to granulocyte, megakaryocyte and B-cell clonogenic growth and was needed for generation of splenic B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, Dlk1 is overexpressed in selected samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (especially RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (particularly M6, M7), and it appears to be associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of megakaryocytes and B cells </plain></SENT>
