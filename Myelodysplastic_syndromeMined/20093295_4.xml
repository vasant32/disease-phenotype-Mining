<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with an isodicentric X chromosome [idic(X)(q13)] occur in elderly women and frequently display ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the rarity of idic(X)(q13), little is known about its formation, whether a fusion gene is generated, and patterns of additional aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here present an SNP array study of 14 idic(X)-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, collected through an international collaborative effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints clustered in two regions of segmental duplications and were not in a gene, making dosage effects from the concurrent gain of Xpter-q13 and loss of Xq13-qter, rather than a fusion gene, the most likely pathogenetic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis revealed involvement of the inactive X chromosomes in five cases and of the active in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ABCB7 gene, mutated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> and spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, is in the deleted region, suggesting that loss of this gene underlies the frequent presence of ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional genetic abnormalities were present in 12/14 (86%), including partial <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> for 9p (one case) and 4q (two cases) associated with homozygous mutations of JAK2 and TET2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, TET2 mutations were seen in 4/11 (36%) analyzed cases, thus constituting a common secondary event in idic(X)-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
