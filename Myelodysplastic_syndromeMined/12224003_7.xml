<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen preceding hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) causes a rapid decrease in the platelet count and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, possibly indicating platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As impacts during the conditioning regimen may predict later transplantation-associated complications, we investigated changes in platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (GP) and the liberation of microparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet receptors and granules of 49 patients undergoing HSCT were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis before and after the different phases of the conditioning regimen [chemotherapy, total body irradiation (TBI), therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG)] and final transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following chemotherapy a high surface expression of CD62P, a low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> staining, and a reduced surface expression of CD42b (part of the GP Ib/V/IX complex) were found, indicating an irreversible activation of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, elevated levels of circulating microparticles were observed, which may reinforce the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ATG leads to an elevated surface expression of PAC-1 epitopes, which are neoepitopes appearing after activation of GP IIb/IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant degranulation was not detectable, which may be the consequence of inhibitory influences on platelets during ATG-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948245" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytokine release syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TBI and transplantation itself had no influence on platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was able to demonstrate activating effects on platelets by certain phases of the conditioning regimen in patients receiving HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy, in particular, leads to a strong and irreversible platelet activation and a generation of microparticles, which may cause an increased <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings underline the impact of platelets on the pathogenesis of hemostatic complications during HSCT </plain></SENT>
