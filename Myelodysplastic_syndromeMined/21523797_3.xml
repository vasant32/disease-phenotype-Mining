<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported on 88 (61%) of these patients who met criteria for WHO defined "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with isolated del(5q)." The remaining 55 patients were classified as having "other" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> variants (n = 29; 20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 14; 10%), or myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPN; n = 12; 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was available in 138 patients and mutation screening revealed 20 cases with JAK2, 6 with IDH, and 3 with MPL mutations; JAK2 and MPL mutations were seen mostly in MPN or "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(5q)" whereas IDH mutations were frequent in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival for the 143 patient cohort was 35 months and leukemic transformation (LT) was documented in 19 (~13%) cases. "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(5q)" had the best prognosis with median survival of 66 months and LT rate of ~6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was poor among the other myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> subgroups regardless of specific morphologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified higher leukocyte count and percentage of bone marrow and circulating blasts as independent predictors of shortened survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first two parameters and the presence of IDH mutations predicted inferior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current study validates the prognostic relevance of considering "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(5q)" as a separate WHO subcategory and identifies <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, higher blast count, and IDH mutations as being prognostically detrimental, in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> associated with isolated del(5q) </plain></SENT>
