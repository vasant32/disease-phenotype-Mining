<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Darbepoetin alpha (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) is an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein (ESP) that is more highly glycosylated and has a longer half-life relative to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), thus, allowing less frequent administration, increased convenience, and better compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 81 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were enrolled at 9 Spanish centers and who received once-weekly, subcutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> (75-300 microg) for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (38 of 69 evaluable patients) achieved responses; 30.4% of were major responses, and 24.6% were minor responses; 64.7% of rHuEPO-naive patients and 45.7% rHuEPO-treated patients responded; and 43.2% had received previous rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most responses (65.8%) occurred at or before Week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range, 38-87 years), the median age at the initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> treatment was 75 years (range, 39-91 years), and 56.8% of patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time from last ESP dose to <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> initiation was 16.8 weeks (range, 0.0-159.0 weeks; &lt;1 week in 53.1% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the French-American-British classification system (n = 81 patients), 39.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 46.9% had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 9.9% had RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 1.2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, and 2.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the International Prognostic Scoring System (n = 47 patients), 55.3% of patients were in the low-risk group, and 36.2% of patients were in the intermediate-1-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was 8.9 g/dL (range, 8.4-9.1 g/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Starting <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> dose was 75 microg per week in 3.7% of patients, 150 microg per week in 65.4% of patients, and 300 microg per week in 29.6% of patients (the dose was increased in 18.5% of patients and reduced in 9.9% of patients; median time to dose adjustment, 8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-related adverse reactions occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, 55% of evaluable patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> safely achieved an erythroid response </plain></SENT>
