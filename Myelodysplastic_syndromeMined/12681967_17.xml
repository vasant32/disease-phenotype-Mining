<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In contrast with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> in which the value of immunophenotypic studies is well established, information on the immunophenotypic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main goal of the present study was to explore the immunophenotypic differences between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, including changes in distribution of cell lineages as well as phenotypic aberrations and blockades in cell maturation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the proportion of bone marrow CD34+ cells was higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients but the most immature progenitors (CD34+CD38-) were less represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast the proportion of myelomonocytic CD34+ cells was greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, translating into an increased myeloid/non-myeloid CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This suggests that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the majority of CD34+ cells are already committed to the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon analyzing the granulo-monocytic differentiation pathway, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed an increased proportion of monocytic cells with a decreased percentage of cells of neutrophil lineage, leading to a lower neutrophil/monocytic cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maturational arrests in the monocytic but not in the neutrophil differentiation pathway were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) such blockades mainly occurred during the earliest stages of differentiation but in the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes they occurred in later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic aberrations occurred in 90% of patients and a high proportion of cases showed &gt;=2 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results show that, in addition to an abnormal distribution of the bone marrow cell compartment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients frequently show aberrant phenotypes and maturational arrests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some of these features may help in cases in which the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is questionable </plain></SENT>
