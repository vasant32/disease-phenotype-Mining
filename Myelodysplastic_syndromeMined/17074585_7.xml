<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, del(20q) occurs with one or more cytogenetic changes when it is associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and del(20q) to ascertain the risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We categorized del(20q) into two groups: one with the del(20q) clone (&gt; or =50% marrow metaphases), corresponding to genomic integrity, and the other with a late appearance of a minor del(20q) clone (&lt;50% metaphases) with additional cytogenetic changes, representing genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with del(20q) at initial presentation, the negative factors in predicting prognosis on survival are (i) INT-2/High risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, (ii) any additional cytogenetic changes, or (iii) minor del(20q) clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The late appearance of del(20q) at any phase is linked to a significantly unfavorable prognosis, thus indicating the clinical and biological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of del(20q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
