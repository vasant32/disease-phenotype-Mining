<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemical analysis are as follows: (1) Labile antigens of T lymphocytes were well preserved, thus allowing analysis of distribution of T lymphocyte subsets in situ: (2) the average number of T3, T4 and T8 lymphocyte of the diffuse infiltrate was about 2%, 0.4%, 0.5%, respectively, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells in bone marrow, and T4/T8 of T cells were below 1.0 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; (3) there were cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> showing T lymphocyte aggregation in bone marrow, but no patient exhibited progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> are of importance in the evaluation of pathogenesis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
