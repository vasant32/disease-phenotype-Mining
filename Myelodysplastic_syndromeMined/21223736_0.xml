<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA corresponding to exon 12 of NPM1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 232 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of mutants was by direct sequencing and classification of mutation types by sequencing followed by plasmid cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NPM1 mutants were found in 9 patients (3.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the mutants were type A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared with those with NPM1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, patients with the mutant were of lower ANC \[0.60 (0.12 - 2.91) × 10(9)/L vs 1.02 (0 - 10.23) × 10(9)/L, P = 0.046\], higher blast percent in bone marrow \[0.050 (0 - 0.090) vs 0.025 (0 - 0.190), P = 0.035\], decreased BFU-E \[0 (0 - 0)/10(5) BMMNC vs 6 (0 - 40)/10(5) BMMNC, P = 0.038\] and increased serum vitamin B(12) \[936.40 (373.80 - 2400.00) pmol/L vs 557.85 (17.00 - 3032.10) pmol/L, P = 0.045\] The chromosomal karyotypes of patients with NPM1 mutant were predominantly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with NPM1 gene mutations have some unique clinical and laboratory features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results give new hint for the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
