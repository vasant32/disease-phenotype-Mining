<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed putative MSC markers and their relationship to CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) within intact human bone marrow in paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies of benign, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and leukemic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) marrows using tissue microarrays to facilitate scanning, image analysis and quantitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that CD271+, ALP+ MSCs formed an extensive branching perivascular, periosteal and parenchymal network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nestin was brightly positive in capillary/arteriolar endothelium and occasional subendothelial cells, whereas CD146 was most brightly expressed in SMA+ vascular smooth muscle/pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD271+ MSCs were distinct by double immunofluorescence from CD163+ macrophages and were in close contact with but distinct from brightly nestin+ and from brightly CD146+ vascular elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence revealed an intimate spatial relationship between CD34+ HSPCs and CD271+ MSCs; remarkably, 86% of CD34+ HSPCs were in direct contact with CD271+ MSCs across benign, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> marrows, predominantly in a perivascular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the intercrine chemokine CXCL12 was strong in the vasculature in both benign and neoplastic marrow, but was also present in extravascular parenchymal cells, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified these parenchymal cells as MSCs by ALP/CXCL12 and CD271/CXCL12 double immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area covered by CXCL12+ ALP+ MSCs was significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with benign and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> marrow (P=0.021, Kruskal-Wallis test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preservation of direct CD271+ MSC/CD34+ HSPC contact across benign and neoplastic marrow suggests a physiologically important role for the CD271+ MSC/CD34+ HSPC relationship and possible abnormal exposure of CD34+ HSPCs to increased MSC CXCL12 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
