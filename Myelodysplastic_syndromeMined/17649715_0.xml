<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MUTZ-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of 2-ME, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity in MUTZ-1 cells was examined by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (TRAP-ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FCM analysis showed that cells in G0/G1 phase and S phase were decreased, while in G2/M phase increased after exposed to 1,2 and 4 micromol/L of 2-ME for 12 hours (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1 and 2 micromol/L of 2-ME had no notable effect on MUTZ-1 cells as compared with the control group (P &gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells incubated with 1, 2 and 4 micromol/L of 2-ME for 36 hours were induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was between (12.87 +/- 0.86)% and (21.82 +/- 1.71)% with a dose- and time- dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was significantly inhibited in these concentration and negatively correlated with cell number in G2/M phase (r = -0.979, P = 0.021) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> (r = -0.970, P = 0.030 ), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inhibition effect of telomerase activity was enhanced in a dose- and time- dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 2-ME-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibition of telomerase activity provide a possible mechanism for explaining the 2-ME's anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
