<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an observational, non-interventional, prospective, multicentre study, QOL was evaluated in 148 patients with newly diagnosed low- and intermediate-risk IPSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QOL measures (QOL-E v.2, LASA and EQ-5D) and patient-related candidate determinants of QOL were assessed for up to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' QOL scores were compared with those obtained by appointed hematologists' assessment and with ECOG performance status (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> was not prevalent at diagnosis, though physical QOL and energy levels were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion-dependent patients had worse QOL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, Hb levels and comorbidities were a major determinant of QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians' perception of patients' well-being correlated with patients' QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians underestimated the impact of disturbances on patients' QOL, mainly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-specific components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECOG PS did not discriminate patients according to QOL status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with QOL is confirmed, while co-morbidities emerge as an independent predictor of QOL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> is not a major concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ECOG PS is not a valuable surrogate of patient's QOL, thus highlighting that physician's judgment of patient's well-being must not substitute patient-reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Appropriate questionnaires should be used to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' QOL in order to improve communication and therapeutic choice </plain></SENT>
