<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was based on medical interview, physical examination, blood biochemistry, peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cytomorphology and cytochemistry, trephine biopsy and cytogenetic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hematologic examinations were done according to routine methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on BM cells from 24-48 h cultures in standard conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least 15-20 GTG-banded metaphases were analyzed in every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival time (ST) of patients differed significantly between the FAB or WHO groups, with p=0.0004 for FAB and p=0.02 for WHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was more common in less favorable groups, with p=0.0001 for FAB and p=0.00016 for WHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of IPSS prognostic index among the groups showed statistically significant difference (p=0.0004 for FAB, and p=0.0001 for WHO), whereas the distribution of karyotypic abnormalities did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in univariate analysis statistically significant influence on ST showed, beside the both classification systems: cytogenetics, the presence of blasts in PB, age and IPSS index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis the sole independent prognostic factors were: PB blasts and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the WHO classification offers a good prognostic tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the karyotype and the presence of blasts in PB should always be taken into account </plain></SENT>
