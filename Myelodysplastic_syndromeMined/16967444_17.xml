<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> administered in the outpatient setting is well tolerated and can induce complete hematological remission in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At higher doses, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> has activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients were retrospectively identified who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> with bone marrow blast counts between 21 and 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with blast counts up to 29% were initially treated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but by WHO now meet criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with blast counts over 29% were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> after being deemed poor candidates for induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> 75 mg/m2/day was administered subcutaneously for 7 days every 4 weeks, which was defined as 1 cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 60% (12/20): complete response (CR; n = 4; 20%); partial response (PR; n = 5; 25%); hematologic improvement (HI; n = 3; 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival of responders was 15+ months compared with 2.5 months for nonresponders (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During therapy, responders had an Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 or 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common toxic event was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients were hospitalized during the first cycle of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> administered in the outpatient setting can induce remission in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The therapy is well tolerated and might be an alternative for patients unlikely to tolerate standard induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
