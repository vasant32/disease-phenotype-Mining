<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The FMS gene encodes the functional cell surface receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1, the macrophage- and monocyte-specific growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Codons 969 and 301 have been identified as potentially involved in promoting the transforming activity of FMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations at codon 301 are believed to lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> by ligand independence and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residue</z:chebi> at codon 969 has been shown to be involved in a negative regulatory activity, which is disrupted by amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study reports on the frequency of point mutations at these codons, in vivo, in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied 110 patients [67 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 48 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)], 5 patients being studied at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the later <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a total incidence of 12.7% (14/110) with mutations in codon 969 and 1.8% (2/110) with mutations in codon 301 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> stage of the disease but not in the preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and one had a mutation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stage but not upon transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the somatic origin of these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FMS mutations were most prevalent (20%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> type M4 (23%), both of which are characterized by monocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of 51 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had a constitutional codon 969 mutation, which may represent a marker for predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
