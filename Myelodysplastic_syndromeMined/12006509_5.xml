<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine p53 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, for which treatment with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> analogues was widely used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adequate leukemic or dysplastic cells were available in 17 of 82 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> that occurred in a multicenter, population-based cohort of 23,170 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 17 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33749">platinum compounds</z:chebi> and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> with or without DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> and/or radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six received other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, in one case, with radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted and p53 exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 were amplified by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations and loss of heterozygosity were analyzed on the WAVE instrument (Transgenomic) followed by selected analysis by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven p53 mutations involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four exons studied and one polymorphism were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA analyses were consistent with loss of heterozygosity for four of the mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 11 mutations occurred in 9 cases, such that 6 of 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based regimens (55%) and 3 of 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after other treatments (50%) contained p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that occurred after treatment with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> analogues contained two mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among eight mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> analogues, there were four G-to-A transitions and one G-to-C transversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after multiagent therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The propensity for G-to-A transitions may reflect specific DNA damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> analogues </plain></SENT>
