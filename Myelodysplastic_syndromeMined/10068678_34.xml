<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because N-ras has not been shown to induce these disorders in an in vivo model, the role of N-ras in the evolution of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the potential of N-ras to induce myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) cells infected with a retroviral vector carrying activated N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60% of these mice developed hematopoietic disorders, including severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e> resembling human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with differentiation (French-American-British [FAB] classification M2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other reconstituted mice succumbed to hematopoietic defects that were pathologically similar to human MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter disorders appeared to be due to a myeloid impairment that was demonstrated by enumeration of day-12 colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S) and by in vitro colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003644'>thymic atrophy</z:mp> and peripheral blood (PB) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> was also evident in N-ras reconstituted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with a model in which antiproliferative effects are a primary consequence of N-ras mutations and secondary transforming events are necessary for the development of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of an in vivo model for N-ras induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
