<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of a second unit helps ensure engraftment in larger adults and those with comorbidities, even though only one unit engrafts in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of a patient who developed donor-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (ddMDS) after double umbilical cord-blood transplantation (dUCB HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no cases of ddMDS have been described in a patient with a history of ALL in molecular remission after receiving a dUCB HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current molecular techniques, including analysis of short tandem repeats (STR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allowed us to firmly establish donor origin </plain></SENT>
