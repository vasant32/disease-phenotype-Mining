<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the predictive value of donor chimerism analyses in sorted CD34(+) peripheral blood cells in 90 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of relapse after four years was significantly increased in cases with decreasing or incomplete CD34(+) donor chimerism (57% vs. 18%, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed decreasing CD34(+) donor chimerism as an independent predictor of relapse and inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interval between a decrease of CD34(+) chimerism of less than 80% and hematologic relapse was 61 days (range 0-567) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of CD34(+) donor chimerism in the peripheral blood allows prediction of imminent relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation even when a disease-specific marker is lacking </plain></SENT>
