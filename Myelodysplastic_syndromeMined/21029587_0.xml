<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data, including basic information, etiology, management and outcomes of pregnant women with extremely severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, admitted to Peking University People's Hospital from January 2004 to March 2009, were retrospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The management of these cases varied according to different etiology and the symptoms: (1) PLT were maintained &gt; 20 × 10(9)/L and hemoglobulin &gt; 70 g/L in those women without spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>; (2) PLT transfusion would be required when PLT &lt; 10 × 10(9)/L or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occur and RBC would be supplied when hematocrit &lt; 25% and hemoglobulin &lt; 70 g/L; (3) Hemoglobulin should be &gt; 70 g/L and PLT &gt; 30 × 10(9)/L before cesarean section or delivery; (4) Predinisone and/or intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) would be given in women complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) when PLT &lt; (20 - 30) × 10(9)/L or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PLT would be given if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above management were failed, or PLT &lt; 10 × 10(9)/L, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> would be closely monitored and delivery would be planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Twenty-six cases were identified among 9302 deliveries during the study period (0.28%), with an average of maternal age of 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen were diagnosed before conception and 9 during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 26 women, half received regular prenatal check in our hospital and the average gestations at diagnosis was 24 weeks and the other half without regular prenatal visits and the average gestations at diagnosis was 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Etiology was identified in 24 out of the 26 women, including 14 (54%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (CAA) and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Management: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 26 women received blood products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 ITP cases, 6 received predinisone and IVIG and 8 only took predinisone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 26 patients (35%) had pregnant complications, among which 6 (6/9) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall average gestation at delivery was 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 2 delivered vaginally with the average blood loss of 83 ml and 23 cesarean sections were performed with the average blood loss of 410 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) Perinatal outcomes: There were 26 perinatal babies, among which 1 died intrauterine and 25 were born alive (12 preterm infants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The average birth weight was 2877 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Neonatal severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> presented in 2 newborns whose mother complicated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of extremely severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> during pregnancy is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, managed mainly by predinisone and IVIG, followed by CAA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may require supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy complicated with extremely severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is not an indication of termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Better maternal and fetal outcomes can be achieved through proper treatment based on the etiology, intensive care in prevention and management of complications and cesarean section </plain></SENT>
