<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Topotecan stabilizes the complex formed between topoisomerase I and DNA, leading to DNA strand breakage and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In accordance with preclinical studies, clinical efficacy of topotecan was documented in <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp>, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> is the dose-limiting toxicity and nonhematologic side effects are generally mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of topotecan against a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> is now increasingly exploited as well as its role in high-dose chemotherapy programs with stem cell support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both lymphoblastic and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, topotecan has been widely utilised both as single agent or associated to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs with proven efficacy in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the published phase II studies demonstrated that heavily pre-treated, relapsing patients achieve a high percentage of overall responses with manageable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In myelodisplastic syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelomonocitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> a recently published study shows positive results for the combination of topotecan and cytarabin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Topotecan seems to preferentially affect the abnormal cytogenetic clones and in patients achieving a complete response, a conversion from an aneuploid to a diploid karyotipe was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, several schedules have been tested in the phase I setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When utilized alone and at very low dosage, the drug yielded 15% of objective responses and a lack of extrahematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest seems to be the association of topotecan with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxanes</z:chebi> that needs to be supported by growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> Topotecan has been utilized as single agent in heavily pre-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The obtained results show good activity and again <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> as preminent toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of topotecan in high-dose chemotherapy regimens for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The utilization of topotecan in high-dose chemotherapy is one of the newer and more interesting applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid tumors</z:e> (i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e>) are actually investigated by many authors, who have indicated that this drug can be used preferentially as a part of diversified programs containing overlimit dosages of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, topotecan demonstrated to be an effective drug to mobilize CD34+ cells for autografting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A general conclusion is that topotecan is an interesting addition to the actual chemotherapy scenario, both because of its mechanism of action and its toxicity profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The present review of the new possibility of utilization, give us the idea that topotecan has activity in several hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>; further investigations in these diseases (i.e., induction treatment, combination chemotherapy) are then warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The broad spectrum of antitumor activity and the characteristics of toxicity make it also interesting for use in both the circulating progenitor cell mobilization and in the consolidation phase of high-dose chemotherapy programs </plain></SENT>
