<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the stimulation of hematopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial was performed to evaluate whether a combination of these agents was effective in relieving the cytopenias associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients with low- or intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled in a 12-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATRA was administered orally at the dose of 80 mg/m(2) per day in 2 divided doses for 7 consecutive days every other week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human EPO was given subcutaneously 3 times a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EPO dose was initiated at 150 U/kg and was increased to 300 U/kg if after 6 weeks there was no or there was suboptimal erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who responded to therapy were continued on ATRA and EPO at the same doses for 6 additional months (extension phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further treatment was given to patients with a continued response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant erythroid responses with increases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of at least 1 g/dL or reduction of transfusion needs were seen in 13 (48%) patients, with 4 showing improved responses after dose escalation of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten (37%) patients displayed continued responses during 6 months of extended treatment, and 7 (26%) are still responsive after a follow-up period of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil responses were observed in 5 of 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and platelet responses were observed in 6 of 9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients displayed trilineage responses that were sustained during continuation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Side effects were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but were of mild entity and did not require discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the combination ATRA + EPO is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with low- and intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The optimal ATRA and EPO schedule and the role of maintenance treatment remain to be determined and warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
