<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using miRNA arrays, we measured expression of 1,145 miRNAs in CD34+ bone marrow cells obtained from 39 MDS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and compared them with those of six healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential miRNA expression was analyzed and a panel of upregulated (n=13) and downregulated (n=9) miRNAs were found (P&lt;0.001) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased expression of a large miRNA cluster mapped within the 14q32 locus was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in miRNA expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes showed a distinction between early and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; an apparent dissimilarity was observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we monitored upregulation of proapoptotic miR-34a, which may contribute to the <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is an early report describing differential expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells, likely reflecting their disease-specific regulation </plain></SENT>
