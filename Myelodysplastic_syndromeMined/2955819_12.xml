<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cell proliferation in the auto MLR was 25% of the control (P less than .02), whereas proliferation in the allo MLR was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When control T cells were stimulated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> B cells, their proliferative response was only 57% of the control (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for these abnormalities was studied by determining the capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells to produce interleukin 2 (IL 2) and to generate IL 2 receptors (IL 2R) following stimulation with control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the auto MLR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, only 3% +/- 2% of T cells developed IL 2R positivity, whereas in control cultures 12% +/- 2% of T cells were positive, as determined by immunofluorescence, using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the IL 2R, and FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> T cells were stimulated by control B cells, IL 2R generation and the production of IL 2 were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when control T cells were stimulated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> B cells or control B cells, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> B cells induced production of only 26% of IL 2 as compared with control B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel experiments, IL 2R generation in control T cells stimulated by either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or control B cells was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, T and B cell interactions are impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> T cells develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> quantities of IL 2R and produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of IL 2 when stimulated by control B cells, they are markedly impaired when stimulated by self B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> B cells can induce IL 2R generation in control T cells but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic B cells are also defective in inducing IL 2 production by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells in an allo MLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These in vitro abnormalities strongly suggest that generation of lymphocytes with immunoregulatory functions is impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
