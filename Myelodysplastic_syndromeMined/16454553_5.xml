<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is most intensely expressed by the most immature thymus T-lineage cells and is more intensely expressed by CD34-positive/CD33-positive myeloid cells (compared to more mature myeloid cells) and the earliest CD34-positive/CD10-positive B-cell precursor cells (compared to cells of later B-cell precursor stages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD99 (MIC2) is characteristically expressed in precursor B- and T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, as well as in Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206663" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CPNET">primitive neuroectodermal tumors</z:e> (ES/PNET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown to be expressed in a few terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive myeloid processes, but has been uniformly negative in TdT-negative myeloid processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A more recent study showed that 43% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) and 55% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chloromas</z:e> express CD99, concluding that CD99 is commonly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and rarely seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this study speculated that MIC2 expression was probably not limited to TdT-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, there was no comparison with TdT reactivity in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> may occasionally be difficult to distinguish morphologically from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and ES/ PNET, we undertook a study to analyze MIC2 expression in conjunction with TdT reactivity in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and ES/PNET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We studied bone marrow core and clot paraffin specimens from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (classified according to criteria of the World Health Organization; n = 49), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 4), precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 4), ES/PNET (n = 1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (n = 3) with MIC2 (CD99) and TdT immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, CD99 was expressed in 24 (49%) of 49 AML cases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (11/11) TdT-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD99 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> except M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow specimens were uniformly CD99 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of TdT was limited to a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M0, -M1, -M2, and -M4, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study, CD99 expression was not restricted to TdT-positive hematologic proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In particular, the CD99-positive M3 and M7 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> were TdT negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An M5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may likely be excluded based on a uniform TdT-negative/CD99-negative immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, in our experience, CD99 should be routinely evaluated on bone marrow clots, owing to decreased reactivity or loss of reactivity in rapid decalcifying (RDO) solution-decalcified specimens </plain></SENT>
