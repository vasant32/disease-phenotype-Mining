<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, G banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization for 5q were performed, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with 5q deletion, the deleted region on chromosome 5 was mapped with fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGR1, CSF1R, and PDGFRB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">del(5q) syndrome</z:e> and 5q deletion was 2.2% (3 of 137 patients) and 15.3% (21 of 137 patients), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) groups were low risk (5.8%), intermediate 1 (51.1%), intermediate 2 (27.8%), and high risk (15.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with del(5q) were significantly older (62 years) and showed an unfavorable survival compared to patients without del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half (53%) of the patients with del(5q) also had complex chromosome abnormalities, including chromosome 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with del(5q), 93.3% were deleted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions on 5q, compared to 66.7% of patients with isolated del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marker chromosomes proved to be chromosome 5 with interstitial deletion of q arm by fluorescence in situ hybridization in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The biological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Korea seem to be markedly different from those of Caucasians, with Koreans having a younger age, lower frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, higher frequencies of complex cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q), and poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We infer that additional chromosome abnormalities contribute to the adverse prognostic impact in patients with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
