<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown a good response to immunosuppressive treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have treated six transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with CSA for a minimum of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these patients showed a significant response, while the drug was withdrawn in 3/6 patients because of intolerable side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two reasons for the failure of this treatment in our patients can be advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the hypoplastic variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> predominated in previous studies in contrast to ours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the concomitant use of other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> in previous studies might have enhanced the effect of CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest further therapeutic trials of CSA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, selecting patients on the basis of in vitro studies that predict an immunological basis for their disease, to assess its efficacy in prolonging survival </plain></SENT>
