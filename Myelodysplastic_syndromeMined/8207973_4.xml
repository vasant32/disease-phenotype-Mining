<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FISH data were compared with cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both methods were in agreement in 25/50 MDS and 20/20 ANLL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 11 was found neither by cytogenetic study nor by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 MDS patients the percentage of abnormal cells was higher by FISH than by classical cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 which was undetectable by karyotypic study in 5-22% cells from 15 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also allowed the identification of two small markers and a ring chromosome in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH hence appears to be useful for the detection of minor abnormal clones and is a convenient complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
