<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present some retrospective data on the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in Romania, in a large but well-defined territory and over a long period of time, as reflected by a large single-hospital based Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The registration forms provided by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Foundation were filled in with the data of the new adult primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients admitted in the Hematological Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, during 1985-2004 and classified according to French-American-British (FAB) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study comprised 306 patients accrued from a delimited geo-administrative zone, 137 (45%) from Bucharest and 169 (55%) from the rest of the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results revealed male predominance, obvious increase of the crude and â‰¥60 years age group specific incidence temporal trend, nonnegligible proportion of the &lt;50 years age group, similar distribution and temporal trend of both rural/urban areas and gender in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included counties, and no geographical and familial clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increase of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence in Romania appears not to be related to the ageing of the population but rather to: 1) the increasing addressability to health care of the elderly; 2) the greater awareness of the physicians on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 3) the expansion of the hematological laboratories network; 4) the increasing number of hematologists and oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methodology used in this work, using a comprehensive analysis of the standard population, can allow a better comparison of the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registries of an European or regional network and of the data of the same Registry from different time intervals </plain></SENT>
