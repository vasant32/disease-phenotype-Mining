<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the outcome of second HSCT for treatment of patients with relapsed, refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 72 patients were eligible for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 25 (35%) patients received salvage chemotherapy prior to the second transplant procedure and only two (3%) patients were in complete remission at the time of the second transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients (28%) had low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden as measured by the absence of peripheral blood blasts and &lt;or=5% blasts in the bone marrow at the time of the second transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although, the overall median survival after the second transplant was 6 months, a subset of patients who had low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden at the time of the second transplant had a 5-year survival of 25 vs 12% in those with a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a second transplant may offer the possibility of long-term disease control in a subset of patients who have a 'low bulk' disease at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
