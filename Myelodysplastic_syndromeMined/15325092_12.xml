<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have performed a cytogenetic analysis of 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with complex karyotypes (CK) using GTG-banding and spectral karyotyping techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of cases were hypodiploid, 34% were hyperdiploid, and 11% were pseudodiploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most recurrent alterations were <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosomes 18, 5, and 7; <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8; and deletion of 5q, 11q, and 12p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two structural alterations were mostly identified as unbalanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes and regions more frequently affected were 16q12, 17p11, and 20q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 92 structural alterations were reciprocal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two translocations were recurrent, t(X;20)(p11.4;q11.2) and der(17)t(5;17)(?;p11.2); each one was present in about 10% of cases (2 cases, t[X:20] and 3 cases, t[5:17]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations of TP53 were observed in five cases (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with rearrangements affecting 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total or partial inactivation of TP53 was detected in six cases (26%) as a result of loss of either both copies (four cases) or just one copy (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed amplification of genes previously identified in myeloid and/or hematological processes, such as HER2neu, MLL, and AML1, which could represent frequent events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with CK </plain></SENT>
