<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retrospective studies suggested a high propensity for malignant myeloid transformation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study's aims were to determine the cellular and molecular characteristics as well as the clinical course of malignant myeloid transformation and clonal marrow disease in patients with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a longitudinal prospective study of 14 patients recruited for annual hematological evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of baseline and serial hematological assessments for up to 5 years are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clonal marrow cytogenetic abnormalities (CMCA) were detected in 4 patients (29%) on first testing or at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were del(20q) in two patients, i(7q) in one, and combined del(20q) and i(7q) in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following tests did not distinguish patients with CMCA from other <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients: severity of peripheral cytopenia, fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, percentage of marrow CD34+ cells, colony growth from marrow CD34+ cells, cluster-to-colony ratio, marrow stromal function, percentage of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cells, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and p53 mutation analysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blast colony assays were uniformly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients showed progression into more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the abnormal clone became undetectable after 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although CMCA in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> is high, progression into advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may be slow and difficult to predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment should be cautious since some abnormal clones can regress </plain></SENT>
