<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that genomic alterations of cells in the hematopoietic microenvironment could induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with ineffective hematopoiesis and dysmorphic hematopoietic cells, and subsequent transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation is the first attempt to correlate the gene expression profile of AURKA and AURKB in a cytogenetically stratified population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that AURKA <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> was expressed at significantly higher levels in MSCs even with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/altered karyotype when compared with hematopoietic cells and healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities (mainly <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) in hematopoietic cells/MSCs was also associated with higher levels of AURKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different from previous investigations, our findings, regarding AURKA expression support the hypothesis that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in MSCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not a consequence of the method used for chromosome preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They may reflect the genomic instability present in the bone marrow microenvironment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This information is also supported by differences observed in the growth kinetics between MSCs from healthy donors (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype) and from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results may not be considered evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MSCs are originated from a single neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, both cells (hematopoietic and MSCs) may probably be altered in response to damage-inducing factors, and the presence of genomic abnormalities in MSCs suggests that an unstable bone marrow microenvironment may facilitate the expansion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
