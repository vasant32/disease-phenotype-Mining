<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to analyze the autonomous proliferative capacity of leukemic progenitors in both de novo and secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> and to correlate with clinical and biological characteristics of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assays with and without leukocyte conditioned medium with PHA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>-PHA) were performed and the autonomous proliferation index (API) calculated in a series of 50 patients (34 de novo ANLL, eight secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and eight secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to their API, low (&lt; or = 0.4) or high (&gt; 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autonomous growth was observed in 84% of cases studied (82% in de novo ANLL, 75% secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 100% secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group with the highest API (29 patients) had increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P = 0.006) and platelets (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high API was also associated with an immature phenotype of blast cells (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon analyzing the de novo ANLL separately we observed that a high API correlated with high Hb values (P = 0.02), a lower rate of complete remission (42% vs 61%) and a lower survival rate (medium of 3 vs 10 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the capacity for autonomous proliferation can condition the clinical and biological profile of the disease </plain></SENT>
