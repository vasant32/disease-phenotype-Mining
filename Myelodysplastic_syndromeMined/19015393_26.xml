<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WM patients with less than 2 prior therapies were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intended therapy consisted of 6 cycles (25 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days) of fludarabine and 8 infusions (375 mg/m(2) per week) of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 43 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were: complete response (n = 2), very good partial response (n = 14), partial response (n = 21), and minor response (n = 4), for overall and major response rates of 95.3% and 86.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 51.2 months and was longer for untreated patients (P = .017) and those achieving at least a very good partial response (P = .049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or higher toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 27), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 7), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 6), including 2 patients who died of non-Pneumocystis carinii <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 40.3 months, we observed 3 cases of transformation to aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate that fludarabine and rituximab are highly active in WM, although short- and long-term toxicities need to be carefully weighed against other available treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00020800 </plain></SENT>
