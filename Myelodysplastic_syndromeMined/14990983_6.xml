<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At Princess Margaret Hospital, every potential donor is screened with a bone marrow aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case histories of three asymptomatic potential donors who presented within 1 year with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> complete blood counts, history and physical examination are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 65-year-old male patient was diagnosed with smouldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, a 72-year-old male patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and a 42-year-old male patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination led to the diagnosis in each one of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note is that each of the potential donors was discovered to have the same disease as the transplant recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro clonogenic hemopoietic progenitor assays were compared to those of 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inferior growth of hemopoietic progenitor colonies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, particularly in older donors and donors with potential for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, more screening investigations including bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> may be reasonable to investigate for occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> prior to stem cell donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assays can contribute to detect hemopoietic abnormalities pre transplant </plain></SENT>
