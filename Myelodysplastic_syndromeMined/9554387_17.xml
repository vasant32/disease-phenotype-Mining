<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We determined which factors portend a higher risk of renal deterioration in the myelodysplastic child, and evaluated the sensitivity and predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical history, imaging studies and urodynamics of 90 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>spinal dysraphism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median patient age at initial evaluation was 3 months and average followup ranged between 2 and 25 years (average 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relation of urodynamic parameters and sex to upper tract changes and the resolution of these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant relationships were identified between the urodynamic parameters of leak point pressure, compliance and detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo>, and renal deterioration but not with resolution of deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Boys and girls did not demonstrate a significant difference among urodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients had a higher incidence of reflux and parenchymal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With knowledge of the inherent sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of urodynamic parameters, selective use of urodynamics will assist in identifying patients at risk of renal deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female patients with reflux are at greatest risk of parenchymal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We advocate early institution of intermittent catheterization in patients identified as high risk for deterioration by urodynamics </plain></SENT>
