<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Leukemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was dynamically followed up and the clinical manifestations, peripheral blood and bone marrow pictures, karyotypes, immunophenotypes, response to treatment and prognosis of post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (postMDS-AL) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the past eight year and seven months, 21 (13.91%) of 151 MDS patients progressed to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with a median interval of 5 (1 - 21) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transformation was developed either gradually or rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were five parameters related to the leukemic transformation: under 40 years of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, more than 0.15 blasts in bone marrow, at least two types of abnormal karyotype and combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 21 post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-AL were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); and most of them were M(2), M(4) and M(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two (9.52%) post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> developed extramedullary infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> was found in 47.62% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two third of the patients, whose bone marrows were generally hypercellular, showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After evolving into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 8 (47.06%) patients developed abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High expression of immature myeloid antigens, including CD(33) (49.83 +/- 24.50)%, CD(13) (36.38 +/- 33.84)%, monocytic antigen CD(14) (38.50 +/- 24.60)%, and stem cell marker CD(34) (34.67 +/- 30.59)% were found on bone marrow mononuclear cells of post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In some cases, lymphoid antigens, such as CD(5), CD(7), CD(9) and CD(19) were coexisted with myeloid antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A low complete remission rate (31.25%) and short survival duration with median survival of 6 (1 - 28) months were found in patients with post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> treated by induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was at high risk of evolving into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, either gradually or rapidly </plain></SENT>
