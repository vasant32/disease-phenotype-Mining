<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A good relationship between the reference method and the STKS results was shown in 200 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both sensitivity and reliability of alarms were evaluated in both groups </plain></SENT>
