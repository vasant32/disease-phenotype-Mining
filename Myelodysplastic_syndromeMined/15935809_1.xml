<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning (CBP) can be found among workers with excessive <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBP could give the appearance of different types of disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper describes 43 CBP cases with the patients' ages ranging from 18 to 36 years (average: 23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 13 (30%) were male and 30 (70%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their job titles were furniture maker, shoemaker, industrial painter and metal shop worker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their work durations ranged from 1.5 to 72 months (average: 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> levels in these workplaces exceeded 30 mg/m3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 43 cases (23%) were diagnosed as mild cases of CBP, another 10 (23%) were moderate, and 23 (53%) were severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment for CBP included the following: cessation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure, general supportive therapy, antibiotics, vitamins, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF), blood component therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (77%) of the cases recovered completely, nine (21%) cases improved, and one (2%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In general, prognosis of CBP cases is optimistic when appropriate treatment is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, a few of the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced AA cases showed no response to treatment, which raises questions about the traditional view of the pathogenesis of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only a part of the population with the same level of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure would suffer from the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Still, CBP cases with the same <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure level exhibited different extents of severity of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests strongly the existence of individual susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Detection of the biological markers regarding the individual susceptibility would be valuable for screening workers who are not suitable to be exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
