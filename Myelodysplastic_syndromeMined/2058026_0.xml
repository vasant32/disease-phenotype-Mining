<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these disorders is monoclonality, i.e. they originate from one single cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Around 2,000 new cases are diagnosed per year in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the relative small number of patients, complex diagnosis and treatment (especially the possibility of cure on intensive treatment) a high degree of centralization is warranted to secure an evenly distributed high level of patient care and research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present rules for referral of patients are unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new referral system is proposed based on a common set of rules, agreed upon by five haematological centers in Denmark and the surrounding region, comprising diagnostic procedures, treatment, research and development for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> haematological patients in the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these common rules (functional centralization) it is decided whether the individual patient can be treated in the primary hospital or should be referred to a center (geographical centralization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recommendations about diagnosis, treatment and referral are made in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detailed suggestions are given for diseases which may be treated locally whereas no detailed regimens are given for diseases and disease stages which should be centralized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter cases, the main emphasis is placed on a presentation of treatment results </plain></SENT>
