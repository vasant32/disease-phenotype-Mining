<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of topotecan (TPT) on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell growth was measured by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of apoptotic cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the antitumor effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells in xenotransplanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice was evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot was used for determining the expression of topoisomerase I (Top1) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The growth of Mutz-1 cells was suppressed by TPT treatment in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 50% inhibition in Mutz-1 cell growth (IC(50)) of TPT for 72 h was 272 ng/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of apoptotic cells observed in the Mutz-1 cells after exposure to TPT (160 ng/L) in 48 h and 72 h was (54.16 +/-4.29)% and (72.97+/-6.12)%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TEM showed the characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Mutz-1 cells treated with TPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The xenotransplanted <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice treated with TPT showed inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TPT treatment resulted in a longer survival as compared with the control group (P&lt;0.001) and with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi>-treated group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cells exposed to TPT exhibited a time-dependent decrease of Top1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TPT can inhibit Mutz-1 cell growth and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro.The downregulation of Top1 may be involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by TPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TPT has a significant antitumor effect in vivo </plain></SENT>
