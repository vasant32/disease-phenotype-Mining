<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: fifty-five patients with diagnosis fitting to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with Qinghuang Powder and decoction for strengthening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and reinforcing Shen, in combination with Stanozololum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients (20.0%) out of the 55 were completely remitted (CR), the total effective rate being 74.5% (41/55 cases) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5%) in the 34 patients of type RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were CR, with the total effective rate of 82.4% (28/34 cases), and in the 21 patients of type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 9.5% (2/21 cases) were CR with the total effective rate of 61.9% (13/21 cases), showing insignificant statistical difference between the two types (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), the treatment was evaluated as CR in 10 patients, effective in 25 and ineffective in 11 in 36 patients of moderate risk group I , the responding numbers were 1, 4, 2 in 7 patients of moderate risk group II and 0, 3, 3 in 6 patients of high risk group, respectively, also showing insignificant difference between groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By cytogenetics, the effective rate was 68.8% (11/16 cases) in patients with abnormal chromosome and 72.7% (24/33 cases) in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome, with insignificant difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The comprehensive therapy with TCM treatment for reinforcing Shen and dissolving stasis in dominance has a definite clinical effect in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it was not significantly associated with FAB typing, IPSS score, and chromosome abnormality of patients </plain></SENT>
