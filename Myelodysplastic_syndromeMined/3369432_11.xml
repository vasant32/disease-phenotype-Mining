<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of clonal chromosomal abnormalities and of an excess of blasts for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (BMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided into two main groups: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> without an excess of blasts (RAWEB), grouping patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), and (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), grouping patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 29 patients with RAWEB and 14 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time of observation was 26 months for RAWEB and 12 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten RAWEB patients (34%) and 11 RAEB patients (78%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the ten RAWEB patients with clonal abnormalities, one (10%) died from ANLL, while of 19 RAWEB patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, two (10%) died from ANLL or BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with RAWEB and an abnormal karyotype was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, eight of the 11 RAEB patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities (74%) died from ANLL or BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival in this sub-group was 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By using a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, it was determined that a karyotype abnormality was not a significant predictory of survival once the contribution of the RAWEB/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> variable was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Being in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> group was associated with a relative risk of 10.6 of dying from ANLL or BMF (beta = 2.36, standard error (SE) = 0.68, P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that classifying patients according to an excess of blasts will lead to a better prediction of survival than determining karyotype abnormality </plain></SENT>
