<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and particularly in patients categorized as lower risk (&lt; 10% blasts or low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS]) is very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and includes patients with very different outcomes with current scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new cytogenetic classification has been proposed for the revised IPSS in predicting the outcome for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the prognostic significance of multiple variables for survival and risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, we analyzed baseline characteristics of 332 lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients within the lower risk cytogenetic categories by IPSS and the recent proposal for the new cytogenetic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, severity of cytopenias, age &gt; 60 years, bone marrow blasts (5%-9%) and transfusion dependency significantly influenced outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of these variables allowed development of a model which categorizes patients in 3 different groups with median survival of 95, 44, and 13 months for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, this score also stratified patients for their risk for leukemic progression, estimated at 2 years in 3.1%, 7.6%, and 21.3% for each group (P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although karyotype remains the main prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the current study identifies clinical parameters predicting outcome among patients with the better cytogenetic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Degree of cytopenias, blasts 5%-9% and transfusion dependence might identify a subset of patients within the nonadverse karyotype, in which early or more aggressive approaches could possibly be required to improve survival or prevent disease progression </plain></SENT>
