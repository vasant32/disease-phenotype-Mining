<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detected TET2 mutations and assayed its catalyzing conversion product 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in 61 Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were identified to have TET2 mutations (16.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5-hmC levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with TET2 mutations were significantly lower than in those without mutations, and CD34+ cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibited a lower 5-hmC content than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TET2 expression and 5-hmC in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with P15 methylation were both significantly lower than in those without P15 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not observe a correlation between TET2 mutations and overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with higher 5-hmC levels or in lower risk groups of the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) had a longer overall survival, suggesting that 5-hmC levels may be a new molecular marker for prognostic assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that revised IPSS criteria are also applicable to the risk categories of Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
