<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The longer-survival periods (F = 25.11, P &lt; 0.01) with lower toxicity were only observed in lower-dose group of ATO 5.0 microg than in other treated groups and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>THAL alone group had a mild inhibitory effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors growth</z:e> (&gt; 2 weeks) with a longer-survival period and higher-rate of survival than controls, but had no events of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and CD34 protein and MVD were markedly down-regulated by THAL compared with control groups (P &lt; 0.01), suggesting that the possible mechanisms of the inhibitory effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> by THAL related to inhibition of vascular endothelial growth </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect of ATO were considered to be related to inducing cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but in the case of THAL, related to inhibition of vascular endothelial growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>(3) The results do not support the preconceived hypothesis of a synergistic effect of ATO (7.5 microg) in combination with THAL for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mice model due to the more intense toxicity and the shorter-survival periods in the treated group </plain></SENT>
