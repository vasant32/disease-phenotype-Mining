<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once an underlying cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> is excluded, the diagnosis of CNL is based on exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classification proposed by Sheperd et al. has proven to be helpful, but it must be completed by cytogenetic analysis and the search for bcr rearrangement by molecular biology methods, in order to confirm the absence of Philadelphia chromosome and of bcr-abl hybrid gene </plain></SENT>
