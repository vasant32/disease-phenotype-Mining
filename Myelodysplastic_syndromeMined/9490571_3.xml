<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> a high concentration of sTfRs in serum could be explained with an increased expression of transferrin receptors on the erythroblastic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> a discrepancy between a low expression on the cell membrane and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated serum values was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this study we conclude that the concentration of sTfRs in serum does not only depend on the expression of transferrin receptors on the erythroblasts but also on the erythroid activity </plain></SENT>
