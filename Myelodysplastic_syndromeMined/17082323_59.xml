<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase 2 study, we tested the oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in 158 older adults with previously untreated, poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 74 years, and a majority of patients had antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 22 patients (14%); partial remission or hematologic improvement occurred in 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CR was 7.3 months and the median survival of complete responders was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse karyotype, age 75 years or older, and poor performance status correlated negatively with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the absence of progressive disease was rare, and drug-related nonhematologic serious adverse events were observed in 74 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of farnesylation of the surrogate protein HDJ-2 occurred in the large majority of marrow samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline levels of phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and AKT did not correlate with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tipifarnib is active and well tolerated in older adults with poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and may impart a survival advantage in those patients who experience a clinical response </plain></SENT>
