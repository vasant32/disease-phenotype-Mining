<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, no information is available on its use in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reported two children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> detected by 64-channel MDCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient probably had fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique showed a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> with a small left kidney in the first patient and a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MDCTA is an accurate and noninvasive imaging technique, easily performed in children, and can be used as an alternative diagnostic modality in children with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
