<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven (67%) had a clone with an abnormal karyotype at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormal karyotypes in the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 64.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During subsequent follow-up, five patients acquired chromosome abnormalities; thus, at the end of the study, 72.0% of patients had an abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 5q-, +8, -7, -5, and -22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (i.e., 70% of those with an abnormal karyotype and 47% of the whole group) had one of the karyotype abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; in other words, 5q- or -5, or -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 21.1% progressed into ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable prognostic factors associated with the risk of evolution into ANLL and with shorter overall survival were the presence of greater than 5% of bone marrow blasts, major chromosome abnormalities, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
