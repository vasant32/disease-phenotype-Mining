<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies showed the benefit of purging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) stem cell transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that purging by positive selection of CD34+ and CD133+ cells resulted in a 3-4 log <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell reduction (TCR) in CD34- and/or CD133- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but has been shown to be potentially applicable in only about 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar to CD34 and CD133, CD90 marks the hematopoietic CD34 positive stem cells capable of full hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy, and therefore, in the present study, we explored whether a similar purging approach is possible using CD90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD90 expression was established by flowcytometry in diagnosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> on the clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> CD34+ blast population by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity was defined as &gt;3% CD90 (CD34+) expression on blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the calculation of the efficacy of TCR by positive selection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts were recognized by either prelabeling diagnosis blasts with CD45-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> in spiking model experiments or using expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated marker combinations both in spiking experiments and in real transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 119 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, we found coexpression of CD34 and CD90 (&gt;3%) in 42 cases (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients 60 years or younger, representing the patients who are eligible for transplantation, only 23% (16/69) of the patients showed CD90 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive selection for CD90 in transplants containing CD90 negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> resulted in a 2.8-4 log TCR in the models used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Purging by positive selection using CD90 can potentially be applied effectively in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients 60 years or younger </plain></SENT>
