<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 141 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 131) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 10) who underwent allogeneic transplantation with fludarabine (Flu)/melphalan (Mel)-based regimens and hypothesized that moderate to mild renal function impairment increases NRM in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flu dose consisted of 25-30 mg/m(2) for 4 days and Mel dose was 100-180 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-compatible siblings (n = 69) and matched unrelated donors (n = 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease status at transplantation was complete remission (n = 56, 40%) or active disease (n = 85, 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured before transplantation on outcomes was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFR was estimated by both the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and the modified diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> (MDRD) equations, using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> value obtained prior to starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluated outcomes were overall survival (OS), NRM, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 and 1-year posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age was 55 years (range: 21-74 years); 59% of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Estimated GFR by CG was &gt; or =90 for 45 (32%), 60-89 for 78 (55%), and &lt;60 for 18 (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When estimated by MDRD, GFR was &gt; or =90 for 65 (46%), 60-89 from 66 (47%), and &lt;60 for 10 (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients by both estimations had a GFR between 60 and 89 (n = 78 by CG and n = 66 by MDRD) with no difference in the evaluated outcomes between this group and the subgroup of patients with a GFR &lt;60 (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in OS and NRM at day 100 and 1-year posttransplantation in the 3 groups by any GFR estimation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a mild to moderate decrease in GFR was not associated with an increase in NRM </plain></SENT>
