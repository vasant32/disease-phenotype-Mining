<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expansion of regulatory T cells occurs in high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and correlates with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>, have been shown to increase the survival of high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not entirely clear whether this improvement in patient survival is related to the effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on the immune system and/or the direct effect of these drugs on the dysplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on the function and proliferation capability of regulatory T cells and T helper cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Design and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and function of CD4+ T cell subsets in 68 intermediate-2/high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients were serially assessed at diagnosis and following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in-vitro effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on CD4+ T cell subsets isolated from both healthy donors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of peripheral blood regulatory T cells was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients compared with healthy donors and responders to treatment (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absolute numbers of T-helper 1 and T-helper 2, but not T-helper 17, cells were significantly reduced following 12 months of treatment (p=0.03, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in vitro addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> to CD4+ T cells reduced the proliferative capacity of regulatory T cells (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>-treated regulatory T cells had reduced suppressive function and produced larger amounts of IL-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The FOXP3 expression in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>-treated T effectors was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these FOXP3+/IL-17+ cells originated mainly from effector T cells rather than regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> has profound effects on CD4+ T cells, which correlate with disease status post treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite the demethylation of the FOXP3 promoter and increased FOXP3 expression following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment, these phenotypic 'regulatory T cells-like cells' lack the regulatory function and cytokine profile of regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings are important in correlating the clinically relevant immunomodulatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
