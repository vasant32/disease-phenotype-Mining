<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> and a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004445'>elliptocytosis</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">Sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) of erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed that the patient's band 4.1 was decreased to about 50-70% of that of control and contained abnormal molecule migrating in a faster mobility than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> band 4.1, which was confirmed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The actin/spectrin ratio of the patient's ghosts diminished to about 70% of that of control ghosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flowcytometric analysis showed that the glycophorin C content of the patient's erythrocytes was reduced but maintained the level of about 70% of that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indicating that the glycophorin C-band 4.1 interaction might not be so seriously damaged as to cause elliptocytic shape change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the abnormal band 4.1 produced from the abnormal erythroid clone may be the primary molecular defect and result in a dysregulation of spectrin-actin interaction to cause erythrocyte shape change and membrane instability </plain></SENT>
