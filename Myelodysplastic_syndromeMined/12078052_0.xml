<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 112 febrile(more than 38 degrees C) patients suspected of having <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and 170 samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was obtained aseptically before administering antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood culture and endotoxin assays were performed simultaneously with these materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma endotoxin levels were positive in 64 samples when the cut off index was postulated at 0.35 pg/ml, while only 5 samples when the cut off index was postulated at 5 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the cut off index was at 0.35 pg/ml, sensitivity was 86%, while it was 14% when the cut off index was 5 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> rods(GNR) were detected by blood culture in 14 cases and the average period to detect GNR was 14.8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of circulating viable bacteria is diagnosed by blood culture, but because of the serious consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, treatment is initiated even in the absence of an identifiable organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since plasma endotoxin level can be assayed in about 2 hours, it will be more practical if we adjust the cut off index according to the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
