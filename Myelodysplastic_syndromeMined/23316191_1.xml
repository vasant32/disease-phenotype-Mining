<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides their known effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, there is growing evidence for modulation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs(Â®)) play an important role in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and have already demonstrated antitumor, anti-angiogenic, and immunostimulating effects, in particular on natural killer (NK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> are directly targeting different kinases and are known to regulate effector NK cells and expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demethylating agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> interfere with the epigenetic regulation and protein degradation of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are first hints that these drugs also sensitize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to chemotherapy, radiation, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by enhanced expression of TRAIL and NKG2DLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these pharmaceuticals may also impair NK cell function in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this review provides an update on the effects of different novel molecules on the immune system focusing NK cells </plain></SENT>
