<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To perform a comprehensive assessment of the late effects of short-term intensive chemotherapy for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and compare the sequelae of intensive chemotherapy alone with those of total-body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 33 survivors studied, 26 (group A) received intensive chemotherapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, one also received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Bu/Cy), and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (group B) received chemotherapy, TBI, and BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearing, sight, growth, and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, renal, and cardiac function were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean height standard deviation score of 25 nontransplanted group A patients was +0.67 at diagnosis, -0.11 following treatment (P = .016), and +0.34 7 years later (P &gt; .05), indicating no long-term growth impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gonadal function and the girls had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uterine size and ovarian volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bu/Cy patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001587'>primary ovarian failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four group B children required growth hormone and four sex steroids for growth or gonadal failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The girls had <z:mp ids='MP_0002637'>reduced uterine size</z:mp> and ovarian volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three had thyroid dysfunction and six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of renal function were found in both groups and hearing loss in group A only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean cardiac shortening fraction was significantly reduced at 29.2% in group A and 28.6% in group B compared with 36% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two group A patients have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy and TBI before BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> has resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth failure</z:hpo>, gonadal and thyroid damage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> in most children, whereas chemotherapy alone caused cardiac, renal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000364'>hearing abnormalities</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
