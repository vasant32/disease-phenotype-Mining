<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is also the case for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, a frequent complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only treatment capable of providing long-term remission (in about 1 in 2 patients on average) is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but this burdensome treatment can only be used in a minority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> (Vidaza, Celgene), an agent that blocks DNA synthesis, is the first drug to receive EU marketing authorisation in these settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its clinical evaluation is based on an unblinded trial that included 358 patients comparable to those discussed in the marketing authorisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to individually tailored symptomatic care, they were randomised to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> or conventional care regimens chosen by their physician (no treatment, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, or an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival time was significantly longer with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (24.5 versus 15 months), and transfusion requirements were also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another comparative trial versus symptomatic treatment alone in 191 patients with various prognoses also showed an increase in survival time with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, but this study suffered from methodological flaws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> are potentially severe toxicity for various blood cells, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>, and reactions at the injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In practice, when haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not feasible for poor-prognosis patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or related disorders, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> can be used instead of disappointing standard treatments, even though more clinical evaluation is needed </plain></SENT>
