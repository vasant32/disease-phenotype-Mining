<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most lethal type of DNA damage are double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which are mainly repaired by Non Homologous End Joining Mechanism (NHEJ), whose core enzyme components include the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4 and DNA Ligase IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was the analysis of expression of proteins required for NHEJ in bone marrow cells of adult de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and their association with clinical characteristics and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our analysis included 48 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 19 RA, 5 RARS, 19 RAEB, 3 RAEB-T, 1 CMML, 1 transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> according to FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the enzymes Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, DNA-PKcs and Ligase IV was determined by Western Blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean Ligase IV expression value was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.53 vs. 0.78, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was found between karyotype risk group and Ligase IV values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Ku70 expression levels were significantly lower in patients with a good prognosis karyotype (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a negative correlation between Ku70 expression values and Hb levels was observed (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, a positive correlation was observed between enzyme Ku70 expression values and level of blasts (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suppor-t a potential role of NHEJ enzyme Ligase IV in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Larger numbers of cases need to be screened in order to draw definite conclusion </plain></SENT>
