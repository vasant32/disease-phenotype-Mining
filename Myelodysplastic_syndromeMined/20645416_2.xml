<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previously published series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases, which had lost this region via unbalanced translocation, around 40% of cases were shown to have additional copies of the chromosome 20 abnormalities, with resulting gain or amplification of the retained parts of chromosome 20, most often 20q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used FISH and array comparative genomic hybridization, to define further the retained and amplified regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report targeted amplification of 20q11.21 in four of the 22 cases selected for further study and in one new case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The shortest amplified region of 250 kb in a series of five patients with three to ten copies of the 20q11.21 region contained the complete HCK, TM9SF4, PLAGL2, and POFUT1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By RT-PCR we have shown that there is correlation between amplification and increased expression of these four genes in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Localized and high level amplification of the common 250 kb region is evidence for activation of an oncogene in this region in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases with 20q11.21 amplification tended to have a high proportion of erythroblasts in the marrow, with two cases diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML-M6</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome sub-band 20q11.21 amplification may therefore prove to be a marker of a specific subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> with a significant erythroid component </plain></SENT>
