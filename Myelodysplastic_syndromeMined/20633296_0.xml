<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microarray technology has permitted a refined high-throughput mapping of the transcriptional activity in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (ncRNAs) transcribed from intronic regions of genes are involved in a number of processes related to post-transcriptional control of gene expression, and in the regulation of exon-skipping and intron retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of ncRNAs in progenitor cells and stromal cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients could be strategic for understanding gene expression regulation in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, gene expression profiles of CD34+ cells of 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) subgroup and stromal cells of 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> were compared with healthy individuals using 44 k combined intron-exon oligoarrays, which included probes for exons of protein-coding genes, and for non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> transcribed from intronic regions in either the sense or antisense strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm the expression levels of selected transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD34+ cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients, 216 genes were significantly differentially expressed (q-value &lt;or= 0.01) in comparison to healthy individuals, of which 65 (30%) were non-coding transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stromal cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 12 genes were significantly differentially expressed (q-value &lt;or= 0.05) in comparison to healthy individuals, of which 3 (25%) were non-coding transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated, for the first time, the differential ncRNA expression profile between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and healthy individuals, in CD34+ cells and stromal cells, suggesting that ncRNAs may play an important role during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
