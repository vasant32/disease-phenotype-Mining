<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry staining and Wright-Giemsa staining of BMMNC from 75 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 11 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 13 cases of non-leukemic patients and 9 healthy adults were performed, and the CD73(+) ratio in BMMNC and its relationship with differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells were analyzed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of CD73 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subtype, differentiation and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the lower of CD73 expression in myeloid and B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> does not meet this pattern </plain></SENT>
