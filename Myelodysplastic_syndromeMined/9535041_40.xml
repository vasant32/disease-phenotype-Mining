<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Within a prospective study we analyzed hematopoietic chimerism in serial peripheral blood samples taken from 55 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL 21, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 20, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 14) with a median age of 13.5 years at very short time intervals following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation was performed to determine the implications of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) with regard to the clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> after allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of chimerism was performed by PCR of variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences with a maximum sensitivity of 0.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen male patients transplanted with the marrow of a female donor were also studied by amplification of a Y-chromosome-specific alphoid repeat (0.1-0.01% sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VNTR analysis in 55 patients revealed complete chimerism (CC) in 36 cases, MC in 18 follow-ups and autologous recovery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of MC identified 10/18 patients with increasing autologous patterns in whom 9/10 subsequently relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient with autologous recovery relapsed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 18 patients with MC showed decreasing amounts of autologous DNA and became CC upon further follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 7/36 patients with CC in the prior analysis of chimerism status relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in 4/7 patients the interval between last CC confirmation and relapse was more than 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2/7 patients autologous DNA was not detectable in peripheral blood but in bone marrow aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of these seven patients developed a fulminant relapse within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probability of relapse-free survival for patients with CC is 0.67 (n = 36), for patients with decreasing MC 1.0 (n = 8) and for patients with increasing MC 0.1 (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results demonstrate that serial and quantitative chimerism analysis at short time intervals by PCR provides a reliable and rapid screening method for the early detection of recurrence of underlying disease and is therefore a prognostic tool to identify patients at highest risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
