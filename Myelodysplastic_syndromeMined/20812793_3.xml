<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A UK National Health Service perspective was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>elevated serum ferritin</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An economic model was used to extrapolate the clinical benefits of iron chelation therapy (ICT) in a cohort of lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs for drug acquisition, drug administration and monitoring, and quality of life (utility) outcomes associated with mode of drug administration were derived from a variety of sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost per QALY gained for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% in line with UK standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The base-case cost effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> was estimated to be £20,822 per QALY gained, the key driver being the additional quality of life benefits associated with a simpler mode of administration for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean survival benefit for both forms of ICT of 4.5 years was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results were sensitive to drug dose, days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> administration, and patient weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, a cost per QALY below £20,000-30,000 is considered cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, the results from this economic analysis suggest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> is cost effective in lower risk, transfusion-dependent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Limitations with the analysis include a lack of comparative randomised controlled trial evidence, in particular to differentiate survival and clinical outcomes for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
