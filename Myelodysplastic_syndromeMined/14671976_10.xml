<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were reported that had unusual, distinct monocytic nodules in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The monocytic nodules, predominantly composed of monocytes with CD68+ immunostaining, had no or low expression of Ki-67 and topoisomerase II alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to further define the associated clinical diseases, histologic features, and immunohistochemical characteristics of 21 such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant hematopathologic slides of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were reviewed, and extensive immunohistochemical staining was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (15/21 [71%]) had <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> in the bone marrow, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was the most commonly associated clinical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, the monocytic nodules also were present in lymph node, spleen, or skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining results for the monocytes in the nodules were similar to those for plasmacytoid monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study established that monocytic nodules can be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>; verified the monocytic lineage; and revealed the low proliferative state of these cells </plain></SENT>
