<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients eventually require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and consequently develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excess free iron in cells catalyzes generation of reactive oxygen species that cause <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, including oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is uncertain how iron-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> affects the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who visited our university hospital and affiliated hospitals (n=43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 13 patients received iron chelation therapy when their serum ferritin (SF) level was greater than 1000 ng/mL or they required more than 20 RBC transfusions (or 100 mL/kg of RBC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We prospectively analyzed 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before and after iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi>, administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed that the 8-OHdG levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers and were positively correlated with SF and chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the 8-OHdG levels in PBMC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients significantly decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> administration, suggesting that iron chelation reduced oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, excess iron could contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and iron chelation therapy could improve the oxidative DNA damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
