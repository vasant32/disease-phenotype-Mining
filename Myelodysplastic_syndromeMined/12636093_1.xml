<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 50 (range 15-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction regimen (FLAG-Ida) included fludarabine (30 mg/sqm), Ara-C (2 g/sqm) on days 1-5, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (10 mg/sqm) on days 1, 3, 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-CSF (300 mcg/day) was administered s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12 hours before starting fludarabine and was continued for five days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HDT with stem cell rescue was planned for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in first CR after one course of high dose Ara-C (HDAC) consolidation and in good clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (98%) patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died during induction (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CR was achieved in 35 patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients, 66% of those achieving CR, underwent autologous (N = 17) or allogeneic (N = 6) transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow up of 24 months, the average median duration of CR is 17 months (range 3-66) and the median survival is 20 months (range 1-83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall the 5 year projected disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 37% and 43%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients who underwent stem cell transplantation DFS and OS were 53% and 69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median time to PMN recovery (&gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 17 days (range 10-28) and 50 x 10(9)/l platelets were reached at a median of 17 days (12-38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion FLAG-Ida regimen is effective, low toxic and improves feasibility of stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
