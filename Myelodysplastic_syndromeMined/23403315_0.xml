<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the bone marrow has been associated with the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein investigated the involvement of toll-like receptors and their endogenous ligands in the induction/maintenance of the inflammatory process in the marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design-Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression of toll-like receptors in marrow monocytes of patients (n=27) and healthy controls (n=25) by flow-cytometry and also assessed the activation of the respective signaling using a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the high mobility group box-1 protein, a toll-like receptor-4 ligand, in marrow plasma and long-term bone marrow culture supernatants by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and we performed cross-over experiments using marrow plasma from patients and controls in the presence/absence of a toll-like receptor-4 inhibitor to evaluate the pro-inflammatory cytokine production by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the apoptotic cell clearance capacity of patient macrophages using a fluorescence microscopy-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found over-expression of toll-like receptor-4 in patient marrow monocytes compared to controls that was associated with up-modulation of 53 genes related to the respective signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incubation of patient monocytes with autologous, but not with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, marrow plasma resulted in over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, an effect that was abrogated by the toll-like receptor-4 inhibitor suggesting that the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is largely mediated through toll-like-receptor-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High mobility group box-1 protein levels were increased in patients' marrow plasma and culture supernatants compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient macrophages displayed impaired capacity to engulf apoptotic cells and this defect was associated with excessive release of high mobility group box-1 protein by dying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A primary apoptotic cell clearance defect of marrow macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may contribute to the induction/maintenance of the inflammatory process through aberrant release of molecules inducing toll-like receptor-4 such as high mobility group box-1 protein </plain></SENT>
