<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the multi-color flow cytometric technique, we compared cell surface antigen expression patterns on bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells which were isolated as a CD34 positive- CD45 dull positive with low side scatter intensity (CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low)) population in flow cytogram between RA (n=12) and AA (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigens analyzed in CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) mononuclear cells were: CD38 and CD71 for cell growth-related antigens, CD 33 and CD13 for myeloid and monocytoid lineage-associated antigens, CD7 and CD19 for lymphoid lineage, and CD14 for a monocytic lineage specific antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) cells in bone marrow non-erythroid mononuclear cells, and the expression frequencies of CD38, CD71, CD33 and CD13 antigens in CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) progenitors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly decreased in AA compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrows (n=7) (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in RA bone marrows the percentages of CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) cells showed wide distribution and the cell surface antigen expression patterns varied among each case: some cases showed low frequencies of CD38 and CD71 expression as well as AA, whereas the others showed high expression frequency of specific antigen(s) which may reflect the clonal expansion of an abnormal clone in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
