<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of erythroblasts with micronuclei (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>) and erythroblasts with aberrant nuclear shapes (EBAN) in bone marrow were evaluated in 60 patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and also in 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> before and after treatment, and the results were compared regarding cytogenetic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> and EBAN in bone marrow were 0.60 +/- 0.35% (mean +/- SD) and 1.2 +/- 1.1% before treatment, respectively, the former of which was higher than those obtained from 93 patients with various nonmalignant diseases (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment with antileukemic drugs, the mean values of them significantly increased 9.7 and 6.1 times from the pretreatment ones, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the yields of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> and EBAN and cytogenetic patterns, although regimens including administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> seemed to cause them more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed a consistent increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> and EBAN at the time of diagnosis irrespective of the treatment; the mean frequencies were 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>7 and 6.3 times higher than those obtained from patients with nonmalignant diseases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> and EBAN were significantly higher in patients with an abnormal karyotype than those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (p &lt; 0.05 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> and p &lt; 0.001 for EBAN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, 8 patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7q showed a marked increase of EBAN (4.7 +/- 4.4%) and EBAN (13 +/- 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings revealed that drastic changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of erythroblasts were characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and may reflect a disturbance in kinetochore/spindle microtubules, such as endoreduplication, c-mitosis or restitution, in addition to chromosome lagging </plain></SENT>
