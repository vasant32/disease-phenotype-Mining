<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that expression of the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene in transgenic mice results in an invariably fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; approximately one third of mice die due to complications of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and about two thirds progress to a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis to identify genes that might collaborate with NHD13 as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformed to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newborn NHD13 transgenic mice and littermate controls were infected with the MOL4070LTR retrovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was accelerated, suggesting a synergistic effect between the NHD13 transgene and the genes neighboring retroviral insertion events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified numerous common insertion sites located near protein-coding genes and confirmed dysregulation of a subset of these by expression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these genes were Meis1, a known collaborator of HOX and NUP98-HOX fusion genes, and Mn1, a transcriptional coactivator involved in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> through fusion with the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other putative collaborators included Gata2, Erg, and Epor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, we identified a common insertion site that was &gt;100 kb from the nearest coding gene, but within 20 kb of the miR29a/miR29b1 microRNA locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both of these miRNA were up-regulated, demonstrating that retroviral insertional mutagenesis can target miRNA loci as well as protein-coding loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data provide new insights into NHD13-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> as well as retroviral insertional mutagenesis mechanisms </plain></SENT>
