<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were compared to 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that had developed after a myelodysplastic phase (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and 17 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic hypogranulation in neutrophils, measured as a score value (G-score; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 255-300), and the percentage of pelgeroid polymorphs (ppp; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 0.5%) were studied retrospectively by reviewing the diagnostic peripheral blood smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean G-score was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (178 +/- 67.9), and in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (212 +/- 65.1), but not in ALL (275 +/- 24.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were divided by age, the elderly (greater than 60 yr) had significantly (p = 0.0001) lower mean G-score than the younger (less than 45 yr) ones; 156 +/- 64.8 v 243 +/- 41.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This age-related difference became accentuated when only patients with extreme hypogranulation (G-score less than 150) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elderly de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients also had significantly (p = 0.0057) higher mean ppp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By studying the degree of polymorph <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the peripheral blood, it seems possible to identify a subset of dysplastic elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, who might have passed a (preleukaemic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase unnoticed </plain></SENT>
