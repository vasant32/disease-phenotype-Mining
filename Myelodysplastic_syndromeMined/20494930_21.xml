<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders with a high propensity to transform into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous missense mutations in IDH1 at position R132 and in IDH2 at positions R140 and R172 have recently been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 193 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> for mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that mutations in IDH1 occurred with a frequency of 3.6% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (7 mutations in 193 patients) and 7.5% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (4 mutations in 53 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three mutations in codon R140 of IDH2 and one mutation in codon R172 were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No IDH2 R140 or R172 mutations were identified in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of IDH1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.47-6.99) and a higher rate of transformation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (67% versus 28%, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence and International Prognostic Scoring System score, IDH1 mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (HR 3.57; 95% CI 1.59-8.02; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IDH1 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and may become useful as a poor risk marker in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings await validation in prospective trials </plain></SENT>
