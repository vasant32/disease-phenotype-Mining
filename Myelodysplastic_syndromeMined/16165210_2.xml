<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rare and smallest I type CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcript with a breakpoint at nucleotide 399 of CBFbeta and at nucleotide 2134 of MYH11 was detected in the bone marrow cells by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the fusion transcript was undetectable in the pretransplant peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the stem cell damage leading to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be induced mainly by the conditioning regimen for transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together with previous reports, the I type fusion transcript is preferentially induced with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
