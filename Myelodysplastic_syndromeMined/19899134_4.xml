<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the subsequent clinical outcome was overviewed in 292 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who received allo-HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 93 (32%) showed relapse/progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cohort 1 was chosen to receive no interventions with curative intent (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cohort 2 received reinduction chemotherapy and/or donor lymphocyte infusion (n = 48), and Cohort 3 underwent a second allo-HCT (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients received reinduction chemotherapy, and 27 (43%) achieved subsequent complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar among the three cohorts (4, 15, and 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-year overall survival (OS) after relapse was significantly better in patients with a second HCT (58%) than in others (14%, Cohorts 1 and 2; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the 2-year OS did not differ between the two groups, which suggests that it is difficult to maintain CR after the second HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that reinduction chemotherapy, CR after intervention, second HCT, and longer time to post-transplant relapse were associated with improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, for patients with relapse after allo-HCT, successful reinduction chemotherapy and a second HCT may be effective for prolonging survival without excessive NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, effective measures to prevent disease progression after a second HCT clearly need to be developed </plain></SENT>
