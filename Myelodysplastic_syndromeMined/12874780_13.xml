<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AML1 is frequently affected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with 21q22 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, AML1 mutations were found in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)-M0 or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, and familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorder</z:e> with a predisposition toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through the use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we examined the AML1 gene for mutations in 241 patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, and we detected AML1 mutations in seven patients (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion was found in one patient, and point mutations in four patients, including three missense mutations, two silent mutations, and one mutation within an intron resulting in an abnormal splice acceptor site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the mutations except for one were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp> domain were found in six of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients with AML1 mutations were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three of these seven patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolved from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AML1 mutations were found in two of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M0 and two of three patients with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with AML1 mutations tended to be older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients with AML1 mutations who received stem cell transplantation (SCT) are alive, whereas the remaining three patients with mutations without SCT died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AML1 mutations in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> are infrequent, but are possibly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M0, acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, and leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These patients may have a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
