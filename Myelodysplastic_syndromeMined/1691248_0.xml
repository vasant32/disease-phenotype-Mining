<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our studies showed responsiveness of enriched hemopoietic precursors in vitro to the proliferative and granulocytic differentiative stimuli of G-CSF, generally without increased clonal self-generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These in vitro parameters correlated with in vivo hematologic responses in our Phase I and II clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study 18 patients were treated for two months with s.c. administration (0.1-3 micrograms/kg/day) of G-CSF, escalating doses every two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study indicated normalization of neutrophil courses in 16 patients and reticulocyte responses with decreased red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements in three of 12 transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow myeloid maturation improved in the responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extended treatment for additional six- to 16-month periods has indicated persisting neutrophil responses </plain></SENT>
