<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q), is the most common chromosomal abnormality found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of lenalidomide (Revlimid; Celgene, Summit, NJ) as an effective targeted therapy for low/intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a del(5q) has increased the importance of karyotyping in disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present review, the importance of an accurate cytogenetic diagnosis in del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, its impact on prognosis, and the effect it can have on the choice of treatment was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the strengths and limitations of conventional and novel cytogenetic testing techniques currently available for patients with del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A practical diagnostic algorithm was provided to help facilitate the early detection and optimal treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a del(5q) abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the gold standard for genetic testing remains metaphase karyotyping, emerging novel molecular techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization may provide clinically valuable complementary and supplemental data </plain></SENT>
