<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three were women and 66 were men (sex ratio 2:3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age ranged from 30-92 years (mean 69 years) with nine patients aged less than 50 years (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic result was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At initial study, a chromosome defect was observed in 56% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of abnormality depended on FAB subtype: 52% in RA, 100% in RA 5q-, 50% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 56% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 70% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and 44% in CMMoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent single defects were del(5q), -7/del(7q), del(20q), Y loss, and +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> entity, specific chromosome defects were not associated with particular FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) insufficiency (22%) and leukemic transformation (21%) were the most important causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of leukemic transformation increased with the number of dysplastic BM cell lineages and was also associated with karyotype complexity and the proportion of abnormal/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The longest median survivals were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (142 months) and RA/RA5q- (91 months) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survivals decreased with increasing Bournemouth score values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with three abnormal cell lineages had a median survival shorter than those with one or two abnormal lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients with complex defects had shorter survival than those with single or double defects or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between survival of NN (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), AN (abnormal/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), and AA patients or between survival of patients with del(5q), -7/del(7q), +8 or del(20q) </plain></SENT>
