<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (35 men and 19 women aged 34-92 years) were studied cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cell culture and chromosome preparation were performed according to four different protocols used in parallel: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX)-synchronized or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (TdR)-unsynchronized techniques, and presence or absence of 5637 conditioned medium (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients responded better to MTX; others had better results with TdR exposure only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of 5637 CM generally improved quantity and quality of metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic result was obtained in 53 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>60% of the patients had a chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage of abnormality varied from one French-American-British (FAB) subtype to the other: 62% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 8/13), 50% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA, 6/12), 60% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 3/5), 77% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 7/9), and 57% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL, 8/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome defects were subdivided into three categories: single, two, and complex defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosome abnormalities, either single or one of two or complex defects were del(5q) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 (13 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> or rearrangement of chromosome 8 (eight cases), total or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> or rearrangement of chromosome 7 (eight cases), Y loss (seven cases), and del(20q) (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of del(5q) in macrocytic RA, this study confirms the absence of chromosome defects specific to each FAB category of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent defects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are relatively limited, however, in terms of chromosomes involved and type of abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, these defects, mostly of deleted type, are assumed to play a specific role in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
