<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To avoid high-dose conditioning and evaluate engraftment, toxicity, and GvT reactions, we treated a group of high-risk patients with a minimal intensive conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic BSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11), <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (4) were treated with fludarabine (3 x 30 mg/m(2)) and 200 cGy total-body irradiation followed by the infusion of peripheral blood stem cells from related (28) or unrelated (6) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> or tacrolimus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetile were given posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients had advanced disease, were intensively pretreated, and had contraindications against conventional myeloablative transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (94%) had engraftment of donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> developed complete donor chimerism significantly faster than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were observed in 16 of 27 patients (59%) who had active disease at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 7 patients who were treated in remission, 5 remain free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 325 days (range 100-844) 22 patients are alive (65%, 14 CR, 4 PR, 4 PD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (6%) died of treatment-related complications and 10 patients (29%) died of progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host-disease</z:e> (GvHD) of grade II or more developed in 17 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GvHD is present in 10 of 22 patients (45%) who are alive beyond day 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity and survival in this group of high-risk patients are superior to those expected with conventional allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>GvT reactions frequently occur in conjunction with GvHD and can induce durable remissions in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
