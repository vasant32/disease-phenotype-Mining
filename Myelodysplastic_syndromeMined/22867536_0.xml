<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The E. coli expression system is commonly used for fast recombinant production of rhG-CSF at a large scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have applied a novel autoinduction method for the batch expression of rhG-CSF to study whether this new system would increase cell mass and target-protein yield compared to conventional E. coli cell culture and induction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi> β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We could demonstrate 3-fold higher culture densities and a 5-fold higher protein yield compared to IPTG induction without the need to monitor cell growth in a shortened 24 h expression procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rhG-CSF expressed in autoinduction media was successfully extracted from E. coli inclusion bodies and refolded by dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After size exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification, rhG-CSF showed similar conformation, biological activity and aggregation profile compared to the commercially available biosimilar TEVAgrastim(®) (TEVA Pharma AG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression by autoinduction is suggested as a cost- and time-effective method for rhG-CSF production </plain></SENT>
