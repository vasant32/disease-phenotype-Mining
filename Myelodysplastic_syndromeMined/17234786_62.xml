<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies involving patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> have shown the efficacy of lenalidomide by reducing and often eliminating malignant cells while restoring the bone marrow function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand these clinical observations, we investigated and compared the effects of lenalidomide and a structurally related analogue, CC-4047, on the proliferation of two different human hematopoietic cell models: the Namalwa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both compounds had antiproliferative effects on Namalwa cells and pro-proliferative effects on CD34+ cells, whereas p21WAF-1 expression was up-regulated in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Namalwa cells, the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 correlated well with the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, and CDK6 activity leading to pRb hypophosphorylation and cell cycle arrest, whereas in CD34+ progenitor cells the increase of p21WAF-1 did not inhibit proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, antiproliferation results were observed in two B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (LP-1 and U266) but interestingly not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells where a protection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, CC-4047 and lenalidomide had synergistic effects with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> [a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor] by increasing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Namalwa cells and enhancing CD34+ cell expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that lenalidomide and CC-4047 have opposite effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells and could explain, at least in part, the reduction of malignant cells and the restoration of bone marrow observed in patients undergoing lenalidomide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this study provides new insights on the cellular pathways affected by lenalidomide and CC-4047, proposes new potential clinical uses, such as bone marrow regeneration, and suggests that the combination of lenalidomide or CC-4047 with certain HDAC inhibitors may elevate the therapeutic index in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
