<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By multi-color flow cytometric analysis using monoclonal antibody (mAb), APO2.7, which detects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> 7A6 antigen specifically expressed by cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we further investigated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing effect of VK2 on minor populations of leukemic blast cells in bone marrow from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and overt myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limiting dilution of CD95 (anti-Fas) mAb-treated apoptotic Jurkat cells with nonapoptotic CTB-1 cells revealed that APO2.7-positive Jurkat cells were consistently detectable by flow cytometry when present at levels of at least 5% in the CTB-1 suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patient samples the gating area for leukemic clone was determined using cell surface antigen-specific mAbs conjugated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> isothionate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) or phycoerythrin (PE) and subsequently the cells stained with phycoerythrin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> (PE-Cy5)-conjugated APO2.7 mAb were assessed within the gating area of the leukemic clone for monitoring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the bone marrow mononuclear cells with 3-10 microM of VK2 (menaquinone-3, -4 and -5) in vitro potently induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the leukemic blast cells as compared with the untreated control cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 MDS patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was more prominent on blastic cells than that on mature myeloid cells such as CD34-/CD33+ gated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, VK2 performed much less effectively on CD3-positive lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to VK2, VK1 did not show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that VK2 may be used for treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in blastic transformation </plain></SENT>
