<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the function of cell cycle control genes including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors known as p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), as well as p14(ARF) which blocks MDM-2 (an inhibitor of p53), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (RB1) protein and the mismatch repair gene MGMT is critical for hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation, we performed methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in low-density, non-adherent bone marrow cells from 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of p15(INK4b) and RB1 was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From selected patients, we analyzed the methylation pattern of cell cycle control genes in CD34+ bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine of 49 cases (80%) had at least one of five genes methylated in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples by analysing low-density non-adherent bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p15(INK4b) methylation was 34 of 49 samples (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of methylation of both p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) was four of 49 (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RB1 gene was methylated in seven samples (14%) and each patient had RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, none of these genes were methylated in the purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients had a methylated p15(INK4b) promoter correlating with non-detectable expression of this gene in bone marrow cells from those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that hypermethylation of cell cycle control genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may occur late during the differentiation of myelodysplastic stem cells </plain></SENT>
