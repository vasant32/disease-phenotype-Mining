<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied four patients with inv(11)(p15q22) associated with malignant myeloid diseases by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with phage and cosmid probes mapped and ordered on 11q22-24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the four patients had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> as the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and had received cytotoxic chemotherapy, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other two had de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11q breakpoints were located centromeric to the MLL gene and between cosmids CN2900 and CN1323 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone that spanned the inv(11) breakpoints on 11q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From this YAC, we identified a P1 clone, which included the breakpoints in at least three of the four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is highly likely that the same gene on the P1 clone is rearranged in leukemic cells of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This gene may be one of the targets for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
