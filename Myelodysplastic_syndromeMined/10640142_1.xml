<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a 73-year-old man diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 and with a t(11;11;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first case with both abnormalities present in the same cells and with the t(11;11;22) involving a chromosome 11 already duplicated at 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This band contains the MLL gene that undergoes partial tandem duplication in patients with +11, which is "promiscuous," being translocated with a large number of genetic partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient had a complex karyotype that was completely defined by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique demonstrated that the t(11;11;22) derivative with a duplication of band 11q23 carried from three to four copies of MLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two copies of the gene were close to each other and centromeric to the break-point region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene might have happened before the occurrence of t(11;11;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering the associated chromosome defects, the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for the long arm of chromosome 7, due to an unbalanced translocation t(7;17), further underlines the possibility that a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene might have taken place </plain></SENT>
