<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> is mediated by DNA methyltransferases, including DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNMT3A mutations have recently been reported in patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), providing a rationale for examining the status of DNMT3A in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the frequency of DNMT3A mutations in patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sequenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding exons of DNMT3A using DNA from bone marrow and paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells from 150 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and identified 13 heterozygous mutations with predicted translational consequences in 12/150 patients (8.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amino acid R882, located in the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3A, was the most common mutation site, accounting for 4/13 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNMT3A mutations were expressed in the majority of cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested mutant samples regardless of myeloblast counts, suggesting that DNMT3A mutations occur early in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with DNMT3A mutations had worse overall survival compared with patients without DNMT3A mutations (P=0.005) and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P=0.007), suggesting that DNMT3A mutation status may have prognostic value in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
