<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three months later the treatment was discontinued on 22 patients that showed ineffective and 2 more patients withdrew from the treatment due to exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 36 patients were treated according to the original protocol, and the doses of these 2 drugs were reduced by half until the condition was exacerbated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was conducted for 47 (34-78) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, complete remission (CR) was seen in 1 patient, partial remission (PR) in 6 patients, and hematologic Improvement (HI) in 19 of the 60 patients evaluated with a response rate of 43.3% (26/60) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 50% (24/48) in RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> group, and 16.7% (2/12) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were not significant differences in cellularity, dysplastic hematopoiesis, and myeloblast before and after treatment among the RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of treatment, CR was seen in 1 patient, PR in 7, and HI in 9, with a response rate of 28.3% (17/60) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 35.4% (17/48) in the RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> group, and 0% (0/12) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects were mild and did not require discontinuance of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival time of the 19 patients in the RA group that responded well to treatment was 54 months (41, 66), significantly longer than that of the 20 patients without good outcomes [23 months (13,32), chi2=4.72, P=0.025] </plain></SENT>
