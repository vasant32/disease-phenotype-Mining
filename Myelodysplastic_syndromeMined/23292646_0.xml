<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old female patient presented with late relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She received a single cycle of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> before refusing further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Around 6 weeks after this single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> cycle, complete remission-according to international working group criteria-was observed with continuous improvement in peripheral blood counts to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, transfusion-independence, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast count (&lt; 5 %) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and flow cytometry, as well as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow karyotype and no dysplastic stigmata suggestive of a coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient also showed a pronounced improvement in performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven months later a second relapse occurred, followed by one additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> cycle that showed only a transient and a minor increase in thrombocytes and granulocytes, corresponding to an international working group nonresponse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> treatment was interrupted after a single cycle, this case gives insight into the kinetics of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after the second relapse suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> administration should be maintained after response </plain></SENT>
