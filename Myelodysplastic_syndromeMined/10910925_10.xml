<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A previous study reported that a nondifferentiating myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line produced differentiation-inhibiting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the factors was purified as a homologue of the nm23 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nm23 genes were overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cells, and a higher level of nm23 gene expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study determined the plasma levels of nm23-H1 protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and assessed the association between this level and the clinical outcome in 102 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of nm23-H1 was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma nm23-H1 levels were correlated with the product of the intracellular nm23 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) level and the white blood cell count, but not with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, nm23-H1 plasma levels probably depend on the total mass of leukemic cells overexpressing the nm23-H1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was lower in patients with higher plasma nm23-H1 levels than in those with lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed that elevated plasma nm23-H1 levels significantly contributed to the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the plasma nm23-H1 levels were investigated in 70 patients with other hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma nm23-H1 levels were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma levels of nm23-H1 may have prognostic value in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
