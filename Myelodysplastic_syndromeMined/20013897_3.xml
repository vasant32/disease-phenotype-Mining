<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CDKN2A gene is suggested to play a key role in these aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study overviewing 9p losses in hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, we introduce the term focal 9p instability to indicate multiple areas of copy number loss or homozygous loss within a larger heterozygous one in 9p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization to study patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, n = 140), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 20), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that 9p instability is restricted to ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 58/140 (41%) patients with ALL had a loss in 9p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 9p instability was detected in 19% of the patients with ALL and always included homozygous loss of CDKN2A along with loss of CDKN2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other possibly important genes included MTAP, IFN, MLLT3, JAK2, PTPLAD2, and PAX5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13/27 (48%) patients with the instability had the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene or other oncogene-activating translocation or structural aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had homozygous loss of hsa-mir -31, a microRNA known to regulate IKZF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IKZF1 deletion at 7p12.1 was seen in 10 (37%) patients with the 9p instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in ALL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, loss of CDKN2A and other target genes in the instability region is frequently associated with BCR/ABL1 and IKZF1 dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The multiple mechanisms leading to 9p instability including physical or epigenetic loss of the target genes, loss of the microRNA cluster, and the role of FRA9G fragile site are discussed </plain></SENT>
