<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> with transient occipital lobe abnormalities on imaging studies is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition has been called reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation usually includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss a two-year-old male with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> who presented 2 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0010553'>oculogyric crisis</z:hpo>, without other complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and was receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography scan of the head revealed marked bilateral lucencies mainly involving the white matter of the occipital lobes, with a few foci of punctate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The condition improved when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was discontinued, but an area of leukomalacia was identified on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010553'>oculogyric crisis</z:hpo> as a presentation of reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> has not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognizing this association is important, because patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> are often receiving other medications that can potentially cause dystonic eye movements, possibly leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment, which can result in an irreversible neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
