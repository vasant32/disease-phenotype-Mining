<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 is an inducer of nonlymphoid leukemic cell differentiation to monocyte-macrophage-like in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of oral administration of 4.5-15 micrograms/d 1 alpha (OH)D3, which is converted to 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 in vivo by liver cells, on leukemic cells were studied in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these three cases, 1 alpha (OH)D3 reduced the number of leukemic cells in the bone marrow and aggregated the dispersed chromatin of leukemic cells as heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this drug induced atypical lymphocyte-like cells, which were considered to be differentiated from leukemic cells in case 1, and improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in case 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> developed during 1 alpha (OH)D3 therapy in case 1, it disappeared within three days after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied the in vitro effects of 1 alpha, 25 (OH)2D3 on leukemic cells freshly isolated from the bone marrow in these three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After incubation with 10(-8) M 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 at 37 degrees C for 72 h, the number of adherent cells on the bottom of Petri dishes had increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells were quite similar to monocyte-macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These leukemic cells, after differentiation induced by 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3, reacted strongly with monoclonal antibodies My-4 and My-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both 100 microM D-cis and L-cis diltiazem (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>) enhanced the differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells induced by 1 alpha, 25 (OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between D-cis and L-cis diltiazem with regard to this enhancing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells induced by 1 alpha, 25(OH)2 D3 and/or diltiazem, was increased significantly as compared with that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells incubated without inducers </plain></SENT>
