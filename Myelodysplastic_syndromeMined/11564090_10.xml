<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO)-based intravenous formulation of busulphan in the conditioning of 45 patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Busulphan was given as a single daily dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients a single dose of intravenous busulphan, given over 3 h in 1 d, was combined with additional oral (single daily) doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four daily doses intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Busulphan plasma levels were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity with daily intravenous doses of 2.8-3.1 mg/kg infused over 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>) was seen in 30 patients receiving busulphan as an intravenous formulation over 4 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of 15 patients receiving three oral doses and one intravenous single daily dose, one patient experienced mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken over at least 2 d of treatment in 44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) values normalized for a dose of 1 mg/kg were 7000 ng/ml x h on d 1 and 5890 ng/ml x h on d 4, thus showing a moderate decrease over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a moderate increase of the clearance from 2.6 to 3.0 ml/min/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Administration of busulphan as a DMSO-based intravenous formulation was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total dose of busulphan can be given in four (rather than the typical 16) doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With such a regimen, the intravenous administration becomes feasible on an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
