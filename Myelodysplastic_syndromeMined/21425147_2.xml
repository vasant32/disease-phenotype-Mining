<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated predictive factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective review of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> patients treated with induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, International Prognostic Scoring System, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status, cytogenetics, duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> treatment were evaluated for their impact on complete response (CR), CR with low platelets, and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors evaluated 61 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients who received induction chemotherapy; 59% (36 patients) achieved CR/CR with low platelets (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%-71%), and median OS was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.9-8.1) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three factors were associated with lower CR/CR with low platelets and OS: poor risk cytogenetics, prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, and longer time to transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those treated with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, 32% achieved CR/CR with low platelets versus 78% in the group not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (odds ratio [OR], 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median OS for those treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide was 3.7 versus 10.5 months for those not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CR/CR with low platelets rate for those with intermediate risk cytogenetics was 70% versus 35% for those with poor risk (OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.38-13.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those with poor risk cytogenetics had a median OS of 2.8 versus 7.5 months for those with intermediate risk (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, poor risk cytogenetics, and longer time to transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are independent negative predictive factors for response and OS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> after induction therapy </plain></SENT>
