<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A portion of his marrow remained chronically involved with HCL, but the remainder evolved from being morphologically and karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to involvement with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi>, with cells having a bizarre karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of four metaphase cells had consistent abnormalities, with a missing chromosome No. 5, structural rearrangements resulting in deletion of part of the long arm of chromosome No. 7, deletion of 2q, and a small ring chromosome; upon further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, a translocation between chromosomes No. 12 and 15 and deletion of the long arm of chromosome No. 19 were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore add HCL patients to the growing list of those at risk of developing a secondary hematologic malignant disease possibly due to cytotoxic therapy for their primary disorder </plain></SENT>
