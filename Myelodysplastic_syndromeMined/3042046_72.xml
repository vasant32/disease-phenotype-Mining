<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a phase I/II study of the administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses ranging from 15 to 480 micrograms/m2 were administered as a one-hour or four-hour intravenous infusion daily for 7 days or as a 12-hour infusion for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temporary improvements were seen in granulocyte counts, monocyte counts, and reticulocyte counts in six of eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and five of seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> had larger increases in granulocyte, monocyte, and reticulocyte counts than did those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and they also had increases in the numbers of eosinophils (two of seven), immature myeloid cells (two of seven), and myeloblasts (two of seven) that were not observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction in erythrocyte transfusion requirements, and no effect was observed on platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was only minimal toxicity consisting of transient low-back discomfort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low-grade fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that GM-CSF is well tolerated and is more likely to result in elevations of blood counts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but the role of GM-CSF therapy in these disorders remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
