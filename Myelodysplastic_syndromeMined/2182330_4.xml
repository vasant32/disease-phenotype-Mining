<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An increasing amount of data provides strong evidence for the complex multifactorial control of primary hemopoietic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present a new multicellular functional unit, the Hematon, isolated from the light-density floating fraction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow (BM) aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Hematon is organized in a compact, three-dimensional spheroid complex from central adipocytes, fibroblastoid cells, and resident macrophages that compartmentalize myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and their progenies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hematon fraction is more than twofold more abundant in progenitor cells when compared to the mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction as gauged by cytological techniques and by analysis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual Hematons may produce, within 2-3 weeks, up to 50,000 hemopoietic cells of different cell lineages in organotypic microcultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) significantly stimulated the endogenous cell production of some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the individually treated Hematons, indicating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of factor-responsive cells within the Hematon population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative observations of 184 BM aspirates support the hypothesis that the presence of Hematons in a BM aspirate correlates positively with homeostatic blood cell production, because the Hematon was present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM (31/40) and it was rare among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (15/53), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (7/39), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (5/52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the Hematon represents a unifying model around which the variability of fundamental BM functions and dysfunctions can be explored </plain></SENT>
