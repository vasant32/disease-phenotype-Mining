<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic implication of RUNX1 mutations in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stage of the disease at which the mutations are acquired and whether they persist during the disease course also remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed mutations of RUNX1 exons 3-8 in 132 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and correlated the results with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial studies were performed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (12%) had RUNX1 mutations at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> RUNX1 mutations that were detected at diagnosis remained unchanged during the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two other patients acquired RUNX1 mutations at leukaemic transformation 34 months and 35 months after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with RUNX1 mutations at diagnosis had higher neutrophil counts and higher frequency of -7/7q deletion than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RUNX1 mutation was closely associated with a short overall survival (P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to demonstrate that RUNX1 mutation can not only be detected early at diagnosis but also acquired during disease progression and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may play a role in the development and progression of a subset of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
