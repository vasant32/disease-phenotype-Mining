<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report an extremely rare case of pseudo-Gaucher cell proliferation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 77-year old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and subsequent bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> revealed infiltrates of foamy vacuolated macrophages without any evidence of other morphologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A karyotype analysis showed the presence of 46,XY,del(20)(q11) in 20 of 20 examined bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a splenectomy, and the resulting pathologic findings revealed massive infiltration of foamy vacuolated macrophages, which were morphologically compatible with Gaucher cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activities of beta-glucosidase and acid sphingomyelinase were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges; therefore, the foamy vacuolated macrophages were considered pseudo-Gaucher cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, subclassified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, was then made according to World Health Organization classification guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pseudo-Gaucher cell proliferation and infiltration might therefore be observed in other patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
