<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large-scale profiling of gene expression by DNA microarray analysis is a promising approach with which to identify molecular markers specific to de novo or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach has now been adopted with AC133-positive hematopoietic stem cell-like fractions purified from 10 individuals, each with either de novo or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> of the M2 subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sets of genes whose activity was associated with either disease course were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, on the basis of the expression profiles of these genes, it was possible to predict correctly the clinical diagnosis for 17 (85%) of the 20 cases in a cross-validation trial </plain></SENT>
