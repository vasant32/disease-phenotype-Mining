<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The colony-to-cluster ratio of CFU-GM and the dose-response curves of CFU-GM to stimulation by rhGM-CSF in vitro did not change during the clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage of CFU-GM in DNA synthesis, which is a measure of the proliferative rates of these cells, determined by the high specific activity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> kill technique in vitro, was markedly enhanced in a reversible fashion after administration in vivo of rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased cycling rates of CFU-GM were consistent with the induced increase in neutrophil counts in these patients that has been reported elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, marrow CFU-GM from patients given rhGM-CSF in vivo were increased in sensitivity to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human H-subunit (acidic) ferritin in two of eight cases, and were increased in sensitivity to inhibition by lower dosages of recombinant human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of CFU-GM to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human interferon gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi> did not change during the clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that the rhGM-CSF is having an effect on CFU-GM in the patients on the phase I clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This information may be of significance in planning future clinical studies combining rhGM-CSF with chemotherapy and/or other biotherapy </plain></SENT>
