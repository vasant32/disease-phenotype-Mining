<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study compared genetic aberrations in hematopoietic cells (HCs) and mesenchymal stem cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSCs) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained chromosomes with aberrations from 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and chromosomes from 7 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations in both HCs and MSCs were identified using G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then performed DNA content analysis of the HCs and MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 13 of the 22 MDS patients (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations in MSCs were detected in 15 of the 22 MDS patients (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No chromosomal abnormalities were identified in MSCs of the 7 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate herein that MSCs have distinct genetic abnormalities compared to HCs from the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed a random loss of chromosomal material in significant proportions of MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of random loss may be a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, two case results showed that HCs and MSCs have different altered structural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicates that the genetic alterations in MSCs may constitute a particular biological mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
