<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that (1) 14 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (46.67 %) and 7 patients achieved partial remission (PR) (23.33 %) with one course of CHG regimen, total effective rate was 70%; 14 patient achieved CR (42.4%) and 9 patients achieved PR (27.3%) with one course of CAG regimen, total effective rate was 69.7%; 7 patient achieved CR (33.3%) and 3 patients achieved PR (9.1%) with one course of HA regimen, total effective rate was 42.4% </plain></SENT>
