<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cytogenetic and clinical characteristics of inv(3q) (q21q26) and t(3;3) (q21; q26) aberrations as well as prognosis, cases were collected and chromosome specimens of bone marrow cells were prepared by 24-hour culture, while G-banding technique was used to perform karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the simple inv(3q) and t(3; 3) aberrations were rare, they commonly combined with other chromosome aberrations such as -7/7q- and t (9; 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involved diseases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 24 patients, 2 patients diagnosed with M(5) subtype did not achieve complete remission after multiple chemotherapy; 2 patients received allogenic stem cell transplantation relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that 3q21q26 aberration commonly combined with chromosome aberration 7/7q-, for these patients the efficacy of chemical therapy is poor, the efficacy of bone marrow transplant is too poor, these patients with inv(3q) and t(3; 3) aberrations have poor prognosis and short overall survival </plain></SENT>
