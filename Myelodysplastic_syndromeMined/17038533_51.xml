<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To prospectively assess the applicability of reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIC-HSCT), we wrote a protocol in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated patients 50 years or older with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and unfavorable cytogenetics would be evaluated during induction for a possible RIC-HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine of 259 patients entered CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three of the 99 were seen by the Transplant Service with the remainder not seen because of illness, lack/unavailability of siblings, refusal, or, primarily, unclear reasons (21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A donor was identified for 26 patients (21 sibling, 5 unrelated) with RIC-HSCT performed in 14 (13 sibling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results in consulted patients suggested that 50% or fewer of the 85 patients who did not undergo transplantation were potential transplant candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attempted to find one or more chemotherapy pair-mates for each patient who underwent transplantation based on cytogenetics, age, and a relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) time that was more than or equal to the time from CR1 to RIC-HSCT in the patient who underwent transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the 39 matches favored (longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) RIC-HSCT and 7, chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability that the corresponding beta distribution was different than expected (ie, that RIC-HSCT was superior) was 0.99 (P=.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were similar with respect to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While RIC-HSCT thus seems of interest, methods are needed to extend its applicability </plain></SENT>
