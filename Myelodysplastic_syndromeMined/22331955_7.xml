<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the implementation of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in 1997, knowledge concerning the prognostic impact of abnormalities has increased substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study proposes a new and comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system based on an international data collection of 2,902 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included from the German-Austrian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Study Group (n = 1,193), the International <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Risk Analysis Workshop (n = 816), the Spanish Hematological Cytogenetics Working Group (n = 849), and the International Working Group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Cytogenetics (n = 44) databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and oligoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with supportive care only were evaluated for overall survival (OS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Internal validation by bootstrap analysis and external validation in an independent patient cohort were performed to confirm the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 19 cytogenetic categories were defined, providing clear prognostic classification in 91% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were classified into five prognostic subgroups (P &lt; .001): very good (median OS, 61 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; n = 81); good (49 months; HR, 1.0 [reference category]; n = 1,809); intermediate (26 months; HR, 1.6; n = 529); poor (16 months; HR, 2.6; n = 148); and very poor (6 months; HR, 4.2; n = 187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The internal and external validations confirmed the results of the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data should contribute to the ongoing efforts to update the IPSS by refining the cytogenetic risk categories </plain></SENT>
