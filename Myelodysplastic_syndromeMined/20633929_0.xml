<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to improve the predictive power of the WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) by including age in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 136 Korean patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> between 1995 and 2008 were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>114 patients were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An individualized age-adapted scoring system was developed to improve the accuracy of prognosis of the WPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The WPSS was significantly associated with the prediction of survival and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the risk of a patient with the WPSS was best represented by the values 0 (very low), +1 (low), +2 (intermediate), +3 (high), and +4 (very high), these values were found to vary between -1.0 and 4.2 in the same patients when age was included as a factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The WPSS may vary according to age, &lt;55 or â‰¥55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated difference in median survival was more prominent in the lower risk groups of the WPSS than in the higher-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to the WPSS, age was found to significantly influence the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and provided a more individualized prognosis for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
