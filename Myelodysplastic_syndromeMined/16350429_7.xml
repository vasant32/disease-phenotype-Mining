<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We implemented guidelines to switch anemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from epoetin alfa 40,000 U weekly to darbepoetin alfa 200 microg every 2 weeks and then conducted a retrospective cohort study of the initial 263 treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (&gt; or = 18 years old, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis) were either previously treated with epoetin alfa (received 16 weeks of prior epoetin alfa and either switched to darbepoetin alfa or remained on epoetin alfa) or treatment-naive (no previous erythropoietin therapy and received only 1 agent for 16 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both major response and minor response based on the International Working Group criteria were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was not powered to statistically compare treatment groups; values presented are for descriptive purposes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from 244 patient records were included: 142 previous epoetin alfa patients (80 switched to darbepoetin alfa, 62 remained on epoetin alfa) and 102 naive patients (56 darbepoetin alfa, 46 epoetin alfa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major response rates were similar between treatment groups in both the naive (46% for darbepoetin alfa, 35% for epoetin alfa) and previous epoetin alfa groups (26% for darbepoetin alfa, 17% for epoetin alfa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall response rates were 42%-76% across treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in transfusions across groups were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of anemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with either darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa appeared to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas epoetin alfa was most frequently administered on a weekly basis, darbepoetin alfa was most frequently administered every 2 weeks, which may offer the benefit of convenience with its less frequent dosing </plain></SENT>
