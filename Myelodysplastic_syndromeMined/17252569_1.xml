<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course and outcome of children with treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (tAML) and compare them to children with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (pAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed the demographic, treatment, toxicity, and outcome data of children with tAML and treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (tMDS), treated at our institution between 1975 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared these parameters with matched controlled children with pAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally we compared overall survival (OS) for tAML with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pAML children treated at the study era in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with tAML (n = 19) and tMDS (n = 2) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three years event-free survival (EFS) and OS were both 14 +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to pAML patients, tAML had a higher rate of adverse cytogenetics (P &lt; 0.008) and inferior OS (P = 0.027) but no significant difference in treatment toxicity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors were treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population based report of pediatric tAML, outcome was poor and was related to a higher probability of poor cytogenetic features rather than excessive toxicities or inability to deliver therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HSCT should be considered for patients with tAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings should set the stage for prospective cooperative studies </plain></SENT>
