<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a panel of 29 selected markers was evaluated in 317 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 5415 posttransplantation samples were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recipient genotype discrimination was possible in 96% with a mean number of 2.5 (1-7) informative markers per recipient/donor pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marker specific standard dilution series from volunteers' DNA served as standard for quantification of chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of the method was &lt; or =1 x 10-3 (0.1% of recipient cells) in 83.3% of the assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By this method, it was possible to very accurately detect autologous signals in the range from 0% to 0.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] +/-0.2), from 0.5% to 1% (95% CI +/-0.4), from 1% to 2% (95% CI +/-0.6) and from 2% to 5% (95% CI +/-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of the quantified autologous signals was independent from the amount of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on a SP-based chimerism system allowing for the performance of chimerism analyses for virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with high sensitivity, excellent reproducibility, and precision of measurement </plain></SENT>
