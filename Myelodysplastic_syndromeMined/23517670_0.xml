<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously defined the most frequent region of copy number increase at 3q26.2 to EVI1 (ecotropic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration site-1) and MDS1 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 1) (aka MECOM), an observation recently confirmed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genome atlas (TCGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MECOM is increased at the DNA, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and protein level and likely contributes to patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report that EVI1 is aberrantly spliced, generating multiple variants including a Del(190-515) variant (equivalent to previously reported) expressed in &gt;90% of advanced stage serous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although EVI1(Del190-515) lacks ∼70% of exon 7, it binds CtBP1 as well as SMAD3, important mediators of TGFβ signaling, similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with EVI1 1-268 which failed to interact with CtBP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the EVI1(Del190-515) splice variant preferentially localizes to PML nuclear bodies compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and EVI1(Del427-515) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> EVI1 efficiently repressed TGFβ-mediated AP-1 (activator protein-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoters, EVI1(Del190-515) elicited a slight increase in both promoter activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of EVI1 and EVI1(Del427-515) (but not EVI1(Del190-515)) in OVCAR8 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> cells increased cyclin E1 LMW expression and cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, knockdown of specific EVI1 splice variants (both MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1(Del190-515)) markedly increased claudin-1 mRNA and protein expression in HEY ovarian and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in claudin-1 were associated with alterations in specific epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers concurrent with reduced migratory potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, EVI1 is frequently aberrantly spliced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> with specific forms eliciting altered functions which could potentially contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
