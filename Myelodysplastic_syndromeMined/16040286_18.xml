<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphologic features of bone marrow aspirate smears were correlated with FC and cytogenetic findings blindly, and patterns of antigen expression were compared with patterns seen in nonneoplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 124 cases, 58 (46.7%) had definitive FC abnormalities ("flow-abnormal"), 19 cases (15.3%) had mild FC abnormalities of indeterminate significance, and 47 cases (37.9%) had essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly significant differences were identified between the flow-abnormal group and other groups in mean myeloid blast percentages and numbers of abnormal antigens expressed, even when the analysis was limited to cases with fewer than 5% myeloid blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, flow-abnormal cases constituted 50 (89%) of the 56 morphologically abnormal cases and 31 (94%) of the 33 cytogenetically abnormal cases, demonstrating the strong concordance of FC-identified antigenic abnormalities with morphologic features and cytogenetics in the evaluation of patients with unexplained cytopenias </plain></SENT>
