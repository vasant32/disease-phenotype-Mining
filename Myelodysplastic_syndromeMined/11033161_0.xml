<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On June 22, 1996, we found a disc-sized choroidal lesion with milky appearance on the paramacular in his right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 1 month, a similar choroidal lesion was found near the disc in the same eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and antituberculosis medications, those choroidal lesions gradually enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In November, satellite lesions were found around them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001147'>retinal exudates</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were also detected in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He died on April 6, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found Langhan's giant cells in the choroid on the specimen of his eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So we judged the choroidal lesions to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>.Conclusion: This case showed choroidal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> and choroidal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041321" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miliary tuberculosis</z:e> in the same eye that were resistant to medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We thought resistance to medication was due to destruction of the immune system by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
