<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analysed by immunocytochemistry the expression of p53, bcl-2 and ras proteins in bone marrow blasts from 59 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (AL), 36 myeloid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 23 lymphoid (ALL), and from 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); our aim was to examine if abnormalities in their expression were associated with peculiar biological and clinical findings, or with an altered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate, as measured by TUNEL technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oncoproteins were expressed with extreme variability, without significant differences among the various morphological or immunological AL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean percentages of bcl-2+ blasts were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p = 0.01), and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with bone marrow blastosis than in the forms without excess of blasts (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lowest percentages of apoptotic cells were observed in ALL (mean 1%, p = 0.006), whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the apoptotic index was higher (16.7%) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (8.6%) and than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (10.8%). but the difference tended to be statistically significant only for cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the apoptotic rate was independent of the oncoprotein expression, in ALL there was a significant linear relationship between TUNEL and ras positivity (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients treated with intensive polychemotherapy, no differences were observed in oncoprotein expression and apoptotic rate between responders and resistant cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> and enhanced cell survival are associated with AL, whereas a high level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be responsible for the ineffective hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; abnormal expression of oncoproteins, even if not strictly related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> level, may influence disease behaviour </plain></SENT>
