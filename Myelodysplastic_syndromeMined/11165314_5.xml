<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The information obtained by conventional cytogenetics (CC) in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> is sometimes limited, in particular by complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While CC is restricted to metaphases with a good quality, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) is also capable of analyzing specific anomalies in the interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) gives additional information about the imbalanced karyotype changes in the whole genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of CGH to the unraveling of complex GTG karyotypes, which are difficult to evaluate by banding analysis, and to compare these results with those by CC and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen bone marrow samples and one sample obtained from peripheral blood of 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients were examined by CC, FISH and CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GTG banding analysis showed complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities were numerical and structural aberrations on chromosomes 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 of the 14 samples, the CGH analysis was able to detect chromosomal imbalances with losses of material on chromosome 5 and 7 as the most frequent aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 samples, additional FISH analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For most of the studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, a close correlation between CC, FISH and CGH data was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CGH was considerably helpful in adding additional information to classical karyotyping, if the low quality or number of metaphases was insufficient for a reliable CC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even in cases where whole chromosome painting could be applied, it added information on the breakpoints of the observed rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In only 2 of the studied 14 samples, neither CGH nor I-FISH could improve the result of karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CGH, nevertheless, can be regarded as a powerful additional technique in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with unsuccessful CC, incomplete, or complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A systematic analysis by three techniques such as CC, FISH and CGH guarantees an optimal genetic characterization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
