<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 13 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic since 1979 with inversions of chromosome 3 or related abnormalities; 12 acquired and one constitutional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient with the constitutional abnormality had an inv(3)(p21q29) and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 patients with acquired abnormalities, five had inv(3) (q21q26.2), three had t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), one had del(3)(q12q21), one had ins(6;3) (p21;q21q26.2), one had inv(3)(p21q12), and one had r(3)(p?21q?21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of these patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; eight had antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, eight presented with platelet counts greater than 100 x 10(3)/microliters, and six had atypical megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had ringed sideroblasts in their marrow, an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received chemotherapy but showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the time of chromosome study, the median duration of survival was 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that 1) although abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis is observed in patients with inv(3)(q21q26.2), multiple hematopoietic lineages are also involved in the neoplastic process; 2) an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> with inv(3) or related abnormalities; 3) affected patients have a poor survival and are resistant to conventional chemotherapy; and 4) abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> may also be associated with pericentric inversions of chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
