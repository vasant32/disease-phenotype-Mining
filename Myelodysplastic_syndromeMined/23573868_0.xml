<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lentivirus FTMT-transduced CD34(+) bone marrow cells from seven healthy donors and CD34(+) cells from 24 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RS were cultured according to a procedure that allowed the expansion of high numbers of erythroid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells were used to investigate the possible influence of experimentally-induced FTMT overexpression on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythropoiesis and the functional effects of FTMT in sideroblastic erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RS progenitors, FTMT overexpression was associated with reduced cytosolic ferritin levels, increased surface transferrin receptor expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>reduced cell proliferation</z:mp>; FTMT effects were independent of SF3B1 mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, FTMT overexpressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid progenitors were characterized by reduced cytosolic ferritin content and increased CD71 expression, and also by higher apoptotic rate in comparison with the FTMT- controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower levels of STAT5 phosphorylation following erythropoietin stimulation were found in both sideroblastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FTMT(+) erythroid cells compared to the FTMT- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, experimental overexpression of FTMT may modify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron availability and lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
