<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) rearrangements have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> (MMM) and also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group A proteins are nonhistone nuclear proteins that bind DNA and regulate the transcriptional activity of many genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used FISH, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome RP11-513I15 probe, to study 16 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> with chromosome 6 short arm rearrangements, most of them following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these we found two 6p21.3 duplications and one 6p21.3 triplication involving HMGA1 in four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these four cases, duplications and triplication were partially masked at the cytogenetic level by a derivative chromosome 6 resulting from translocation with another chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMGA1 proteins have been recently found overexpressed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, but to our knowledge this is the first reported duplication of HMGA1 </plain></SENT>
