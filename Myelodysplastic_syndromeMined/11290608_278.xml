<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is found in 20% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, mutations of the c-KIT gene, which have been found in mast cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, are clustered in 2 distinct regions, the JM domain and D816 within the activation loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to analyze the mutation of D835 of FLT3, which corresponds to D816 of c-KIT, in a large series of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several kinds of missense mutations were found in 30 of the 429 (7.0%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases, 1 of the 29 (3.4%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases, and 1 of the 36 (2.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The D835Y mutation was most frequently found (22 of the 32 D835 mutations), followed by the D835V (5), and D835H (1), D835E (1), and D835N (1) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note is that D835 mutations occurred independently of FLT3/ITD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An analysis in the 201 patients newly diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (excluding M3) revealed that, in contrast to the FLT3/ITD mutation (n = 46), D835 mutations (n = 8) were not significantly related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, but tended to worsen disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> D835-mutant FLT3 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and transformed 32D cells, suggesting these mutations were constitutively active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the FLT3 gene is the target most frequently mutated to become constitutively active in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
