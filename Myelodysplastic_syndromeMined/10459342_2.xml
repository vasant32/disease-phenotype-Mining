<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at diagnosis; at 15 months, hematological evidence of transformation was present, and repeat cytogenetics showed a novel rearrangement of one chromosome 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two breaks had occurred; one in the short arm at 16p11, with translocation of the segment distal to this onto chromosome 21q, and the other in the long arm at 16q22 with subsequent deletion of the segment from 16q22--&gt;qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the abnormalities detected by cytogenetics and excluded involvement of the AML1 gene on 21q22 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient is more characteristic of t(16;21) than inv(16), and adds to the spectrum of chromosome 16 abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
