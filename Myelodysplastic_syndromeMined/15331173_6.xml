<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The modulation of signals by TNF-alpha receptor super-family is involved in the regulation of cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and control of the cell survival including cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have monitored the kinetics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> on PC cells, after TNF-alpha exposure of pre-treated cells to anti-CD95 and anti-CD45 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that in comparison with untreated cells, TNF-alpha, after 6-24 h of incubation significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in PC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were significantly different in comparison to both untreated cells and cells pre-treated with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, TNF-alpha on PC cells pre-treated with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody significantly decreased apoptotic and necrotic form of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that anti-CD45 and CD95 monoclonal antibodies modulates the effect of TNF-alpha on this cell line in vitro, and that these molecules participate in TNF-alpha cytotoxic response </plain></SENT>
