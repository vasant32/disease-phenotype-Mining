<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is one of the worst prognostic indicators in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, associated with chemotherapy resistance and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These deletions center at band 5q31, which has thus been proposed as the location of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene; this site is to be distinguished from that observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, centering at 5q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define the molecular extent and the clinical prevalence of 5q31 deletions, we collected a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases of mixed karyotype, taking care to exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using a panel polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite markers from 5q, comparing malignant cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines or buccal mucosa scrapings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Losses were detected in seven of 29 matched samples, including four of 17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and three of 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; six of these seven also had a cytogenetically-visible del(5q) or -5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The one case without a cytogenetic deletion showed molecular loss of three contiguous markers, with retention of flanking markers interleukin-9 (IL-9) and D5S414, and thus contained a small deletion that is below cytogenetic resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR failed to detect 5q loss in two cases with large cytogenetic deletions, but both had been treated and contained low percentages of malignant cells in the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study thus led to the identification of a case with a minimal deletion for the 5q31 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, specified by IL-9-D5S414, that is approximately 1 Mb (2 cM) in extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we demonstrate that PCR-based allelotyping is a reliable method for the detection of chromosomal deletion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e>, providing the specimens contain a high proportion of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies will help to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene at 5q31, and will help to develop molecular methods for diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders </plain></SENT>
