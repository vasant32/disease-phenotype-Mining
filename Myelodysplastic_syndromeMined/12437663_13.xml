<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natural-killer T (NKT) cells belong to a unique lymphocyte subset that expresses an invariant T-cell receptor (TCR), consisting of Valpha24JalphaQ, and common NK cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NKT cells have been hypothesized to play a role in immune regulation, and many human autoimmune conditions are associated with NKT cell deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the role of NKT cells in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry demonstrated that NKT cells, unlike other T-lymphocyte subpopulations, were disproportionally decreased in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we compared variability within the CDR3 region of Valpha24 in CD4-CD8- T cells derived from AA and healthy individuals, the CDR3 size of Valpha24 cells showed a polyclonal distribution in AA patients, while in control subjects a typical oligoclonal or monoclonal pattern was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern blot and sequence analysis of Valpha24 polymerase chain reaction products revealed that the NKT cell-specific JalphaQ region was predominant in control subjects, whereas it was not, or only very weakly, detected in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that NKT cells are profoundly decreased in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and their deficiency may, as in other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, play a role in the local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
