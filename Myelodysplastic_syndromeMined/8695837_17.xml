<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A phase III prospective randomized multicenter study was performed to determine whether <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> could improve the response rate of poor-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (ALs) to standard chemotherapy including a multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>)-related cytotoxic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rationale of the study was based on the negative prognostic value of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype in ALs and the ability of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> to reverse this phenotype both in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred fifteen patients (median age, 49 years; range, 16 to 65) with relapsed (n = 108) or refractory (n = 32) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), relapsed (n = 27) or refractory (n = 9) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), secondary AL (n = 22) or blastic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> ([<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>] n = 74) or myeloproliferative syndrome ([MPS] n = 43) were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> ([MXN] 12 mg/m2/d, days 2 to 5) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> ([Ara-C] 1 g/m2/12 h, days 1 to 5) alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg/d, days 1 to 5; continuous intravenous infusion beginning 24 hours before MXN infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> were observed in 56 of 161 quinine-treated patients and disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but four cases after one or two 20% dose decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera from <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi>-treated patients showed increased MXN uptake in an <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive cell line compared with matched sera obtained before <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">Quinine</z:chebi> induced a significant increase in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, mucositis, and cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) was observed in 85 of 161 patients (52.8%) from the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi>-treated group versus 70 of 154 patients (45.5%) in the control group (P = .19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important differences between <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> and control group CR rates were observed in patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> and blastic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was higher in P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-positive cases, although the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Failure of the regimen due to blastic persistence or blast number increase was higher in the control group (61 of 154 patients) than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52903">quinine group</z:chebi> (45 of 161, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in eight cases (four in each arm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in 27 cases (20 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52903">quinine group</z:chebi> v seven in control group, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significant increase of toxicity in the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> arm could have masked the clinical benefit of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> reversion in poor-risk ALs </plain></SENT>
