<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in donor cells after cord blood transplantation in a patient diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 3 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis performed in a cryopreserved aliquot of the cord blood showed 2.5% of nuclei with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cord blood donor was studied and he showed neither peripheral blood cytopenias nor cytological or cytogenetic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell blood counts (CBC) of the girl have improved over 2 yr while decreasing the percentage of monosomic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monosomic clone has finally disappeared and the CBC are finally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case of transient <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 started very early after engraftment emphasises the relevance of clonal instability of specific progenitor cells in the early engraftment, and host immune status, in cytogenetic abnormalities founded in donor cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the clinical follow-up of this patient, recommends a more conservative treatment for this clonal disease early developed after transplantation </plain></SENT>
