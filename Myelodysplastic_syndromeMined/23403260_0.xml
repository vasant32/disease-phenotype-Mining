<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it is a member of the INK4b family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, it was initially presumed that its loss in leukemic blasts caused a dysregulation of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, animal model experiments over the last several years have produced a very different picture of how p15Ink4b functions in hematopoietic cells and how its loss contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is clear now, that in early hematopoietic progenitors, p15Ink4b functions outside of its canonical role as a cell cycle inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its functions are involved in signal transduction and influence the development of erythroid, monocytic and dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
