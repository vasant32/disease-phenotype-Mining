<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For a better understanding of the karyotype evolution of different marrow cell populations in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 6 patients who eventually developed overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, belonging to a series of 46 MDS referred to our Institution, were studied ad diagnosis and at leukemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case the blast cells were separated from the maturing precursors of the erythroid and granulocytic lineage by centrifugation on a Percoll density gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parallel chromosome investigations were performed in each cell fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis performed at presentation did not reveal distinctive karyotype features in metaphases arising in the blast enriched cell fraction, as compared with those obtained from the fraction containing erythroblasts and promyelocytes--myelocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in the initial phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blast cells may lack distinctive cytogenetic features and may thus represent part of a clonal preleukemic proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, clonal aberrations [<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 and del(11)(q23)] showing a restricted pattern of distribution within the blast cell enriched fractions were detected in two patients, whereas one patient showed an increase in size of the abnormal clone carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, an aberration detected in metaphases obtained from both cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, some evolutive steps in the natural history of these disorders can be heralded by the acquisition of chromosome aberrations more readily detectable in blast enriched cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases, partial loss of differentiative capability by the abnormal clone may account for the detection, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, of chromosome aberrations involving both the blast cell fraction and the erythroblast-promyelocyte enriched cell fraction </plain></SENT>
