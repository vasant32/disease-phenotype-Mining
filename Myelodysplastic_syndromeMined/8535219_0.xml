<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversial therapeutic results have been obtained using growth factors or differentiating agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study we evaluated the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) in 10 MDS patients (5 male, 5 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the same dose of ATRA (45 mg/sqm/day) orally for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration &gt; 1g/dl was observed in 3/10 patients, while 5/10 patients showed an increase in granulocyte count &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l without concomitant increase in the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rise in the platelet count &gt; 50 x 10(9)/l was observed in 1/10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the effects were transient and maximal responses were obtained by the fourth week of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the peripheral blood counts started to drop again, reaching pre-therapy values by the end of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon could be attributed either to the exhaustion of an ATRA-responding cell pool, the development of cellular resistance to ATRA or to a reduction of plasma ATRA levels after prolonged treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to our results, it seems that ATRA might have therapeutic efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly if its effect could be improved by combinations with other differentiating agents or growth factors </plain></SENT>
