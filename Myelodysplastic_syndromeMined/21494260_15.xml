<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the TET2 gene in 86 MDS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with 20-30% blasts treated by AZA, that is disease categories wherein this drug is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (15%) carried TET2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with mutated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) TET2 had mostly comparable pretreatment characteristics, except for lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, better cytogenetic risk and longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration before AZA in TET2 mutated patients (P=0.03, P=0.047 and P=0.048, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate (including hematological improvement) was 82% in MUT versus 45% in WT patients (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutated TET2 (P=0.04) and favorable cytogenetic risk (intermediate risk: P=0.04, poor risk: P=0.048 compared with good risk) independently predicted a higher response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response duration and overall survival were, however, comparable in the MUT and WT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with low blast count, TET2 status may be a genetic predictor of response to AZA, independently of karyotype </plain></SENT>
