<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of Fas antigen and susceptibility to Fas-mediated suppression of donor-derived haematopoietic cells of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytofluorometric analysis revealed low expression of Fas on CD34+ bone marrow cells from marrow donors or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, significantly higher expression of Fas antigen was observed on CD34+ bone marrow cells of BMT recipients, in whom engraftment of donor bone marrow (BM) cells was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (Ab) (CH-11) to haematopoietic stem cell culture of BM cells more strongly suppressed colony formation from granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment by blocking anti-Fas Ab (ZB4) abrogated the Fas-mediated GM-CFU and BFU-E suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Purified marrow CD34+ cells from BMT recipients were also susceptible to the Fas-mediated colony suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, donor-derived CD34+ haematopoietic cells increased their expression of Fas antigen and were susceptible to Fas-mediated haematopoietic suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insight for understanding the haematological condition after BMT </plain></SENT>
