<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether apoptotic index, p53 and bcl-2 levels correlate with the clinical consequences of ineffective hematopoiesis; namely, the development of cytopenia and the shortened survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The apoptotic index, determined by TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling, as well as bcl-2 and p53 protein levels, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, were studied in bone marrow trephine biopsy archival samples from 25 healthy subjects aged over fifty (control group), 61 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 17 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> according to FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between relevant clinical parameters was analyzed with Spearman's correlation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing survival were studied by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The apoptotic index did not correlate with blood counts at diagnosis and had no prognostic influence on the overall survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p53 score correlated with both the leukocyte count (r=-0.274, p=0.034, Spearman's) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (r=-0.316; p=0.014) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients and showed an independent and significant prognostic influence on their overall survival (p=0.045, Cox's) while the bcl-2 score was not correlated with their blood counts or prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Apoptotic index and bcl-2 do not correlate with key clinical data in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, while p53 levels show a good correlation with these data and may be a useful parameter to add to current prognostic schemes in this entity </plain></SENT>
