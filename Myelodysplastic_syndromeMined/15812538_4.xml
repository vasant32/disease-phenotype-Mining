<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence at 15 years is 10-12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B-cell proliferative disorders (BCLP) are the most common MD in the first year after SCT; the incidence probability is 1% in allogeneic transplants but is much higher (until 14%) after HLA-identical, T-cell-depleted SCT in which Campath 1G or ATG are given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCLP develop because of reactivation of the EBV and a depressed cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prediction of risk of BCLP can be made by frequent monitoring of EBV load in patients with risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most effective therapies are the early administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro generated EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with very poor prognosis have been described in 4-18% of patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>, 12-24 months after autologous SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> increases over time and the cumulative incidence among children who underwent an SCT at less than 10 years of age is 6-11% at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are few studies evaluating quality of life (QOL) in children and adolescents who had received an SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: (a) The majority of long survivors enjoy good QOL and return successfully to school or work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(b) A minority (10-15%) complain of physical problems or present moderate cognitive or psychological dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(c) The importance of family, other social support and psychological adjustments is generally recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More extensive, longitudinal and comparative studies with other alternative therapies are required </plain></SENT>
