<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of symptomatic and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) spans several therapeutic goals and options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Key to the successful therapy of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> diseases is careful characterization and diagnosis, including clinical, cytogenetic, biological, and molecular evaluation of individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any novel management strategy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> must be based on accepted and validated prognostic scoring systems, such as the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), and should take into account predictive parameters of response to the available therapeutic agents and individual comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For IPSS lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, several first-line options are available, including erythropoietic stimulating agents, lenalidomide, and immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential therapy is advisable whenever response is lost, and the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in first- or second-line therapy is relevant, especially in patients with symptomatic cytopenias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylating agents have a central role in therapy of IPSS higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These agents include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, which allow treatment of very elderly and frail patients, resulting in hematological improvement and transfusion independency in roughly half, and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> a demonstrated significant prolongation of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because hypomethylating agents are not curative, they are not satisfactory for younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, for whom a transplantation strategy should be planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although hypomethylating agent therapy is used extensively, a growing number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients fail to respond or progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The future challenge is not only to find treatment regimens that target the dysplastic clone(s) so that durable remissions are achieved (particularly in high-risk patients with short survival and/or increased leukemic transformation rates), but also to also identify active salvage regimens </plain></SENT>
