<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the influence of baseline patient and transplant characteristics on hematopoietic recovery was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>/short course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and in four patients additional ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 microg/kg/day) (n = 22) or no rhG-CSF (n = 25) in a non-randomized manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient groups with and without rhG-CSF were rather comparable with respect to baseline patient and transplant characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to neutrophil counts (ANC) &gt;500/microl was 14 days with rhG-CSF vs 16 days without rhG-CSF (P = 0.048), to ANC &gt;1000/microl was 15 vs 18 days (P = 0.084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery was accelerated in patients receiving more than the median MNC dose of 2.54 x 10(8)/kg with a median time to ANC &gt;1000/microl of 13 days vs 19 days (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RhG-CSF did not influence platelet recovery and incidence of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD II-IV was 50% with rhG-CSF and 28% without rhG-CSF (P = 0.144), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD II-IV occurred in 9% of patients with and 20% of patients without rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 38 and 36 months in patients with and without rhG-CSF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival at 2 years post-transplant was 39% (95% confidence interval (18%, 60%)) in patients with rhG-CSF and 24% (95% confidence interval (7%, 41%)) in patients without rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Administration of rhG-CSF after VUD-BMT may lead to more rapid neutrophil recovery, but did not influence the incidence of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving rhG-CSF showed a slightly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD II-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Higher numbers of MNC in the marrow graft accelerated hematopoietic engraftment </plain></SENT>
