<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: R banding technique for karyotype analysis, in vitro semi-solid culture for CFU-GM growth patterns, flow cytometry after monoclonal antibody labeling for proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, flow cytometry after in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation for cell cycle kinetics analysis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> HUMARA gene polymorphism assay for hematopoiesis clonality analysis were carried out in 37 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 31% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation occurred in 2 of 9 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 3 of 5 with abnormal chromosomal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean CFU-GM colony yield was decreased and cluster yield increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease progression in 6 of 9 with more CFU-GM cluster yields, while only 1 of 9 with either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or no CFU-GM yields transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentages of PCNA-positive BMMNCs were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (44.22% vs 26.82%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean BrdU labeling index of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells was lower (5.07%), the mean DNA synthesis time (Ts) and potential doubling time(Tpot) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were longer than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (p &lt; 0.01), and the increased Ts and T pot were related to the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal pattern of BMMNCs was detected in 5 of 7 heterozygous female RA patients and the other 2 were polyclonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 RAEB and 1 MDS/AML were monoclonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With disease progressing and bone marrow blasts increasing, the biological nature of the hamatopoetic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibited a tendency to transformation as follows: hematopoiesis converting into clonal, in vitro CFU-GM growth pattern approaching leukemic, PCNA expression increasing, and cell cycle prolonging </plain></SENT>
