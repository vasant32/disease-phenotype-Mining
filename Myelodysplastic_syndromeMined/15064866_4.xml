<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is the investigation of the frequency of MLL gene rearrangements in cases of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of MLL gene rearrangements was performed by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal karyotypic abnormalities were found in 15/50 (30%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11q23 abnormalities were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and a complex karyotype presented a del (11)(q13); further analysis by FISH revealed loss of one copy of MLL gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Southern blot revealed germline bands in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases using Eco RI and in 61/62 cases with Bam HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and a del (11)(q13) revealed a rearranged band following only Bam HI digestion, but not Eco RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of MLL gene within exons 5-9 were not identified in this series of adult de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, indicating that this molecular abnormality is not involved in the pathogenesis of this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemopoietic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
