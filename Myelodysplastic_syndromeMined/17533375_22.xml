<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a part of the AML1 complex and activates AML1-mediated transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, chromosomal translocations and mutations of HIPK2 have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we screened mutations of the HIPK2 gene in 50 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and in 80 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicated there were two missense mutations (R868W and N958I) in the speckle-retention signal (SRS) domain of HIPK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localization analyses indicated that the two mutants were largely localized to nuclear regions with conical or ring shapes, and were somewhat diffused in the nucleus, in contrast to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, which were mainly localized in nuclear speckles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutations impaired the overlapping localization of AML1 and HIPK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutants showed decreased activities and a dominant-negative function over <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein in AML1- and p53-dependent transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that dysfunction of HIPK2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
