<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the recent efforts to identify pathogens, effector cells and soluble cell products involved in the development of this syndrome only a few comprehensive experimental data are available, useful for elaboration of therapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a patient with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> who was refractory to inductive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial agar gel culture studies revealed the activity of hematopoiesis inhibitory T cells within the bone marrow that could be suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However another pathological cell features, the excess of an unusual lympho-reticular cell complexes was identified in long-term liquid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These symbiotic cell complexes persisted throughout the disease, despite the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> induced hematological remission, suggesting their causative role in the disease, that more recently progressed towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
