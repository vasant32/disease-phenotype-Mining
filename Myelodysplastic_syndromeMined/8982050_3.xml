<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed no increase in cytokine levels in serum or in the conditioned medium (CM) of peripheral T cells cultured with or without IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When bone marrow (BM) cells were cultured with GM-CSF, IL-3 and SCF in a semisolid system, the colonies were exclusively eosinophilic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of the colony cells identified the same chromosome abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases to that of BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suspension and clonogenic colony assay of BM cells cultured with various cytokines showed predominant eosinophilic growth and differentiation with GM-CSF, but not with the other cytokines examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with mild morphological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001879'>abnormalities of eosinophils</z:hpo>, indicate clonal involvement of eosinophils in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) clone, and that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> was derived from the neoplastic clone with the translocation and was not associated with the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
