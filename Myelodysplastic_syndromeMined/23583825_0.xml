<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that reversing the sequence of administration (from (T)BU/CY to CY/(T)BU) will reduce SOS and day +100 non-relapse mortality (NRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (n=20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, n=20), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, n=11) in a prospective trial of CY/(T)BU conditioning for HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg/day IV for two days was followed by daily IV BU for four days, targeted to a concentration at steady state (Css) of 800-900 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CY/(T)BU-conditioned patients had higher exposure to CY (p&lt;0.0001) and lower exposure to 4-hydroxyCY (p&lt;0.0001) compared to (T)BU/CY-conditioned patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were compared with controls (n=271) conditioned with (T)BU/CY for the same indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, CY/(T)BU conditioning was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of SOS (0% vs. 30% after (T)BU/CY, p=0.006), while SOS incidence was low in both cohorts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Day +100 mortality was significantly lower in the CY/(T)BU cohort (2% vs. 13%, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CY/(T)BU conditioning markedly impacted CY pharmacokinetics and was associated with significantly lower incidences of SOS and day +100 mortality, suggesting that CY/(T)BU is superior to (T)BU/CY as conditioning for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
