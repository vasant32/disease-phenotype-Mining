<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth-inhibiting cytokines, the Fas/FasLigand pathway, and autoreactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have been identified to be important proapoptotic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrin-mediated interactions between progenitors and fibronectin are critical for progenitor cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have used flow cytometry to quantify the expression levels of members of the beta1 integrin family on CD34(+) marrow progenitors in 27 untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, three with s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and 25 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we observed that nonapoptotic progenitors significantly downregulate cell surface expression levels of alpha4 and beta1 integrin chains compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of alpha4, beta1, and also alpha5 was present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with &gt; or =25% apoptotic progenitors, irrespective of their French, American, British subcategory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced cell surface expression levels of alpha4, alpha5, and beta1 did also correlate with decreased in vitro adhesiveness to fibronectin fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our observations suggest that downregulation of alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins on CD34(+) progenitors could be a newly identified proapoptotic mechanism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
