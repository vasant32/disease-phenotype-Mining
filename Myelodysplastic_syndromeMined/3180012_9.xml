<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with an abnormal karyotype, 46,XY,t(5;12)(q31;p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the FAB cooperative group classification, the patient was classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the particular chromosomal translocation, the structure-function relationship of three genes relevant to the translocation breakpoints, CSF2, FMS, and KRAS2, was studied in bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No major structural alterations were observed at these three genetic loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the levels of expression of the CSF2 and FMS genes remained unaltered, the KRAS2 oncogene was overexpressed approximately six-fold in bone marrow cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> oncogene activation may be instrumental in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
