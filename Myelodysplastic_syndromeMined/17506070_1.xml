<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 34 (range, 17-72) and median neutrophil count 0.280 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trilineage hematologic recovery (at a median interval of 105 days from treatment) was seen in 46 patients (37 complete, 9 partial) after one (n = 38) or two (n = 8) courses of ALG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in three unresponders, clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> in three complete responders, and relapse of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in four complete responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow up for surviving patients was 1,668 days (range, 237-4,012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival at 5 years was 82%, falling to 77.1% at 7 years and was stationary at 7 and 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was not influenced by the neutrophil count (72% vs. 87%, for neutrophils less than vs. greater than 0.2 x 10(9)/L; P = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive treatment of SAA with the 4-drug combination appears to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significant prognostic effect of an enduring increase of the white blood cell (WBC) count during G-CSF treatment may suggest complete and partial response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In nonresponders, the WBC count either did not change or elevated values gradually returned to nearly their initial levels while the patients were still under G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients not responsive to treatment but living under CyA and G-CSF, the possibility of developing cytogenetic abnormalities does not seem to be low, despite the absence of findings attributable to manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
