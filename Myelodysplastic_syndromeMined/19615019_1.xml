<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although not commonly reported in LC, the presence of S-100 protein positivity and cytophagocytosis should not lead to the premature exclusion of LC as a possible diagnosis until a thorough clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of cytophagocytosis has been shown to have prognostic significance for patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
