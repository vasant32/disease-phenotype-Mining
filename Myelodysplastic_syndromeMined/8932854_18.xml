<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), infusions of donor mononuclear cells (MNC) provide a potent graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (GVL) reaction inducing complete remissions in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the efficacy of donor MNC infusions for patients who relapse with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied the GVL effects of donor MNC in eight patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> achieved complete remission and another patient had a transient response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of six non-responders died of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one non-responder died of complications during second BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed grade I-II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD responsive to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data, and review of the literature, suggest that GVL induction with donor MNC infusions is less effective for patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> than for patients with relapsed <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; too few patients with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been treated to draw definite conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, some patients respond, and given the high mortality associated with alternative procedures such as second BMT, donor MNC infusions are a reasonable approach for relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
