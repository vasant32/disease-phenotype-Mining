<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterize the romiplostim dose-response in subjects with low or intermediate-1 risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) receiving subcutaneous romiplostim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 44 MDS subjects receiving subcutaneous romiplostim (dose range 300-1500 μg week(-1) ) were used to develop a pharmacodynamic model consisting of a romiplostim-sensitive progenitor cell compartment linked to the peripheral blood compartment through four transit compartments representing the maturation in the bone marrow from megakaryocytes to platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A kinetics of drug effect model was used to quantify the stimulatory effect of romiplostim on the proliferation of sensitive progenitor cells and pharmacodynamics-mediated disposition was modelled by assuming the kinetics of drug effect constant (kDE ) to be proportional to the change in platelet count relative to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated values (between subject variability) for baseline platelet count, mean transit time, and kDE were 24 × 10(9)  l(-1) (47%), 9.6 days (44%) and 0.28 days(-1) , respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects had a shorter platelet lifespan (42 h) than healthy subjects (257 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Romiplostim effect was described for responders (78%) and non-responders (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average weekly stimulatory effect of romiplostim on the production rate of sensitive progenitor cells at baseline was 269% per 100 μg week(-1) for responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight, age, gender and race were not statistically related to romiplostim pharmacodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual predictive checks confirmed the model adequacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The time course of platelet counts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects receiving subcutaneous administration of escalating doses of romiplostim was characterized and showed a linear dose-response for romiplostim responders to increase the platelet counts </plain></SENT>
