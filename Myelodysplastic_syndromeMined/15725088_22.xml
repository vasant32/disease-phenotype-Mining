<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the influence of cell subsets [CD34, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD20, natural killer (NK; CD3(-)/CD56(+)), NKT (CD3(+)/CD56(+)), DC1, and DC2 cells] of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on early T-cell chimaerism and later clinical outcomes in 125 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> who received human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related grafts after non-myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) alone (n = 28), or 2 Gy TBI preceded by either 90 mg/m(2) fludarabine (n = 62) or planned autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant immunosuppression included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that higher numbers of grafted NK cells predicted higher early T-cell chimaerism (P = 0.03), while higher numbers of B cells were associated with better clinical outcomes and a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher numbers of CD14(+) cells were associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.03), while higher numbers of CD34(+) cells showed better survival (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of fludarabine or autologous HCT predicted higher early T-cell chimaerism (P = 0.001), while advanced donor age predicted lower chimaerism (P &lt; or = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive diseases</z:e> were at higher risk for relapse/disease progression, and shorter progression-free and overall survival (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the dosing of certain cellular subsets of PBSC products can influence important outcomes post-HCT after non-myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
