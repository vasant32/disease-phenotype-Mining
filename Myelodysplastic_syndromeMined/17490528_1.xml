<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">Amifostine</z:chebi> (AMF) was used alone (4/12) or combined with recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO) (8/12) in 12 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic regimen was adopted with AMF 0.4 g/day for 5 days, then took a break of 2 days and then went on for 3 weeks consecutively, that was reputed as one treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rh-EPO 6 000 U was used for 3 days per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 12 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attained hematological improvement in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11 cases showed major effective response rate (91.7%), while 1 case showed minor response rate (8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effective response rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, leukocytes and platelets was 100%, 75% and 58.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intervals of red cell transfusions (RCT) in 2 cases living on red cell transfusion before AMF treatment were prolonged after AMF treatments, and the amount of each RCT was decreased obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The side effect was usually discomfort of digestive system, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients can endure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">Amifostine</z:chebi> is a potential drug in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with safety especially to those elder patients who often suffered from other multiple organ disfunctions, and the curative effect will be improved by more treatment cycles </plain></SENT>
