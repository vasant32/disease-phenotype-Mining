<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the results of allogeneic HSCT in 38 children to determine which factors, if any, affected outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The effects of demographic, donor, and disease-related factors were analyzed to determine their effects on overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS), relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OS and DFS for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-year OS and EFS were the same (15.4 +/- 5.8%) and the 3-year NRM was 59.6 +/- 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year cumulative risk of grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and relapse were 23.7 +/- 7.0% and 18.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of pre-transplant bone marrow (BM) blasts was positively associated with relapse (P = 0.05), while the percentage of BM blasts at diagnosis of therapy-related disease tended to associate with NRM (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternative donor and matched sibling donor grafts had similar outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NRM was higher among patients who did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD as compared to those with grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (69.2 +/- 14.2% vs. +/- 12.7%, respectively), while NRM was 100% in patients with grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of BM blasts is associated with relapse in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High rates of NRM negatively impact the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for children with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on reducing NRM </plain></SENT>
