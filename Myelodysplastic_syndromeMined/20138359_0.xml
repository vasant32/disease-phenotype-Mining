<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 200 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients enrolled in our national registry during the years 2006-2008 to determine the scheme used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clear WHO subtypes were recorded for 45.0% of patients, compared to 5.5% for FAB subtypes; 28.0% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> documented but without WHO or FAB subtype, and for 22.5%, the schema was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients do not have a subtype or schema documented, when they do, the WHO system is widely used </plain></SENT>
