<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have reviewed cytogenetic data of 302 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed by karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 85 patients, del(5q) was only detected by karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients undergoing karyotypic evolution, the del(5q) and additional chromosomal aberrations were only detected by karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, del(5q) was only detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, but not by karyotyping due to a low number of metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping was significantly more sensitive than fluorescence in situ hybridization in detecting the del(5q) clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, to optimize therapy control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients with del(5q) treated with lenalidomide and to identify cytogenetic non-response or progression as early as possible, fluorescence in situ hybridization alone is inadequate for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping must be performed to optimally evaluate response </plain></SENT>
