<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been proven to be an important tool in interphase cytogenetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although, because of methodological implications, balanced aberrations are not detected by CGH, the technique has uncovered a variety of new and interesting imbalanced karyotype changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only a few studies deal with its application to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>, although this is a main topic of cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the usefulness of CGH in the examination of hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, bone marrow aspirates of 33 patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> were examined with CGH and the results compared with conventional cytogenetics (CC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CGH showed chromosome changes in 8 of 33 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CC found balanced aberrations in 4 of 33 and unbalanced changes in 9 of 33 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences between CGH and CC in unbalanced aberrations were seen in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these samples, either the number of aberrant cells found by CC was low and, therefore, difficult to detect by CGH, or complex aberrations in different cell clones as seen in CC were lumped together as one karyotype by CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one sample, CC was not capable of giving any results at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, whereas CGH showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CGH was also helpful in defining the bands involved in the structural aberrations, which was difficult by CC in some cases because of the low quality of metaphase spreads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results obtained by CGH were confirmed by FISH, whereas CC and FISH were discordant in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although CGH was not able to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aberrations, it gave important additional information for the correct localization of the aberrations found in CC, and it was most helpful in samples not processed successfully in CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These advantages would open up a new field of application for CGH not only for research, but also for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
