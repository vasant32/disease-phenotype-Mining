<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 27 patients initially diagnosed as refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with sideroblasts (RA-S) according to the FAB-classification a number of clinical, morphological and cytogenetic parameters were correlated for prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From these correlations it emerged that severe cytopenia is centrally positioned with regard to clinical course in RA and RA-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations were found to initial diagnosis, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, progression to RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), the percentage of bone marrow blast cells and prolonged half life for radioactively labeled iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, alone, was correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of abnormal karyotypes was inversely correlated to bone marrow cellularity and proportional to the frequency of bone marrow blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these relationships it may be proposed that chromosome abnormalities are associated with prolonged blast cell generation times and inhibition of blast cell maturation resulting in reduced marrow cellularity and blast cell accumulation, and, in the peripheral blood, falling percentages of neutrophil granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the blast cell accumulation the bone marrow cellularity again becomes hyperplastic and the preleukaemic condition is transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
