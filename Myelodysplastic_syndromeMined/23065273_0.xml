<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established a nested case-control study cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients (n = 435) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And 41 patients had conditions progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (case group = 41), 342 patients had no leukemic transformation (control group = 342), and 52 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cell of the patients in the case group and after the evolution were analyzed for the gene expression microarray test (self-control study), whereas the bone marrow mononuclear cell of the paired patients extracted at diagnosis were analyzed for the gene expression microarray test (case-control study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By incorporating the results of above two studies, we identified the genes related to the transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 958 deregulated genes were identified via bioinformatics analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analyses identified a subset of six genes that help distinguish between the case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These genes are TUBB, PSMD1, SLC7A5, ATG3, TUBB2C, and TIMM10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined gene expression microarray test and nested case-control study method identified a subset of six genes that help distinguish between the case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six genes may play critical roles in the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
