<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment options for FeLV are limited, associated with serious side effects, and can be cost-prohibitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of drugs used to treat a related retrovirus, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HIV-1), has been rapid, leading to the approval of five drug classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although structural differences affect the susceptibility of gammaretroviruses to anti-HIV drugs, the similarities in mechanism of replication suggest that some anti-HIV-1 drugs may also inhibit FeLV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the anti-FeLV activity of four drugs approved by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at non-toxic concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, tenofovir and raltegravir are anti-HIV-1 drugs, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> are approved to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, respectively, but also have anti-HIV-1 activity in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that these drugs may be useful for FeLV treatment and should be investigated for mechanism of action and suitability for veterinary use </plain></SENT>
