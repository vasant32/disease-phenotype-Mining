<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Marrow cells from 48 MDS patients and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied by interphase FISH using SpectrumRed directly labelled DNA specific probe for 5q31, 200 to 300 cells were scored for each case and cells with a red hybridization signal &gt; 6% were defined as -5/5q- positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference in the percentage of positive cells detected by the two methods was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
