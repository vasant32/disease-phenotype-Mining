<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The differentially expressed genes which were involved in the hematopoiesis were screened by microarray using CD34(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients firstly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RQ-PCR was then applied to validate the screened genes using CD34(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The linkages with hematopoiesis among these validated genes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the differentially expressed genes in CD34(+) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patients, Rap1GAP was up-regulated significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cadherins, which can interplay with Rap1, including N-cadherin and E-cadherin, were down-regulated significantly (P &lt; 0.01). β-catenin, a downstream effector of cadherins, was highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>c-myc binding protein was down-regulated (P &lt; 0.01), and c-myc promoter binding protein was up-regulated (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42, which belong to RhoGTPases family and are associated with the cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and hematopoiesis, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed highly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The abnormal expression of cadherin, β-catenin and c-myc associated genes were closely related to the dysplastic hematopoiesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The down regulation of cadherin was associated with the positive feedback mechanism between Rap1 and cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aberrant expression of Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 may contribute to the morphological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
