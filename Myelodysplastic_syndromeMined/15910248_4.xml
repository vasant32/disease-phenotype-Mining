<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, 32 patients receiving a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen (FBM) were compared to those in a control group of 23 patients treated with standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (BuCy; 14 patients) or TBI-based (TBI 12 Gy/VP16/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>; 9 patients) conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM was aspirated before conditioning, and at day +30 and/or at day +100, obtaining positive stromal cell growth in vitro in 58%, 47%, and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBM conditioning did not alter the ability of BM to generate stromal layers both early (day +30, 75%+) or late (day +100, 80%+) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as compared to pre-HCT (66.6%+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBM-treated patients formed confluent stroma significantly more often than standard-treated patients (85% vs. 38% patients; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an univariate analysis, standard conditioning remained the only factor predicting stromal growth impairment after allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo-generated stromal layers from 5 female, FBM treated, sex-mismatched, and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplanted patients were analyzed by combined FISH-Y and immunofluorescence stains (Vimentin, CD14, CD45) and found to be exclusively of recipient origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FBM reduced intensity conditioning results in reduced, if any, stromal damage as compared to standard myeloablative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The novel, donor-derived, hematopoiesis in FBM patients after allogeneic transplantation is supported and maintained by a host-derived BM stromal microenvironment </plain></SENT>
