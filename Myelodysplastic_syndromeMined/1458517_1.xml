<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify bone marrow (BM) cellular and humoral dysfunctions central to the development of MDPS and useful in therapeutic follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our preclinical studies have shown that (1) the characteristic stromal cell composition of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM microenvironment was impaired in MDPS and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 67 and 86% of the cases, respectively; (2) the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 concentration in BM plasma was abnormal in 50% of MDPS and 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; and (3) an inverse correlation existed in MDPS between the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 concentration and the frequency of F-CFU, (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.02), suggestive of a regulatory interaction between this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35788">secosteroid</z:chebi> hormone and BM stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of clonal extinction of BM blast cells in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA), 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, and colony stimulating factors (PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), either alone or in various combinations, revealed individual patterns of responses in the cases of MDPS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the necessity for preclinical studies to select patients for combined differentiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our ongoing clinical trials suggest that RA (Roaccutan, 20 mg/day continuously) as induction therapy, followed at weeks 6 to 8 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (40 mg/day for 15 days) and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">Rocaltrol</z:chebi>, 3 x 0.25 micrograms/day for 3 months) may induce a long-lasting hematological remission in MDPS </plain></SENT>
