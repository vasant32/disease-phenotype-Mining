<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 215 patients with a median age of 57 yr underwent allogeneic hematopoietic SCT for early (41%) or advanced (59%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 36 months a 10-yr survival estimate of 56 +/- 6% could be assessed for patients in early disease stages while patients with advanced diseases showed a significantly decreased survival probability of 31 +/- 5% (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplant related mortality (TRM) at day 100 and 365 post-transplant was 13% and 30% for early but increased to 21% and 49% for advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As major determinants of TRM advanced disease stage (p &lt; 0.0001) and occurrence of grades II-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (p &lt; 0.0001) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that hematopoietic SCT following myeloablative conditioning is also applicable to elderly patients whereas disease stage and high-grade GVHD represent the essential prognostic factors for outcome </plain></SENT>
