<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> is a rather <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> involving the skin and several other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the extent of extracutaneous manifestations in 14 adult patients who presented with prominent cutaneous involvement within the last 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cutaneous lesions were clinically diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007583'>telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans</z:hpo> in 2 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> pigmentosa of varying extent in 11 and diffuse erythrodermic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had extracutaneous manifestations with involvement of one additional organ system in 6/14 cases, two in 5/14 and three in 3/14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten out of 14 patients suffered from generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo>, and 11/14 reported mild wheal formation, while 3/14 with multi-organ involvement mentioned recurrent flushing episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gastro-intestinal tract was involved in 8/14 cases with an increase in gastric and colon mucosal mast cells in 5/8 cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastroduodenitis</z:e> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement was seen in 7/13 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease had a duration of 0.5-32 years, clinical symptoms remaining basically unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignant transformation</z:e> was not seen; only 1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> within 2 years after the first cutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that extracutaneous involvement should be carefully considered in adult patients with cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systemic multi-organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mast cell disease</z:e> in adults is a long-lasting disorder with recurrent episodes of varying clinical symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the disease shows rather <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory management is achieved by symptomatic oral drug intake </plain></SENT>
