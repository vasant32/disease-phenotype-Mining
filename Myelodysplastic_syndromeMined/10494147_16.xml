<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in atomic bomb survivors, leukemic cells were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on the basis of conventional G-banding in patients with a history of radiation exposure and also in de novo patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional G-banding showed higher incidences (p &lt; 0.005) of structural and numerical abnormalities without any specific types of chromosome aberrations in the group exposed to a dose of more than one Gy, compared to the non-exposed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis revealed significantly higher incidences (P &lt; 0.05) of subclones with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and deletion of the 20q13.2 region, which were not found in conventional cytogenetic analysis in the exposed group (more than one Gy) compared to the non-exposed controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, segmental jumping translocation (SJT) of the c-MYC gene region was observed only in the exposed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> suggested that the leukemic cells from the heavily exposed patients contained persistent cellular genetic instability which may strongly influence the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in people exposed to radiation </plain></SENT>
