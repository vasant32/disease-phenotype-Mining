<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significant toxicity of topotecan administered at a dose of 2mg/m2 i.v. daily for 5 days as a continuous infusion limits its use in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied topotecan 1.5mg/m2 per day i.v. over 2 h for three consecutive days in 20 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (12 RAEB; 4 RAEB-T; 4 CMMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cycles were given every 4-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient achieved a durable complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within the first cycle of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> was the most common toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grades 3-4 infections were documented in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that topotecan administered at this dose and schedule has no clinically significant activity </plain></SENT>
