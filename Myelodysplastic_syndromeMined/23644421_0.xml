<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation, seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, hypomethylating agents (HMA) like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> have been successfully used in clinical trials and achieved approval from health authorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is now growing evidence suggesting that the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action might offer a potential benefit to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is especially done with the intention to synergize the positive effects of each drug on the defective hematopoiesis while sparing potential side effects and toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination of HMA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors, although mechanistically very tempting, have not yielded convincing improvement of the results in the majority of trials compared to single agent HMA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, combination therapies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> with lenalidomide appear to be promising thus making them an appealing option for treatment in these patients.<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> accepted article preview online, 6 May 2013; doi:10.1038/leu.2013.140 </plain></SENT>
