<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were studied, 181 with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 45 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> (24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, sAML-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, sAML-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukaemic colony forming units (L-CFU) were assayed by plating peripheral blood (PB) blast cells in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl-cellulose</z:chebi> and using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>-PHA as stimulant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case parallel cultures were made with and without stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plating efficiency (PE) was defined as the number of clusters plus colonies/10(5) cells plated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autonomous growth (AG) was the number of colonies plus clusters growing without stimulant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autonomous proliferative index (API) was calculated as the number of clusters + colonies without stimulating factor divided by the number of clusters + colonies with stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the PE between de novo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autonomous growth was significantly higher in sAML-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FAB subtype M3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> displayed a significantly greater PE and a significantly lower API when compared with the other FAB subgroups (P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upon analysing the relationship with the immunophenotype, only CD33 expression showed a significant relationship with the in vitro growth pattern; CD33+ cases displayed a higher PE (P=0.0002) and AG (P=0.0003) than CD33- cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When patients were grouped according to the level of rh123 efflux (MDR1) it was observed that cases with &gt;30% elimination showed a higher AG and API than those with &lt;30% (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally we found that patients with higher API (&gt;0.05) displayed a significantly shorter overall survival as compared with patients with API&lt;0.05 (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The in vitro study properties of clonogenic cells produces relevant clinical information of leukaemic cell biology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
