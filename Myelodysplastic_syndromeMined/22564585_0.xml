<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their clinical impact on HSCT outcomes is controversial due to complexity of KIR haplotypes, genotypes, and phenotypes as well as their diversity among patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the role of KIR-ligand interactions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The recipient cohort, which included patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction - sequence specific oligo probes (PCR-SSO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The KIR genotype of the donors and the ligands C1 (Asparagine 80), C2 (Lysine 80), and Bw4 recipient typings were performed using polymerase chain reaction - sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), relapse, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While 84.5% of donors carried a Bx KIR, 15.5% carried the AA haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of a recipient's lack of ligands among 88.5% of cases was associated with 39% of subjects developing GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of C1 may lead to manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD and lack of C2 to manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of both C1 and C2 seemed to be protective against both forms of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of two Bw4 alleles, threonine (T) or isoleucine (I) at position 80, was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>73% of recipients who carried Bw4 80(I) versus 27% with the Bw4 80(T) allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of Bw4-80(T) allele appeared to reduce the risk of GvHD, indicating its stronger inhibitory effect than its 80(I) counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KIR-ligand interactions influenced HSCT outcomes </plain></SENT>
