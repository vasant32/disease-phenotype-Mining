<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients demographics and clinical features at diagnosis were analysed for their prognostic value on survival and on risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range 21-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to FAB criteria there were 30 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 3 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 18 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 6 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) and 5 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients had evaluable cytogenetic analysis: the most frequent karyotypic change was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 (10%), followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (6%); partial chromosome deletions and translocations were also common abnormalities, occurring on the whole in 16% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 15 months 19 patients (31%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From univariate analysis we identified some features, which appeared to be predictive of outcome and risk of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age above 40 years (p = 0.002) and high risk according to IPSS score (p = 0.002) were found to be predictive for a shorter survival; FAB grouping (p = 0.0001), percentage &gt; 5% of blasts in the bone marrow (p = 0.001) and high risk by IPSS score (p = 0.0003) were found to be predictive for a higher risk of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presenting features in young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may identify subjects at higher risk of unfavourable outcome </plain></SENT>
