<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormality present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases consisted of a tandem triplication of a portion of the long arm of chromosome #1, resulting in tetrasomy of a section of this chromosome ( 1q21 -32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplications of this portion of chromosome #1 were observed as a nonrandom event in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599849" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant states</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, these precise breakpoints can be increasingly correlated with tandem duplications </plain></SENT>
