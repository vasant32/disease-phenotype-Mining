<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy and safety of autologous serum eye drops for the treatment of severe dry eye after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 patients (four males and 10 females; median age, 31.0 years) with severe dry eye associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (cGVHD) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were refractory to treatment with conventional artificial tears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous serum eye drops, a solution made of 20% autologous serum in <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> saline, were applied 10 times per eye per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated every 4 weeks according to visual acuity, corneal sensitivity, vital staining of the ocular surface, tear dynamics, and subjective assessments of symptoms (complaints scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 19.4 months (range: 4-41 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of treatment, significant improvement was observed in both complaint scores (from 33.7+/-12.3 to 23.6+/-10.6 points; P&lt;0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> scores (from 5.8+/-2.0 to 2.4+/-0.9 points; P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were observed also in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose-bengal</z:chebi> staining and tear break-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven of the 14 patients, the responses were maintained for 6-41 months (median:19.4+/-8.3 months), while six of the other seven patients required treatment with punctal plugs in addition to autologous serum eye drops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of these other seven patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo> around the eyelids, after which the treatment was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that autologous serum eye drops are safe and effective for treating severe dry eye associated with cGVHD and that more efficient control of dry eye may be achieved by the combined use of autologous serum eye drops with punctal plugs </plain></SENT>
