<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Large volumes of bone marrow and other tissue receive considerable exposure, but few studies have quantified late carcinogenic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 61 2-year survivors of NHL treated initially with low-dose TBI was monitored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on primary and subsequent therapy were collected, and cumulative dose of radiation to active bone marrow (ABM) (median, 5.2 Gy) was reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), which represents a relative risk (RR) of 117 (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.5 to 300) compared with population rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fifth patient was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> subsequently received salvage treatment, with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> alone (n = 1) or combined modality therapy (CMT) (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> were observed (RR = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9 to 4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 15-year cumulative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary ANLL</z:e> were 37% and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of subjects, a considerable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was observed among patients treated with low-dose TBI in combination with CMT including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, approximately eight to nine excess ANLLs might be expected to occur among 100 NHL patients treated with low-dose TBI and salvage treatment and followed-up for 15 years </plain></SENT>
