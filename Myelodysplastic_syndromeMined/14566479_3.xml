<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Total body irradiation (TBI) with and without additional radioimmunotherapy (RIT) was examined for renal toxicity after stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels of 35 patients (15 female, 20 male, median age 40.5 years, range 17-60 years) after TBI alone and of 23 patients (eight female, 15 male, median age 47, range 16-58 years) after TBI with additional RIT were determined between 10/1997 and 11/1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TBI was performed by external-beam radiotherapy in six fractions over 3 days with renal doses of 12 Gy in the TBI-alone group and 6 Gy in the group with additional RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean kidney dose due to the (188)Re-radiolabeled antibody was estimated to be 8.3 Gy (2.3-11.6 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 12 months after treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels increased from 77 mmol/l (SD +/- 11) to 89 mmol/l (SD +/- 20) for TBI alone and from 78 mmol/l (SD +/- 13) to 144 mmol/l (SD +/- 52) for combined TBI and RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite a 50% reduction of the external-beam contribution to the kidney dose, the application of approximately 10 GBq (188)Re-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody with a calculated renal dose of 8.3 Gy (range 2.3-11.5 Gy) led to renal toxicity, as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a positive dose-response relationship for the (188)Re-labeled antibody, the observation may be explained by an underestimation of the biologically effective dose and the inaccuracy of the dose determination at the glomerular level </plain></SENT>
