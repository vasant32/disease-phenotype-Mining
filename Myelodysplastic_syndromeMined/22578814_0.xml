<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">Alkylating agents</z:chebi> have shown activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine, an active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, was given in a fractionated twice daily schedule for 4 days to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with bendamustine at a starting dose of 50 mg/m(2) IV over 1-2 hours twice daily for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose escalations were by 25 mg/m(2) in the 1st 3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study used the 3 + 3 design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 57 years; the median salvage number was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 2 creatinine elevations were observed in 1 of 6 patients at the 50 mg/m(2) dose, in 2 of 13 patients at the 75 mg/m(2) dose, and in 3 of 6 patients at the 100 mg/m(2) dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was considered significant, even though DLT was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient achieved marrow complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions of marrow blasts (50% or more) were observed in 6 of 25 patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bendamustine fractionated dose level of 100 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days (800 mg/m(2) per course) was associated with Grade 2 renal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The proposed phase II schedule is 75 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies should evaluate this schedule in less heavily treated patients </plain></SENT>
