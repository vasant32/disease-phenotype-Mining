<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The methylation pattern of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> genes, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and DXS255 detected by hypervariable M27 beta probe, was analysed to determine the proportion of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) with clonal haematopoiesis in Japanese children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis was performed on DNA from separated granulocytes and compared to that of bone marrow derived fibroblasts to exclude selective lyonization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> somatic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 20 female patients examined, the methylation pattern of at least one gene was informative in granulocyte DNA from 18 patients (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8/20 patients (40%) were heterozygous for PGK, 8/18 (44%) were heterozygous for HPRT and 17/18 (94%) were heterozygous for DXS255 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14/18 patients both alleles were equally methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients exhibited a unilateral methylation pattern in their granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same unilateral pattern was again demonstrated in fibroblasts from two of the four patients suggesting that in the latter one X chromosome was selectively inactivated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the somatic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients showed a unilateral methylation pattern that was restricted to their granulocytes, suggesting the existence of true clonal haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They responded well to antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and presently have no evidence of a clonal disorder such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although these results indicate that some children with AA exhibit clonal haematopoiesis, analysis of a greater number of subjects will be required to establish the clinical value of clonal haematopoiesis in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
