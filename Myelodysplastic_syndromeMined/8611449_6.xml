<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient's haematological recovery was rapid and maintained even after cessation of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the predominant chromosome clone 13q- in bone marrow cells disappeared in the fourth week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's improved bone marrow haemopoiesis and disappearance of the abnormal chromosome has continued to the present, 13 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of both trilineage response and abnormal chromosome disappearance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with cytokine(s) or steroids is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy might therefore be advantageous in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
