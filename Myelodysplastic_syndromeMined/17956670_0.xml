<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was observed by bone marrow examination; the immunophenotype was assayed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry; the chromosomal aberrations were detected by conventional chromosomal analysis and RT-multiplex nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that extramedullary <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> occurred before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of overt disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, this case had more than 30% blasts in bone marrow with meningeal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large-sized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells predominated morphologically over other cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry revealed the co-expression of myeloid antigens (cMPO, CD33 and CD117) and T-lymphoid antigens (cCD3, CD5, CD7, dual expression of CD4 and CD8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD43 and CD99 were strong positive which define the earliest hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene could be detected with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> above-mentioned results led to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemia</z:hpo> is an uncommon type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> which may be preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and has aggressive clinical and biological behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular analysis can contribute to early diagnosis of BAL and evaluation of prognosis </plain></SENT>
