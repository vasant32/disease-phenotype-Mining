<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a group of clonal stem/progenitor cell diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially in the early stages, represents a particular challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to develop a multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) method to analyze the immunophenotypic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and establish a FCM scoring system to evaluate its potential for the diagnosis, classification, and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 41 bone marrow samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 30 bone marrow samples from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were subjected to multiparametric flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROC curve and Spearman's correlation analysis were performed to combine the results of hematology, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and cytogenetic analyses of these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the proportion of blasts and the expression of antigens on cell populations, we established a BM FCM scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The system has a good correlation rate (p = 0.006) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis; the 95% confidence interval was 0.921 - 0.997 and the sensitivity and specificity were 90.2% and 86.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BM FCM scores of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group was significantly higher than the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were positive correlations between FCM scores and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classification, karyotype, and IPSS and WPSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have established a BM FCM scoring system that may provide a useful adjunct to existing tests for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
