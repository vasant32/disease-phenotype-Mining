<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine these associations, multivariate models for six self-reported QOL outcomes at 6 and 12 months were constructed, considering pre-transplantation clinical status and QOL, and subsequent clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes measured overall subjective health, social functioning and agreement with statements such as 'Life has returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>.' Of 320 autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients who completed pre-transplantation surveys, 197 completed 6-month surveys and 175 completed 12-month surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-transplantation overall health and mental health were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> QOL outcomes at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline physical health was also predictive of four of six outcomes at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, disease risk was predictive only of enjoying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> were associated with poorer QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pre-transplantation self-reported physical and mental health are more strongly associated with QOL after HCT than commonly noted baseline clinical predictors such as age and disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of baseline QOL can help place the effects of the transplantation procedure in context </plain></SENT>
