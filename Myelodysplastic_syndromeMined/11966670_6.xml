<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Intravenous formulations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> have recently become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> is used frequently in children as part of a myeloablative regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation, pharmacokinetic data on intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in children are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics in children and to suggest a limited sampling strategy in order to determine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> systemic exposure with the minimum of inconvenience and risk for the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma pharmacokinetics after the first administration was investigated in six children using nonlinear mixed effect modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics showed little variability and were described adequately with a one-compartment model (population estimates CL,av=0.29 l h(-1) kg(-1); V,av=0.84 l kg(-1); t(1/2)=1.7-2.8 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined with limited sampling and a Bayesian fitting procedure, the model can adequately estimate the systemic exposure to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, which in children appears to be at the lower end of the adult range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi> systemic exposure in children during intravenous administration can be estimated adequately with limited sampling and a Bayesian fitting procedure from a one-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics in children should be the subject of more research </plain></SENT>
