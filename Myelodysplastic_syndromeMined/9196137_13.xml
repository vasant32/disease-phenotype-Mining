<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1978, the German-Austrian trials for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220644" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood HD</z:e> have used combined chemoradiotherapy without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The risk of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (SHM) was assessed in the total cohort of 667 children treated in four consecutive German-Austrian trials between 1978 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary chemotherapy for stages IA/B and IIA consisted of two cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, procarbazine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (OPPA) or OPA (without procarbazine) and, for more advanced stages, of two cycles of OPPA or OPA plus two, four, or six cycles of COPP or COMP (C, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>; M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was given in the first study to extended fields, and in later trials to involved fields only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 591 patients, only primary therapy was given; 76 patients (11%) needed additional salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 15 years is 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SHM developed in 5 of 667 patients: four <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated cumulative risk for SHM at 15 years is 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapy was a significant risk factor for SHM (relative risk, 7.25; P = .03), whereas age, sex, stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, splenectomy, and amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed risk of SHM is smaller than in other studies (adults and children) in which chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (MOPP) was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference can be attributed to the lower cumulative doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> in the chemotherapy, and the small number of patients who needed salvage therapy in the presented cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In general, differences in the incidence of SHM after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> reflect complex differences between treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
