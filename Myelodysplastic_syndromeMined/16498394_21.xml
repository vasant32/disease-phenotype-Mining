<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop a quantitative flow-cytometry approach to its evaluation, we analyzed the expression of CD71, CD105, cytosolic H-ferritin (HF), cytosolic L-ferritin (LF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ferritin (MtF) in erythroblasts from 104 MDS patients, 69 pathologic control patients and 19 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six-parameter, 4-color flow cytometry was employed, and data were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with pathologic and healthy controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had higher expression of HF (P &lt; 0.001) and CD105 (P &lt; 0.001), and lower expression of CD71 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MtF was specifically detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with ringed sideroblasts, and there was a close relationship between its expression and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining (r = 0.89, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro cultures of myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors showed that both HF and MtF were expressed at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation, and that MtF expression is specifically related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A classification function based on expression levels of HF, CD71 and CD105 allowed us to correctly classify &gt; 95% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This flow-cytometry approach provides an accurate quantitative evaluation of erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and allows a reliable diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo>, and may therefore be a useful tool in the work-up of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
