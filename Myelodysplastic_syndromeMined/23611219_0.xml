<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And to analyze cytogenetic aberration of MSC derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC) and its mechanism in pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adherent MSC from both myelodysplastic (n = 22) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 7) marrow were obtained by a stromal culture procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological features were observed by optical microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell-surface antigens were performed by flow cytometer(FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of MSC were identified under specific induction conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Standard cytogenetic analysis of both hematopoietic cells and MSC were performed by trypsin-Giemsa (GTG) banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The karyotype analysis DNA content was determined by FCM to verify the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC was typical slender spindle-shaped cells, MSC obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had a MSC immunophenotype, lacked the expression of hematopoietic antigens-CD34, CD45 and expressed MSC markers, such as CD73, CD90, and CD105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC layers showed the capability to differentiate towards adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic aberrations were observed in MSC from 14 (64%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, usually involve the loss of chromosomal material (92%), and the clonal loss (7 cases, 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two cases of structural aberrations were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotypes in MSC were still more frequently identified in abnormal hematopoietic cells group (12 out of 13, 92% vs 3 out of 9, 33%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were not exactly the same type of chromosomal aberrations between hematopoietic cells and MSC, but different type of the aberrations in the same chromosome were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC retains the phenotyping characteristics and differentiated function of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC, but has different type of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of loss of chromosomal may be a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Detection of abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC suggests enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This may indicate potential involvement of MSC in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
