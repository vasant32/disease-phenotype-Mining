<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Double minutes (dmin)-circular, extra-chromosomal amplifications of specific acentric DNA fragments-are relatively frequent in malignant disorders, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), dmin are observed in approximately 1% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of them consist of an amplified segment from chromosome band 8q24, always including the MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides this information, little is known about their internal structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have characterized in detail the genomic organization of 32 AML and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with MYC-containing dmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The minimally amplified region was shown to be 4.26 Mb in size, harboring five known genes, with the proximal and the distal amplicon breakpoints clustering in two regions of approximately 500 and 600 kb, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in 23 (68%) of the studied cases, the amplified region was deleted in one of the chromosome 8 homologs at 8q24, suggesting excision of a DNA segment from the original chromosomal location according to the 'episome model' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case, sequencing of both the dmin and del(8q) junctions was achieved and provided definitive evidence in favor of the episome model for the formation of dmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression status of the TRIB1 and MYC genes, encompassed by the minimally amplified region, was assessed by northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TRIB1 gene was found over-expressed in only a subset of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases, whereas MYC, contrary to expectations, was always silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study, therefore, strongly suggests that MYC is not the target gene of the 8q24 amplifications </plain></SENT>
