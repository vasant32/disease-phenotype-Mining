<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now know that nuclear PLCbeta1 is a key player in the control of cell cycle progression; in fact it appears to be involved in the cyclin-mediated regulation of the physiological machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the recent discovery of a possible involvement of the interstitial deletion of PLCbeta1 gene in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in humans (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) strengthens this contention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Albeit several papers have reported the techniques used for the study of inositide-dependent signaling in the nucleus, we describe here step by step protocols, which can be followed for the preparation of highly purified nuclei and the subsequent analysis of nuclear PLCbeta1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The described techniques range from nuclear purification to enzymatic activity and to molecular biology methods </plain></SENT>
