<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the majority of patients lack HLA-identical sibling donors (SD), unrelated donor (UD) transplantation is performed increasingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis, we have reviewed our experience with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, comparing related and unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From November, 1997, to February, 2002, 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> received allogeneic SCT after various RIC regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 had a related donor, and the remaining 20 had an unrelated donor (UD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable with respect to age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a trend toward higher rate of graft failure in the unrelated donor group with 11% compared to 3% in the related donor group (p = 0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) II-IV was 36% in the RD group versus 44% for the UD group; severe GVHD III-IV occurred in 26% and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were more serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in the unrelated donor group with 25% compared to 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality was 13% (RD group) versus 30% (UD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 21 months, progression-free survival was 30% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan Meier estimate of overall survival was 40% (RD) and 30% (UD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found no statistically significant difference regarding progression free and overall survival, despite a trend for more graft failure and increased transplant-related complications associated with the use of stem cells from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
