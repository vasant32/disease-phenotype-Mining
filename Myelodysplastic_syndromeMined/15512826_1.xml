<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 85 cases have been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a case of a 77-year-old man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA), which preceded the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ultrasound guided biopsy revealed diffuse, large B-cell, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; subsequent staging revealed no other disease site, and the patient was considered to have primary adrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He received hormonal replacement and chemotherapy, but he succumbed to his disease because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and multi-organ failure a few days post diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature in which AIHA preceded bilateral adrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also provide a summary of the current data for the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
