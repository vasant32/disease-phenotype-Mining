<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stains were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from 17 GS lesions with lineage-associated markers: myeloperoxidase, CD68 (KP1), CD68 (PG-Ml), glycophorin A, factor VIII, and CD56; and with markers for blasts and immature myeloid cells: CD34 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that positive staining with PG-M1, but not KP1, suggests monocytic differentiation of myeloid cells in GS and correlates with the monocytic differentiation of blasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD56 is frequent in GS, especially when the marrow blasts have monocytic differentiation, and should not be interpreted as a primary natural-killer cell process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immature myeloid cells in GS are frequently HLA-DR positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, CD34 positivity of the immature myeloid cells is relatively uncommon, except in cases with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
