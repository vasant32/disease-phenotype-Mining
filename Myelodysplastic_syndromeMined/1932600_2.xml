<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that transRA as a monotherapeutic agent induced a stable remission in APL at the third relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MDPS, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25D3) 13 cis RA induced a long-lasting hematological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially both patients had an impaired BM microenvironment which regenerated on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> therapy as judged by reappearance of the Hematon fraction in the BM aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our preclinical experiments using long-term liquid BM cultures (LTBMC) indicated that several individual patterns of growth and differentiation responses can be induced by combinations of transRA, 1 alpha,25D3 and hemopoietic growth factors (HGFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biological responses may vary from complete clonal extinction to a significant growth stimulation of the leukemic blast cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results further support the importance of preclinical studies in selecting "good" responders for, and excluding "poor" responders from protocols using differentiation therapy </plain></SENT>
