<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hypothesis were tested: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial 111In-platelet kinetics indicates the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> site (in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean platelet life span)/destruction site (in patients with shortened mean platelet life span), 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial 111In-platelet kinetics indicates the quality of platelet separation and labelling procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed initial labelled platelet kinetics in thrombocytopenic patients (in order to test the first hypothesis) as well as in control (healthy) subjects (in order to test the second hypothesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine persons were investigated: 33 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>: 25 with shortened mean platelet life span, caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> im mune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), eight with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet life span and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), six healthy, control subjects (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 39 persons platelet blood count on the day of platelet labelling was determined, autologous platelet labelling with 111In-oxinate was performed, general and differential yields of platelet labelling (GYL and DYL), as well as mean labelled platelets life span were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides that, initial labelled platelets kinetics was performed with initial 111In-platelets accumulation in the liver (IPAL) calculation, as well as the late platelet kinetics for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> index and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e>/destruction site determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We obtained two types of initial labelled platelets kinetics (not only in the patients with shortened platelet life span, but also in the subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> labelled platelets life span), which differed in the IPAL value and in the ratio of the liver and the heart radioactivity: IPAL &lt; 20% and IPAL&gt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant difference in GYL and DYL between the two groups: IPAL&lt;20% and IPAL &gt; 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both yields were higher in IPAL&lt;20% group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two IPAL groups in the platelet blood count, labelled platelet life span, sequestration index and sequestration site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation could be found between IPAL on one side and platelet blood count, sequestration index, and sequestration site on another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We concluded that initial labelled platelet kinetics could not indicate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e>/destructon site (which is accomplished by the late labelled platelets kinetics), but nevertheless, it is very sensitive and useful method of platelet separation and labelling quality control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While in vitro quality control parameters (GYL and DYL) indicate the quality of only one part of this procedure, initial labelled platelet kinetics reflects discrete platelet function disturbance that might happen from the moment of blood sample collection till the labelled platelets intravenous injection </plain></SENT>
