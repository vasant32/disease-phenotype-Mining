<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 446 Chinese healthy females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) or PCR-restriction enzyme digestion method was applied for detecting G6PD, P55, BTK and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHL</z:e>-1 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those heterozygotic loci were used as markers to examine the hematopoietic clonality of bone marrow mononuclear cells by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET) patients with JAK2V617F mutation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the total 446 genomic DNA samples, the frequencies of heterozygosity in G6PD, P55, BTK and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHL</z:e>-1 loci were 12.8%, 29.4%, 52.0% and 46.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 81.4% of females were heterozygous at one or more loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 ET patients with JAK2V617F mutation and 2 MDS patients with abnormal karyotype, which were heterozygotic in either locus, had monoclonal/oligoclonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clonality detection based on X chromosome inactivation patterns-transcription based clonality assays is applicable to about 80% of Chinese females </plain></SENT>
