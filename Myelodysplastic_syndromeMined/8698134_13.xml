<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients with AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the TPO concentrations were remarkably increased, and their glycocalicin concentrations were decreased compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, however, the TPO and glycocalicin levels were not changed as much as in the AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in spite of the same degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During immunosuppressive treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, there was an inverse relationship between the level of TPO and the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, measurements of TPO and glycocalicin levels are useful for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and our results from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients did not support the model which suggested the simple feedback regulation of TPO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
