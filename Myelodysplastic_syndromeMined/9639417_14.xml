<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A is a cell cycle regulatory protein that functions in mitotic and S phase control in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to other G1 phase regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein and p16INK4A, cyclin A seems not to be commonly involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a second human cyclin A--cyclin A1--has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to cyclin A which is expressed throughout embryonic development and in adult tissue, the expression of cyclin A1 has been reported to be restricted to embryonic and germ line cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the absence of cyclin A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood leukocytes of seven healthy donors by single step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have examined the expression of cyclin A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 173 peripheral blood samples of 162 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detectable in 11 of 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, three of three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>acute biphenotypic leukemia</z:hpo>, eight of eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 59 of 69 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) at diagnosis, 13 of 15 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in blastic transformation, 10 of 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, two of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e>, and only two of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) with both cyclin A1 RT-PCR positive ALL <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> being undifferentiated relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, cyclin A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in one of six leukapheresis products, harvested from individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, cyclin A1 is expressed in the majority of myeloid and undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cyclin A1, a protein potentially involved in G1/S phase progression of immature cells, might be necessary for proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells and their leukemic counterparts being blocked at that stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
