<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) have been reported frequently in patients with otherwise typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), but their implications in the prognosis and in the evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 127 adult AA patients who had successful cytogenetic analysis at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were classified into 3 groups according to the initial and follow-up results of cytogenetic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included patients who had persistent AA with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic profiles (N=117); Group 2, those who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic profile at initial diagnosis but later acquired CA (N=4, 3.1%); and Group 3, those who had CA at the initial diagnosis, regardless of follow-up cytogenetic status (N=6,4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, 2 patients later developed CA without progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); the other 2 patients later progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in Group 3 progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in overall survival between Groups 1 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AA patients with CA at initial diagnosis or follow-up may not be at greater risk for evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, or show shorter survival periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies and a larger patient samples are needed to establish the clinical relevance of CA </plain></SENT>
