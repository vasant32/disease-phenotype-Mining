<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose was 2 X 10(6) U/m2, with dose-limiting toxicity consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a well-tolerated dose of 1 X 10(6) U/m2, serum levels of rIL 2 of 30 U/ml were maintained for the duration of the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such concentrations sustain IL 2-dependent T cell growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> in patients receiving 1 X 10(6) U/m2 of rIL 2 following 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.0035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expanded T cell pool was polyclonal, as demonstrated by increases in both T4+ and T8+ T cell subsets, and activated, with statistically significant increases in IL 2 receptor (p = 0.043), in the absence of transferrin receptor induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cells were not detected in peripheral blood using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for alpha-interferon, no other lymphokines (beta- and gamma-interferon, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor) were present in serum during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reversible rises in anti-rIL 2 IgG antibodies occurred, as measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in the T cell mitogenic response to OKT3 and phytohemagglutinin, and no enhancement of cytotoxicity against natural killer-sensitive and resistant targets developed as a consequence of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for a partial response in a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, no antitumor activity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in vivo expansion of T cells with the capacity to respond to rIL 2 with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets provides impetus to ongoing trials exploring different routes and schedules of administration of rIL 2 </plain></SENT>
