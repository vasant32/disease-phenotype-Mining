<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population included both patients who had received no prior therapy (two patients), as well as patients refractory to primary therapy (five patients) and patients who had relapsed after achieving complete remission (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both previously untreated patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and two of the primarily refractory patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> following chemotherapy for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 55 years (range 36-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> were administered as 7-day continuous infusions at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant nonhematologic toxicity was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had a response as defined by bone marrow remission or improvement in transfusion requirement for red blood cells or platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although some patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> (six courses in five patients), none became aplastic, and eight courses in six patients were associated with increased bone marrow cellularity percentage of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five courses in three patients were inevaluable (one central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, one central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, three courses in one patient who refused bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> will be of benefit to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and there was no evidence of clinically significant induction of differentiation noted </plain></SENT>
