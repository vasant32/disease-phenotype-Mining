<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The aCGH detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> numerical chromosomal gains and losses from the mainline clones and 113 copy number alterations (CNAs) ranging from 0.257 to 102.519 megabases (Mb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant recurrent deletions of 5q (involving the RPS14 gene), 12p12.3 (ETV6 gene), 17p13 (TP53 gene), 17q11.2 (NF1 gene) and 20q, double minutes containing the MYC gene and segmental amplification involving the MLL gene were further characterized with defined breakpoints and gene contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic features of microdeletions at 17q11.2 were confirmed by FISH using targeted BAC clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aCGH also defined break points in a derivative chromosome 6, der(6)t(3;6)(q21.3;p22.2), and an isodicentric X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, chromosomally observed sideline clonal abnormalities in five cases were not detected by aCGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that an integrated cytogenomic analysis will be a better diagnostic scheme to delineate genomic contents of chromosomal and cryptic abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An evidence-based approach to interpret somatic genomic findings was proposed </plain></SENT>
