<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated the predictive value of index measures, known as research population data, for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood cell counts were performed in samples from 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 199 healthy blood donors using the Beckman Coulter LH750 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Means and standard deviations of volume, conductivity and scatter of lymphocytes and neutrophils were evaluated as predictors for both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their specificity and selectivity were evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Research population data were significantly different among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, standard deviations of lymphocytes scatter and volume showed most relevant differences in comparison to healthy blood donors (sensitivity 88.6%, specificity 84.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, standard deviations of neutrophils conductivity were most predictive (sensitivity 73.7%, specificity 93.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Areas under corresponding receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.941 and 0.951, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on their high predictive value, research population data could be routinely used to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
