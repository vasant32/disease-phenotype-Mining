<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were diagnosed from 1 September to 31 October 1992 and from 1 August to 31 October 1993 in the 32 hospitals enrolled in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277553" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic Disorders</z:e> of Hematopoietic Organs Research Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and hospital-matched controls were selected for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on cigarette smoking and drinking habits, hair dye use, history of keeping pet animals, and occupational exposures to organic solvents, lead and radiation was obtained from self-administered questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was applied to this individually matched case-control study and odds ratios (ORs) were computed to estimate association between each exposure variable and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcohol drinking was associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (OR = 2.15; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-4.16) and there was a significant trend in risk with increasing amounts of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumed per week (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found elevated ORs for cigarette smokers (OR = 1.80), users of hair dye products (OR = 1.77), and workers exposed to organic solvents (OR = 1.50), although these ratios were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure to pet animals was not associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association observed between alcohol drinking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was still eminent even after adjusted with other variables of cigarette smoking, hair dye use and occupational exposure to organic solvents, and the dose-response relationship was also confirmed </plain></SENT>
