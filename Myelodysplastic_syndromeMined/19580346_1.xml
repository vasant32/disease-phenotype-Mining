<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population with varying degrees of commitment and maturation to several cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), this population is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the major cell types found in the blast gate by flow cytometry in newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, compared them to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM and studied their variation according to WHO type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two subsets defined by SSC were found both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, corresponding to myeloblasts and B-cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of B-cell precursors among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells was equally low, independent of WHO type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the subset with an intermediate SSC, but CD117, CD13 and CD19 negative increased with the rise of myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the ratio between CD34+/CD117+/CD34-/CD117+ cells was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two features are consistent with the maturation block occurring in the progression of the neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the quantitative analysis of the cell types present in the BM blast gate by flow cytometry is not only important for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in patients with peripheral cytopenias and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, but gives also important prognostic information of the patients </plain></SENT>
