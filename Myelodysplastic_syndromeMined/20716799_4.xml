<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transferrin receptor (CD71) mediates the uptake of transferrin-iron complexes and is highly expressed on the surface of cells of the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although CD71 has been used for flow cytometric analysis, its usefulness in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study defined the immunohistochemical profile of CD71, as compared with glycophorin A (CD235a) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, in 65 bone marrow biopsy specimens, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow specimens and cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for CD71 was restricted to erythroid precursors in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dyspoietic marrow samples and exhibited a membranous and cytoplasmic staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of mature erythrocytes lack expression of CD71, greatly facilitating interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD71 is a highly effective marker for the detection of cells of erythroid lineage in bone marrow biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
