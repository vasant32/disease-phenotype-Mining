<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was performed to examine the characteristics of transplant activity for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) older than 50 years within the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and to evaluate the factors predicting outcome within this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of 1,333 MDS patients age 50 years or older who received transplantation within the EBMT since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median recipient age was 56 years, with 884 patients (66%) age 50 to 60 years and 449 (34%) patients older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 811 HLA-matched sibling (61%) and 522 (39%) unrelated donor transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hundred patients (38%) received standard myeloablative conditioning (SMC), and 833 (62%) received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 4-year estimate for overall survival of the whole cohort was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, use of RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.84; P &lt; .01) and advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.93; P &lt; .01) were associated with an increased relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.79; P = .01), use of an unrelated donor (P = .03), and RIC (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; P = .03) were independent variables associated with nonrelapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.83; P &lt; .01) was the major independent variable associated with an inferior 4-year overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation remains a potential curative therapeutic option for many older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, disease stage at time of transplantation, but not recipient age or the intensity of the conditioning regimens, was the most important factor influencing outcomes </plain></SENT>
