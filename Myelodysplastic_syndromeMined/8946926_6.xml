<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients are women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although widely varying 5q segments are deleted, the vast majority of cases share a common deleted region (5q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether or not other deleted 5q regions are of clinical importance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to throw light on this question, 439 published 5q- cases were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The female preponderance was found to be limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with 5q- as the only chromosome aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When other chromosome aberrations had developed or the diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, only marginal female preponderance was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5q31 was deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 5q- as the only aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and following cytogenetic progression other bands were deleted more often than 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference, together with a different female preponderance suggests diverse pathogenetic mechanisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the bands 5q13-5q21 were found to be of importance for clinical progression from RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and 5q22-5q33 of importance for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and cytogenetic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the 5q bands deleted affect both clinical and cytogenetic progression </plain></SENT>
