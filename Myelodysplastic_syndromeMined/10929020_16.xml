<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore explored a less intensive conditioning in 33 patients with a median age of 52 years (range 43-60) transplanted from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (n = 7) or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (n = 5); 15 patients (45%) had advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen consisted of thiotepa (THIO; 10 mg/kg) on day -5 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY; 50 mg/kg) on days -3 and -2 (total dose 100 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The source was bone marrow (BM) (n = 17) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) (n = 16), which were infused without manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) and a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean time to achieve a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 109/l was 17 d (range 11-23) and full donor chimaerism was detected in 79% of patients by day 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade III or IV occurred in 3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 45% of patients, with a significant difference for PB (69%) compared with BM transplants (23%) (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For BM grafts, the actuarial 2-year TRM was 6%, the relapse 56% and survival 87%; for PB grafts, these figures were, respectively, 27%, 33% and 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients are alive at a median follow-up of 762 d (range 216-1615) and 20 patients (60%) remain free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (39%) received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) either for persisting or relapsing disease and six patients had complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: (i) patients up to the age of 60 years can be allografted with reduced intensity conditioning; (ii) the procedure was associated with a low transplant-related mortality, particularly for bone marrow grafts, because of a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD; and (iii) DLI were required after transplant in half the patients for persisting disease or relapse </plain></SENT>
