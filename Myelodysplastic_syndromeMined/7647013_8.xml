<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a study in which we used a recently described method combining fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunophenotyping, i.e. FICTION, to assess the involvement of different cell lineages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (+8) or loss of Y chromosome (-Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood or marrow smears or cytocentrifuge preparations were stained both by antibodies to granulocytes (CD15), monocytes (CD14), T lymphocytes (CD3), B lymphocytes (CD20) and by probes specific for chromosomes 7, 8 or Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with -7, four with +8 and two with -Y studied, none showed lymphocytic involvement by the chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, -7, +8 and -Y were found in granulocytes and monocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied, but they involved a variable proportion of those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The partial involvement by -7 and +8 seen in some cases suggests that myelopo√Øesis was only partially clonal in those cases, or that the chromosome abnormality was a secondary event in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FICTION therefore appears to be a simple and easily reproducible method that can be used for the assessment of lineage involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
