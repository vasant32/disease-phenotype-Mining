<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomere length decreases with cell divisions and age, and at a crucial length it is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and cell senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that adds <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> to chromosomal ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most somatic cells lack telomerase activity yet haematopoietic stem cells retain low levels of telomerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some studies have found that chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation lead to the accelerated shortening of telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is routinely used in the mobilization of stem cells for transplantation, we evaluated its effects on telomerase activity and regulation, and on telomere dynamics, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of G-CSF increased telomerase activity in CD34+ haematopoietic cells compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In marrow-derived CD34+ cells, telomerase activity increased sevenfold, compared with a 14-fold increase in peripheral-blood-mobilized CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A parallel increase in the expression of human telomerase enzyme reverse transcriptase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein kinase C alpha occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, G-CSF administration to five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients after consecutive courses of CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) chemotherapy, resulted in telomere length preservation or elongation, as opposed to marked attrition in patients who did not receive growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the in vivo administration of G-CSF prevents or attenuates telomere attrition associated with chemotherapy administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This attenuation may contribute to the preservation of telomere integrity inG-CSF-primed transplanted stem cells </plain></SENT>
