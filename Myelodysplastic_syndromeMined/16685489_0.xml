<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They also serve as a model for a variety of diseases and possess exemplary relevance for basic research and patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> research and therapy have achieved high standards and even a leading position in Germany with regard to clinical trials, standardization of diagnostics and molecular studies of prognostic factors, signal transduction and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progress is hampered, however, by fragmentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> trial groups, diagnostic approaches and treatment research activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GOALS: A network was therefore created to integrate the leading <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> trial groups on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e>) and their interdisciplinary partners (diagnostics, treatment research, biometry) in cooperation with basic research and pharmaceutical industry to foster advancements in leukemiarelated research and health care through clinical trials, promotion of translational research, introduction of standards for diagnostics and therapy, and development of evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ACHIEVEMENTS: Achievements include establishment of central information, communication and management structures, creation of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> intergroup comprising five study groups, formation of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> study group and establishment of platforms for diagnostics, genomics and proteomics, and medical informatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exchange of scientific progress is mediated by intra- and internet, biannual newsletters, regular project group meetings, and annual network symposia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PERSPECTIVES: On the basis of experience with the Competence Network "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo>" with its management, communication and information structures, the "European LeukemiaNet" (ELN) has been established within the 6th Framework Program of the European Union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ELN integrates 78 leading <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> trial groups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, CLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e>), their 83 interdisciplinary partner groups (diagnostics, treatment research, registry, guidelines), industry and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMEs</z:e> (small- and medium-sized enterprises) across Europe to form a cooperative network for advancements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-related research and health care </plain></SENT>
