<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of accurate prognostic classification systems allows a risk-adapted treatment strategy in the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was considered until recently as the only curative approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that intensive chemotherapy programs, such as those employed for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, may lead to prolonged disease-free survival in a low but significant fraction of patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensive post-remission chemotherapy, with or without autologous HSCT, may constitute an appropriate alternative for those patients lacking a suitable sibling donor or for older patients who are in remission after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review we will summarise the results and future perspectives of intensive chemotherapy for high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
