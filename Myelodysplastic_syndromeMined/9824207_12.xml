<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically unrelated clones were observed in 13 patients: 11 patients with two unrelated clones, one patient with three unrelated clones, and one patient with four unrelated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases of unrelated clones presented as t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas only one case presented as overt t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete deletions of the long arms or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for chromosome 5 or chromosome 7, which are characteristic of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, were observed in both unrelated clones in four patients and in one unrelated clone only in six patients, whereas three patients showed aberrations in both clones that were uncharacteristic of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three different interpretations of the origin and significance of cytogenetically unrelated clones in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are presented, although the disease is still considered to be monoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, patients with different defects of the long arm of chromosome 5 or chromosome 7 in two unrelated clones often seem to have acquired these aberrations as independent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this reason, it is possible that they may play an important role in leukemic transformation, for instance, by activating or potentiating the effect of a genetic change that is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells but not disclosed as a visible chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with involvement of other chromosomes, unrelated clones sometimes develop by cytogenetic change in only a subclone of cells, indicating that they play a role only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, unrelated clones in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may represent two different monoclonal diseases: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This view is supported by the significant excess of unrelated clones observed in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (4 in 13 cases) compared with other diseases (9 in 167 cases; P = 0.02), and by results from a case with a balanced translocation that is highly characteristic of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one clone and a t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 in another </plain></SENT>
