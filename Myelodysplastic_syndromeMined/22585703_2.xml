<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (t-MN) represent a unique clinical syndrome occurring in patients treated with chemotherapy and/or external-beam radiation (XRT) and are characterized by poorer prognosis compared with de novo disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XRT techniques have evolved in recent years and are associated with significantly reduced bone marrow exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of post-XRT t-MN in the current era have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) after XRT alone (47 patients) or cytotoxic chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy (C/CMT, 181 patients) and compared them with patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (222 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated bone marrow exposure to radiation and compared the clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic features and outcome of the XRT patients with the C/CMT patients and with patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with t-MN after XRT alone had superior overall survival (P = .006) and lower incidence of high-risk karyotypes (P = .01 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and &lt; .001 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) compared with patients in the C/CMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no significant differences in survival or frequency of high-risk karyotypes between the XRT and de novo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed in the past decade in patients after receiving XRT alone differ from t-MN occurring after C/CMT and share genetic features and clinical behavior with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that post-XRT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may not represent a direct consequence of radiation toxicity and warrant a therapeutic approach similar to de novo disease </plain></SENT>
