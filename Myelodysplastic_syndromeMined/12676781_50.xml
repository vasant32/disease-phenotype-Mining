<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is standard therapy before transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical trial reported here was undertaken to test the hypothesis that fludarabine can replace <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in this regimen and facilitate donor engraftment with reduced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of 30 mg/m2 intravenous fludarabine daily from day -9 to day -6, and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> given at 1 mg/kg 4 times a day every 6 hours from day -5 to day -2, with doses adjusted to target plasma levels of 900 +/- 100 ng/mL at steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were used for prophylaxis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enrolled were 42 patients with high-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n = 4) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 52 years (range, 12-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mobilized blood stem cells were obtained from HLA-compatible siblings (n = 16) or unrelated donors (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the day-100 regimen-related mortality was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 13-27 months), the probabilities of overall survival, disease-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality were 42.4%, 34.9%, and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the combination of fludarabine and targeted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> is sufficiently immunosuppressive to facilitate engraftment of blood stem cells from HLA-matched siblings and unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these encouraging results, further studies of fludarabine and targeted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> are warranted in standard-risk patients </plain></SENT>
