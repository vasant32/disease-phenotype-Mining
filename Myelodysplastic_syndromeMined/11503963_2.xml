<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of this molecule on the leukocytes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) in an effort to detect acquired deficiencies of this molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used immunofluorescence flow cytometry in analyzing whole blood and isolated neutrophils from 49 MDS patients, 33 men and 16 women aged 33 to 85 years (median, 75 years), and 18 healthy individuals aged 35 to 80 years (median, 72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to French-American-British classification criteria, 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 18 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, 9 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, 4 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and 5 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found decreased expression of CD43 on the neutrophils of these patients, and we correlated this finding with the activation status of these cells as it is defined by their phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD67, CD69, CD44, and CD53 molecules known to be changed in the activated form of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD43 expression correlated positively with CD53 and CD44 expression and negatively with CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD67, and CD69 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, increased levels of soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were detected in these patients, suggesting endothelial cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we believe that the decreased expression of CD43 on the neutrophils of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is associated with activation of these cells and is probably due to cleavage of the molecule from the cell surface and that the same mechanism is possibly responsible for the parallel down-regulation of CD44 and CD53 </plain></SENT>
