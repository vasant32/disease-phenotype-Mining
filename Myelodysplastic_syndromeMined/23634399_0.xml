<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: The present study was undertaken to calculate the prevalence of various conditions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and to record the megakaryocytic alterations in various cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from this by means of statistical analysis it was tried to analyze whether a significant difference existed in megakaryocytic alteration noted in myelodysplastic versus non- myelodysplastic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: A prospective series of 60 bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> along with concomitant bone marrow biopsies was conducted in a tertiary care centre catering to both urban as well as rural population in north India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical Analysis: The distribution of morphological changes in cases of non myelodysplastic conditions and myelodysplastic were compared using Chi-Square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: The commonest cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> for which bone marrow examination was sought was dimorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (18 cases, 30%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (06 cases, 10%) which was followed equally by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> conditions apart from dimorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>); megakaryocytic dysplastic forms were not noted in any other condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>; dysplastic forms, bare megakaryocytic nuclei, hypogranular forms and micromegakaryocytes were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison between frequencies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, high and low number of nuclear lobes among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=9) and non <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=68) conditions were found to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Further studies on the evaluation of megakaryocytic alteration and their contribution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> can provide growing knowledge to the pathogenesis of numerous hematopoietic disorders that may identify broader clinical applications of the newer strategies to regulate platelet count and functioning </plain></SENT>
