<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the biological and immunoregulatory effect of the treatment with the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha monoclonal antibody cA2 on bone marrow (BM) progenitor/precursor and stromal cells and lymphocyte subsets, as well as the clinical response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ten low-intermediate risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients received i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cA2 (3 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number, survival, and clonogenic potential of BM progenitor/precursor cells, the hematopoiesis-supporting capacity of BM stromal cells, and the lymphocyte activation status were investigated in the patients at baseline and following treatment using flow cytometry, clonogenic assays, and long-term BM cultures (LTBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was evaluated according to standardized criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cA2 administration reduced the proportion of apoptotic and Fas+ cells in the CD34+ cell compartment (P = 0.0215 and P = 0.0344, respectively) and increased the clonogenic potential of BM mononuclear and CD34+ cells (P = 0.0399 and P = 0.0304, respectively) compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibody reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha levels in LTBMC supernatants (P = 0.0043) and significantly improved the hematopoiesis-supporting capacity of LTBMC adherent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of activated peripheral blood and BM T-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytes decreased</z:e> significantly after treatment, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect of cA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients displayed minor hematologic responses whereas the remaining patients displayed stable disease with no disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The encouraging biological insights from cA2 administration may be useful in conducting further clinical trials using cA2 for selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, particularly those with evidence of immune-mediated inhibition of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
