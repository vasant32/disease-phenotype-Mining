<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is high, and patients are likely to require hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationships between these events and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1864 patients registered in the United States' Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and aged â‰¥ 66 years old when diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 2001 or 2002 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medicare claims were used to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> complications and utilization (hospitalizations, ED visits, and transfusions) until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the end of 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality was based on SEER data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier incidence rates were estimated and multivariable Cox models were used to study the association between complications and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was 81%, 25%, and 41%, and the incidence of hospitalization, ED visit, and transfusion was 62%, 42%, and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival time was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytopenia complications were significantly associated with each of these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of cytopenia are common among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and are risk factors for high rates of health care utilization and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Management of the complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may improve patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
