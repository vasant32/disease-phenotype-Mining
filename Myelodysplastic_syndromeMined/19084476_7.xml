<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The available alternatives to an effective but technically complex Cox maze procedure for surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> include ablation using radiofrequency, microwave, laser, cryotherapy or ultrasound energy sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of high-intensity focused ultrasound cardiac ablation for the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 14 patients underwent epicardial high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> using the Epicor cardiac ablation system between August 2006 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed on the beating heart prior to the commencement of cardiopulmonary bypass for concomitant cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical examination, electrocardiography and 24-h Holter monitoring were used to determine the postoperative heart rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly related to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> died of septic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients required cardioversion at 1 day, 3- and 4-month intervals postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently 10/13 (77%) patients are in sinus rhythm, one patient required insertion of a permanent pacemaker, one patient is in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and another patient is in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Epicardial high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation is a viable alternative to the Cox maze procedure for the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is a safe and efficient procedure that does not require cardiopulmonary bypass and may potentially be performed using less invasive surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
