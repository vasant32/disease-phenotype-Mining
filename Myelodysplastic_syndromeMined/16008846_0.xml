<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 173 patients diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to FAB or WHO criteria with complete clinical and cytogenetical data were included in this research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them 42 had +8 chromosome aberration, 16 had -7/7q-, and 55 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and more than 0.10 blast cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short term culture and G-banding techniques and in some specimens fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method were used to do chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the detected chromosome aberrations, +8 was the most frequent (42.8%) and then -7/7q-(15.0%); 42 patients with +8 had median blast cell count of 0.08, within a median of 18 months follow-up period 40.0% of the patients evolved to frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (FL) and the median overall survival was 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>16 patients with -7/7q- had higher blast cell count of 0.135; 43.8% of them developed into FL and the median overall survival was only 10 months within a 20-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>55 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype but a median blast cell count of 0.148; 52.7% of them patients evolved to FL and the median overall survival was 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the +8 and -7/7q- groups have malignant leukemic cell clone, and run a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and progressive clinical course; it is suggested they might be classified into Sub-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We should keep close watch on the patients who have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype yet more than 0.10 blast cells, part of whom might suffer from early Sub-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
