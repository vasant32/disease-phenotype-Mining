<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency and distribution of de novo somatic structural variants in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells is, however, poorly explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using age-stratified cohorts of 318 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 296 single-born subjects, we describe age-related accumulation of copy-number variation in the nuclear genomes in vivo and frequency changes for both megabase- and kilobase-range variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Megabase-range aberrations were found in 3.4% (9 of 264) of subjects ≥60 years old; these subjects included 78 MZ twin pairs and 108 single-born individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No such findings were observed in 81 MZ pairs or 180 single-born subjects who were ≤55 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent region- and gene-specific mutations, mostly deletions, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal analyses of 43 subjects whose data were collected 7-19 years apart suggest considerable variation in the rate of accumulation of clones carrying structural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the longitudinal analysis of individuals with structural aberrations suggests that there is a natural self-removal of aberrant cell clones from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three healthy subjects, we detected somatic aberrations characteristic of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recurrent rearrangements uncovered here are candidates for common age-related defects in human blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that extension of these results will allow determination of the genetic age of different somatic-cell lineages and estimation of possible individual differences between genetic and chronological age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our work might also help to explain the cause of an age-related reduction in the number of cell clones in the blood; such a reduction is one of the hallmarks of immunosenescence </plain></SENT>
