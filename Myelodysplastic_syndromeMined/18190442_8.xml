<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The histologic diagnosis of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cutis (LC) can be difficult, requiring confirmatory immunohistochemical stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reviewed 21 biopsy-proven cases of LC with emphasis on the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and histologic features were reviewed on 21 cases of biopsy proven LC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stains for CD4, CD34, CD56, CD68, CD117, CD123, TdT, lysozyme and myeloperoxidase were performed on 12 with available tissue blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ages ranged from 24 to 88 years (mean = 57), with 12 men: 9 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary hematologic diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (n = 1) and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, NOS (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monocytic myeloid LC was most common (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was 100% positivity with CD68 and lysozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase, CD117 and CD34 immunostains were less sensitive in myeloid LC (58%, 33% and 17%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD4 was positive in 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD56 was positive in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with monocytic differentiation more commonly involves the skin than other types of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD68 and lysozyme immunostains, although not lineage specific for monocytes/macrophages, are the most sensitive immunostains in the detection of myeloid LC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase immunostains are useful, but immunostains for CD117 and CD34 are insufficiently sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD4 expression is common, but CD56 expression is not </plain></SENT>
