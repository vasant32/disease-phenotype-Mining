<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 females and 7 males, with a median age of 45 years, were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 6-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS) for Less Advanced (Low and Intermediate-1 risk IPSS) and Advanced (Intermediate-2 and High risk IPSS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 71.4% and 43.6%, respectively (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not observe a difference in EFS depending on cytogenetics at diagnosis (good risk 53.8% Vs intermediate and high risk 53.3%, p=ns), neither on the type of conditioning regimen used (myeloablative 50% Vs reduced intensity 52.2%, p=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results support that IPSS score at diagnosis may be used to predict EFS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> undergoing allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
