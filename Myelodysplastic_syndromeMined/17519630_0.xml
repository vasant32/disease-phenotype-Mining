<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pelgeroid cells have round, oval, or hyposegmented nuclei and are therefore difficult to recognize as neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pPH anomaly is important because it is found mostly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients are also at risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cutis, the main differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our case, the proper diagnosis was made with the help of immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
