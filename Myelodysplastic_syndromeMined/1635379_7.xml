<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> have been shown to be due to the enhanced colony-stimulating activity (CSA) and responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been related to increased CSA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the serum (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels by a sandwich linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) in patients with ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at presentation and following high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (HDMP) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum GM-CSF levels at presentation in the ten cases studied ranged between 160 and 700 pg/ml (mean 418.5 +/- 252.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week following HDMP therapy GM-CSF levels increased to between 260 and 950 pg/ml (733.5 +/- 203.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after therapy the GM-CSF levels increased to between 470 and 1350 pg/ml (911 +/- 278.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF levels were markedly elevated one week after HDMP in the patients with ALL, suggesting that in addition to the lymphotoxic effects on leukemic blasts, the acceleration in neutrophil recovery may be due to release of GM-CSF induced by HDMP and its effects on myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
