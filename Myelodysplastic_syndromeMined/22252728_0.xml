<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) exhibit bone marrow hypercellularity, a subset of them present with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific factors associated with poor prognosis have not been investigated in patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied a cohort of 253 patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed at The University of Texas MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center between 1993 and 2007 and a cohort of 1725 patients with hyper-/normocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed during the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presented more frequently with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P &lt; .019), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001), low serum β-2 microglobulin (P &lt; .001), increased transfusion dependency (P &lt; .001), and intermediate-2/high-risk disease (57% vs 42%, P = .02) compared with patients with hyper-/normocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no difference in overall survival was observed between the 2 groups (P = .28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group ≥2), low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (&lt;10 g/dL), unfavorable cytogenetics (-7/7q or complex), increased bone marrow blasts (≥5%), and high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (&gt;600 IU/L) as adverse independent factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A new prognostic model based on these factors was built that segregated patients into 3 distinct risk categories independent of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This model is independent from the IPSS, further refines IPSS-based prognostication, and may be used to develop of risk-adapted therapeutic approaches for patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
