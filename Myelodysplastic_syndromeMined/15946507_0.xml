<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow cell chromosome preparations were made with both direct method and short-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was performed by R-banding technique, and dual-color FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) by using a 20q telomeric probe and a sequence-specific probe for 20q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical and hematological findings were comparable with diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>Karyotype analysis showed that both patients had double isochromosome 20q- anomaly: case 1 is 46, XX, der(20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>i(20q-) [6]/46, idem, der (6) i (6p) [1]/47, idem, +der (20)? i (20q-) [3]/47, idem, der(6)i (6p), +der(20)? i (20q-) [20]; case 2 is 45, XY, -7, der (20)? i (20q-) [17]/46, idem, +der(20)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>i(20q-) [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two derivative chromosomes 20 were proved 20q isochromosomes with interstitial deletions by dual-color FISH in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Double isochromosome 20q- anomaly is a rare recurrent karyotype abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and signals a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
