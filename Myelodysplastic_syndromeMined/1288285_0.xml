<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis rests mainly on the subjective identification of qualitative abnormalities according to the French-American-British criteria (FAB) involving one or more bone marrow hematopoietic cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of nonrandom chromosome abnormalities remains the hallmark of the disease and the only means of investigation which confirms the disease objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the purpose in mind to further characterize RA among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we have undertaken a prospective high resolution banding chromosome analyses of bone marrow cells in patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (PRA) with the aim of defining a cytogenetic phenotype and of assessing the clinical relevance of clonal abnormalities at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 39 patients consecutively referred for chromosome analyses with a diagnosis of RA according to the FAB criteria, 27 patients had PRA and fulfilled our criteria for adequate chromosome analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 27 patients (52%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed a complex karyotype; 9/14 (64%) had a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interstitial or terminal deletions, involving chromosomes 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 20, were found in 11/14 (79%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of survival between patients with and without abnormalities showed no difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of clonal abnormalities did not predict transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) nor was it associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this study, patients with PRA were found to have a predominant pseudodiploid karyotypic pattern characterized by interstitial and/or terminal deletions as opposed to derivatives, specific and non-specific balanced translocations, or other structural and numerical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We were unable to reveal any prognostic significance to the presence of these clonal abnormalities at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
