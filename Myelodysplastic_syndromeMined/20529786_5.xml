<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ineffective hematopoiesis and clonal proliferation result in significant cytopenias in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients are categorized into risk groups (i.e., low, intermediate [1 and 2], and high) based on severity of cytopenias, cytogenetic abnormalities, and the presence of bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only potentially curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which often is not an option because of advanced age at diagnosis (median age = 76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several alternative treatments to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation show great promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For low- and intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the novel antitumor immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide is approved for patients with del(5q), and two different hypomethylating agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, are approved for intermediate-2- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trial results have increased the understanding of these treatments, alone or in combination with other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effective treatment often requires at least three to six months to achieve a clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the meantime, or in addition to active therapy, supportive care has a positive effect on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater understanding of the factors affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treatment options will assist <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> nurses in facilitating the optimal combination of treatment, supportive care, and management of adverse events </plain></SENT>
