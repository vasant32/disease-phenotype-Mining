<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD(3)(+) T cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell-sorting system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TET2 and DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in bone marrow CD(3)(+) T cells from 26 MDS patients and 16 healthy controls were detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of TET2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in CD(3)(+) T cells was down-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by (0.16 ± 0.15) fold compared with the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of TET2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in CD(3)(+) T cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was positively correlated with serum complement C(3) (r = 0.404, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in CD(3)(+) T cells was up-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by (1.61 ± 0.88) folds compared with the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grouped by the chromosomes, the patients with chromosome abnormalities presented significantly higher DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes [(1.45 ± 0.44) folds, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in CD(3)(+) T cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was positively correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.343, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TET2 in CD(3)(+) T cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was decreased while the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of DLK1 was increased, which might decline the immune surveillance function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings would be useful for exploring the mechanism of immune tolerance </plain></SENT>
