<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blast cells was clearly promoted by these CSFs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases examined, but considerable percentages of them often remained immature compared with the favorable maturation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast cells, especially in the more advanced disease groups (LT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) that included two prominent cases with a remarkable blast cell growth without maturation induction by CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of esterase activities was rather sluggish in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, in contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blast cells proliferate in response to CSFs but that maturation is less than that observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Much care should be taken with in vivo application of CSFs to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
