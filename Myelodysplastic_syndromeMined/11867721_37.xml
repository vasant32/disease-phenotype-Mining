<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although DNA breakpoints in AML1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> (at 8q22) cluster in a few introns, the mechanisms of DNA recombination resulting in t(8;21) are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation of specific chromatin structural elements, i.e., topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and scaffold-associated regions, which have been implicated in chromosome recombination with genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> in t(8;21) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints in AML1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> were clustered in the Kasumi 1 cell line and in 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients with t(8;21); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one had de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten in vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites were mapped in AML1, including three in intron 5 and seven in intron 7a, and two were in intron 1b of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
