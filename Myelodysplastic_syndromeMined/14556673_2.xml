<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is clear now that their mechanism of action is more complex and probably involves other proteins unrelated to Ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least 3 drugs within this family have been investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra), lonafarnib (SCH66336, Sarasar), and BMS-214662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 2 are administered orally, whereas BMS-214662 is given intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These drugs are at different stages of development, and design of treatment schedules and methodology of the available studies are very different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most of the information is still preliminary, these agents have demonstrated clear evidence of clinical activity in these diseases and very favorable toxicity profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several studies are still ongoing to better define the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, as well as to determine the best schedules, the role of combination with other agents, and the role of these agents in different settings, such as the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is very possible that these agents will soon find their way to the ranks of established agents for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
