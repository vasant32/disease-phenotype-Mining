<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MCVAC regimen (consisting of ranimustine (MCNU), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and CY) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for patients with high-risk or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> who received the MCVAC regimen followed by autologous PBSCT were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up duration of the surviving patients was 51.2 months (range, 5.4-151.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5-year OS and PFS were 73.7% (95% confidence interval (CI), 58.6-88.8) and 62.5% (95% CI, 46.8-78.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although relapse remained the most frequent cause of treatment failure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> adverse events were observed, including two cases of severe pulmonary impairment, and two cases of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the MCVAC regimen would be an effective and tolerable conditioning regimen without TBI for autologous PBSCT for high-risk or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> pulmonary toxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> should be monitored </plain></SENT>
