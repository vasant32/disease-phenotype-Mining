<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For understanding of these diseases, the evaluation of the chimeric status of LC following BMT is of great interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the sex chromosome constitution of LC in the skin, we established a modified and refined technique of combined immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and investigated frozen sections of skin biopsies from nine patients after allogeneic sex-mismatched BMT and of two healthy donors for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LC were specifically labeled using a fluorescent CD1 a antibody and hybridized simultaneously with X and Y chromosome-specific DNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this practical application on nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients show the appearance of donor-type LC and the persistence of host-type LC at various times (36 up to 1395 days) after sex-mismatched BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete chimerism of LC could not be detected in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of recipient-specific LC ranged from 7% to 92% and showed no correlation with time postgrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude from our results of 1461 analyzed LC that combined immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetic analysis by FISH is the method of choice for the assessment of chimerism in a particular cell type after sex-mismatched BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its practical application on other tissues affected by BMT-related pathophysiological processes reveals further knowledge of the time-dependent course of chimeric patterns after BMT </plain></SENT>
