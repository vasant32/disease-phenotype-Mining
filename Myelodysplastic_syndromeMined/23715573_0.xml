<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes changes in use, technique, and survival in a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODSThe study included 38,060 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> or disorders who underwent first alloHCT in a US or Canadian center from 1994 to 2005 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research.ResultsAlloHCT as treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> increased by 45%, from 2,520 to 3,668 patients annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1994 to 2005, use of both peripheral (7% to 65%) and cord blood increased (2% to 10%), whereas use of marrow decreased (90% to 27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite a median age increase from 33 to 40 years and 263% increase in unrelated donors for alloHCT, overall survival (OS) at day 100 significantly improved for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first complete remission after myeloablative sibling alloHCT (85% to 94%; P &lt; .001) and unrelated alloHCT (63% to 86%; P &lt; .001); 1-year OS improved among those undergoing unrelated alloHCT (48% to 63%; P = .003) but not among those undergoing sibling alloHCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen for ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Day-100 OS after cord blood alloHCT improved significantly from 60% to 78% (P &lt; .001) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of reduced-intensity regimens increased, yielding OS rates similar to those of myeloablative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONSurvival for those undergoing alloHCT has significantly improved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, new approaches are needed to further improve 1-year OS </plain></SENT>
