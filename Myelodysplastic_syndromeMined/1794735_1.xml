<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ANLL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) secondary to treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some cases the simultaneous appearance of MM and ANLL has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this series the simultaneous appearance of MM and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathies</z:hpo> in 91 untreated patients with MM, and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathies</z:hpo> during the course of the disease in 72 treated patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simultaneous appearance of MM (IgA/lambda) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) was observed in one case (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathies</z:hpo> in treated patients with MM was found in 4 out of 72 cases (cumulative risk at 8 years 28.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case (IgG/lambda MM) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) developed 6 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second patient (IgG/k MM) a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> was observed 5 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was 46, XX, -5 + t (20;?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The third patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lambda light chain disease</z:e> developed <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> 11 months after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was 46, XY/hypodiploidy + M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the fourth case (IgG/k MM) developed ANLL (M4) 28 months after the initial diagnosis and the karyotype was 45, XX, -7, t(1;3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous appearance of MM and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathies</z:hpo> is unusual and probably represents a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of a single progenitor in both lymphoid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathies</z:hpo> during the course of treated patients is a common phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The time of development and the cytogenetic findings strongly suggest that they are related to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
