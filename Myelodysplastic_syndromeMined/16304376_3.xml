<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimum timing, however, and the best conditioning strategy have remained controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both conventional and reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative regimens have been used successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among selected patients with less advanced/low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (&lt; 5% marrow myeloblasts), 3-year survivals of 65% to 75% are achievable with HLA-matched related and unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with more advanced/ high-risk disease (&gt; or = 5% marrow blasts; high International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] scores), the probability of post-transplant relapse ranges from 10% to 40%, and, as a result, relapse-free survival is inferior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to disease stage, co-morbid conditions, pre-transplant chemotherapy, conditioning regimen, source of stem cells, and post-transplant immunosuppression affect transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are associated with a decrease in non-relapse mortality and allow for successful hemopoietic stem cell transplants even in patients 60-70 years of age </plain></SENT>
