<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, we have now studied in iron-loaded rats the hepatic effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate given in a dose of 1.2 mg/100 g intraperitoneally twice a week for a period of 4.5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> injections caused a very marked increase in the mean hepatic iron content of the iron-loaded rats, which was more than twice the total amount of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-iron injected per rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> treatment did not significantly affect the activities of the enzymes involved in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no clinical side effects have been found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate so far, the present study suggests that in iron-load the possible adverse hepatic effects should be taken into account and a minimum therapeutic dose of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate should be used </plain></SENT>
