<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD158a expression was low and there was little change in the expression after allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, there was no difference in the proportion of CD158a+/CD3- after allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the proportion of CD158b+/CD3- cells, mainly NK cells, increased in the early stage (&lt; 2 months) after allo-BMT and then gradually decreased (3.3 +/- 2.6% before BMT vs. 15.4 +/- 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>6% in the early stage after BMT, 8.5 +/- 4.9% during the period 3-6 months after BMT and 7.0 +/- 3.0% &gt; 6 months after BMT; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, CD158b expression on CD3+ T cells increased 3 months after allo-BMT (1.1 +/- 1.1% before BMT vs. 5.1 +/- 7.7% during the period 3-6 months after BMT and 3.0 +/- 2.4% &gt; 6 months after BMT, P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest percentages of CD158 expression in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) and those with cGVHD were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD158b+/CD3+ cells and also that of CD158b+/CD8+ cells were significantly increased in patients with cGVHD compared with those in patients without cGVHD (2.6 +/- 2.0% vs. 8.0 +/- 11.2% and 2.3 +/- 1.5% vs. 8.3 +/- 11.7% respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The exact clinical relevance of these CD158b-expressing cells is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there is an interesting possibility that CD158b-expressing cells play some role in the regulation of GVHD after allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
