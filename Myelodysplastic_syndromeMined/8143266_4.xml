<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very recently, another case was reported of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with isolated tetrasomy 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report tetrasomy 8 in four cases of ANLL, two of them with M5 and one with M1 subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although in the latter case, tetrasomy 8 was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> karyotypes analyzed, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases it constituted a subpopulation of cells other than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (in only one case another change was evident in the karyotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the proportion of tetrasomic cells was determined in interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By this technique, small cell populations (3-9%) were detected in three additional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional "control" group of five <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> cases did not show a significant population of tetrasomic interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data show that tetrasomy 8, if present as a sole anomaly in ANLL, may play a rather specific role for the subtype, and probably for the progression of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as well </plain></SENT>
