<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The most recent and powerful prognostic instrument established for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which is primarily based on medullary blast cell count, number of cytopenias, and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this prognostic system has substantial predictive power in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, further refinement is necessary, especially as far as lower-risk patients are concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic parameters, which have long proved to be associated with outcome, are promising candidates to improve the prognostic accuracy of the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the additional predictive power of the presence of abnormally localized immature precursors (ALIPs) and CD34 immunoreactivity in bone marrow (BM) biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic, morphologic, and clinical data of 184 MDS patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from a single institution, were collected, with special emphasis on the determinants of the IPSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BM biopsies of 173 patients were analyzed for the presence of ALIP, and CD34 immunoreactivity was assessable in 119 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients received intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of ALIP and CD34 immunoreactivity significantly improved the prognostic value of the IPSS, with respect to overall as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival, in particular within the lower-risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the IPSS, both histologic parameters also were predictive of outcome within the group of intensively treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the importance of histopathologic evaluation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and indicate that determining the presence of ALIP and an increase in CD34 immunostaining in addition to the IPSS score could lead to an improved prognostic subcategorization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
