<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the clinical significance of N-ras mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) archival bone marrow samples from 252 patients were studied for the presence of N-ras exon I mutations using polymerase chain reaction amplification and differential oligonucleotide hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, clinical information about these patients was obtained and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 220 evaluable patients, 20 (9%) had point mutation of N-ras involving codon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals with N-ras mutation had a significantly shorter survival period than those who were N-ras negative (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was also found in patients with N-ras mutations (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>N-ras mutations were not associated with any French-American-British (FAB) subtype, with the presence of increased myeloblasts, or with chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of increased bone marrow blasts was strongly associated with poor survival rate and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P &lt; .001 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After stratifying for the percentage of blasts, N-ras mutations remained significantly associated with shorter survival period (P = .04) and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly when multiple abnormalities were present, were significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, N-ras mutation, although relatively infrequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, is associated with short survival period and increased probability of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
