<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of an 87-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At presentation, the patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype showed a clone with 3 to &gt;20 double minutes (dmin) that were MYC-positive and, in addition, a cryptic deletion of MYC on one of the chromosome 8 homologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dmin varied both in size and in fluorescence intensity for the MYC probe following FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After six months, the disease had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding karyotype showed a second cell line with two markers that appeared like rings and, again, a cryptic MYC deletion on one of the chromosome 8 homologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The markers contained centromeres and amplified MYC sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deletion of MYC on one of the chromosome 8 homologs and the variable sizes and intensities of the dmin supports an episome model for dmin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chronologically, the MYC-positive dmin appeared first, followed by the appearance of MYC-positive marker chromosomes, suggesting that the dmin may have evolved to form homogeneously staining regions (hsr) in vivo </plain></SENT>
