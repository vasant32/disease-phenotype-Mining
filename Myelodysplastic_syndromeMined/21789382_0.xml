<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of genetic alterations is closely associated with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of mutations in the points most frequent for mutations (hotspot mutations) in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and nucleophosmin (NPM1), which are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, in a population of Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to French-American-British classification, the patients were distributed as follows: 31 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples were obtained and screened for the presence of hotspot mutations using analysis based on amplification with the polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, fragment size polymorphisms or restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were screened for mutations at the time of diagnosis, and 5 patients were also screened at the time of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These results show that hotspot mutations in the PI3K, JAK2, FLT3 and NPM1 genes are not common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; nevertheless, JAK2 mutations may be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that hotspot mutations in the PI3K, JAK2, FLT3 and NPM1 genes are not common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; nevertheless, JAK2 mutations may be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> during disease progression </plain></SENT>
