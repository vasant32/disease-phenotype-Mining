<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation of MUTZ-1 cells induced by AS(2)O(3) solution of different concentrations were studied with cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, DNA fragmentation assay, RT-PCR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">Nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) reduction method and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: (1) Low concentration ofAS(2)O(3) (0.05 - 0.25 micromol/L) had no marked growth inhibition effect on MUTZ-1 cells; after 14 d treatment, it down-regulated the expression of positive cell differentiation antigens CD38, CD7, CD10, HLA-DR (P&lt;0.05), but did not up-regulate the expression of CD11b (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) After treatment with 1.0 - 20.0 micromol/L of AS(2)O(3), MUTZ-1 cells presented typical features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with a dose dependent manner (r=-0.999, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of bcl-2 mRNA and the ration of bcl-2/bax were decreased after AS(2)O(3) treatment (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low concentration of (2)O(3) may have partial differentiation inducement on MUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a certain range of dose (1.0 - 20.0 micromol/L), (2)O(3) can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2)O(3) can significantly down-regulate bcl-2 and it might be one of the mechanisms of (2)O(3) treatment </plain></SENT>
