<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors assessed the association between serum levels of various cytokines and clinical outcomes in patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, IL-6, IL-10, and endostatin were measured in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who presented for treatment at The University of Texas M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test for correlations with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher TNF-alpha levels were found to correlate with poorer performance status; higher leukocyte counts; higher levels of beta2-microglobulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and alkaline phosphatase; lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and albumin; baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; and M4-M5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha levels &lt;10 pg/mL were associated with higher rates of complete remission (P = .003), survival (P = .0003), and event-free survival (EFS) (P = .0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, on multivariate analyses, TNF-alpha level &gt; or =10 pg/mL was not found to be an independent factor predicting clinical outcomes, but became statistically significant when leukocyte count was excluded from the models </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High serum TNF-alpha level is an adverse prognostic factor for survival and EFS in patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
