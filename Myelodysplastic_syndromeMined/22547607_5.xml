<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had serum ferritin ≥ 1,000 μg/L and had received ≥ 20 units of RBCs with ongoing transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The starting dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was 20 mg/kg/d, with dose escalation up to 40 mg/kg/d permitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled, and 173 patients received therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median serum ferritin decreased 23% in the 53% of patients who completed 12 months of treatment (n = 91), 36.7% in patients who completed 2 years (n = 49), and 36.5% in patients who completed 3 years (n = 33) despite continued transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction in serum ferritin significantly correlated with ALT improvement (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Labile plasma iron (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e>) was measured quarterly during the first year of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients (39.3%) had elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By week 13, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> levels normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with abnormal baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one (28%) of 173 patients experienced hematologic improvement by International Working Group 2006 criteria; of these, only seven patients received growth factors or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the 3-year study, 138 (79.8%) of 173 patients discontinued therapy, 43 patients (24.8%) because of adverse events or disease progression and 23 patients (13.2%) because of abnormal laboratory values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased serum creatinine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, none of which were considered related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> reduces serum ferritin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> in transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients had an improvement in hematologic and hepatic parameters </plain></SENT>
