<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ARRY-520 selectively inhibits the mitotic kinesin spindle protein (KSP), which leads to abnormal monopolar spindle formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A phase 1 trial was conducted to establish the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ARRY-520 given as a 1-hour infusion in either a single dose or on a day 1, 3, and 5 divided-dose schedule per cycle in patients with advanced or refractory myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional objectives were to characterize pharmacokinetics, assess preliminary clinical activity, and explore biomarkers of KSP inhibition with ARRY-520 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 34) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 2) with a median age of 66 years (range, 21-88 years) were enrolled: 15 in the single-dose schedule (dose levels: 2.5, 3.75, 4.5, and 5.6 mg/m(2)) and 21 in the divided-dose schedule (dose levels: 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/m(2)/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MTD was 4.5 mg/m(2) total dose per cycle for both dose schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities included mucositis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">exfoliative rash</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grades 3 or 4 reversible drug-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> were observed in 33 of 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma pharmacokinetic analyses revealed low clearance of ARRY-520 (~3 L/hour), a volume of distribution of ~450 L, and a median terminal half-life of &gt;90 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monopolar spindles were observed in blood mononuclear cells, through use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi> nucleic acid stain and antitubulin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the relative lack of clinical activity, further development of ARRY-520 as an antileukemic agent was halted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00637052) </plain></SENT>
