<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from 115 patients were combined into three groups according to disease grade, i.e., low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (AL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data comparison showed that with the progression of disease grade, the immunophenotypes of CD34(+) myeloblasts were more immature, with an increase and a decrease in CD7 and CD15 expression, respectively, and the percentages of CD34(+) B-progenitors among total CD34(+) cells and the granularity of granulocytes decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that, in addition to myeloblast percentages, the expression of CD7 and B7-H1 on myeloblasts was independently associated with AL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
