<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date there are few antibodies available for the detection of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbF)-containing erythroblasts (F-blasts) in paraffin-embedded hematopoietic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we developed a new polyclonal antibody specific to F-blasts by immunization of a rabbit with synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of human HbF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specificity and reactivity of the antibody were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ELISA confirmed that the antibody showed strong immunoreactivity to fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> but no reaction to adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibody could detect the presence of fetal blood hemolysates (10 microg/mL) at a dilution of 10(-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to immunohistochemical analysis, there were strong positive reactions to fetal erythroblasts in the liver and the spleen at 29 weeks of gestation and to erythroblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> but no reactions to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult erythroblasts in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fetal erythrocytes in fetal blood vessels of placental tissues were strictly distinguished from maternal erythrocytes in the same sections by their positive reactions, indicating the presence of HbF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new antibody will be a useful tool for studying fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> synthesis and for detecting F-blasts in archival specimens of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
