<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the risk of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> doses greater than 2 g/m2 in patients with metastatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumors</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was retrospectively assessed in patients treated within clinical trials between January 1986 and February 1996 at four university centers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minimum patient follow-up was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) was calculated to estimate the risk associated with high cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> doses, as compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 302 patients with a median age of 29 years (range, 15 to 55) received a median cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> dose of 5 g/m2 (range, 2.4 to 14 g/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were observed, which resulted in a cumulative incidence of 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38% to 3.59%) at 52 months of median follow-up (range, 12 to 198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) developed in patients with primary mediastinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the observed four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which are most likely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-related, the risk for developing s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (SMR, 160 [95% CI, 43.7 to 411.2]) is significantly increased in comparison to the age-matched general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in the general population, the significantly elevated risk for developing s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> affects only 1.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> doses greater than 2 g/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HDCT, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> doses greater than 2 g/m2, is associated with an acceptably low incidence of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
