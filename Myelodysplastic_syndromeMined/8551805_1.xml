<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In exons 5 to 8, mobility shifts were detected in five of the 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis was subsequently performed, and four missense mutations (16.7%) and one silent nucleotide substitution were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients harbouring mutations were characterized as having advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> allele was observed in three of the four patients with missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mobility shifts of the N-ras or FMS gene were detected in these four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We next analysed the correlation of the p53 mutations with the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was accompanied by the progression in two of the three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that mutations of the p53 gene are associated with progression in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while being compatible with stable disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in others </plain></SENT>
