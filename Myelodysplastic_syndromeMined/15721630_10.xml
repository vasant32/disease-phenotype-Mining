<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a small portion of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, however, the disease may progress to advanced stages, frequently accompanied by cytogenetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> with the appearance of additional chromosomal aberrations besides the Philadelphia chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the appearance of an inv(11)(p15q22) as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patient undergoing treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells from the patient were found to express the fusion transcript of NUP98 and DDX10, which is in accordance with previously reported cases of de novo or therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with inv(11)(p15q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the patient showed resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> with the disease rapidly progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>, sequence analysis failed to reveal any mutation in the kinase domain of BCR/ABL that would explain the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of leukemic cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL, a target of the BCR/ABL kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations raise a possibility that the NUP98/DDX10 fusion might be involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> resistance as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
