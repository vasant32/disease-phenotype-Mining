<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, two genes, p16INK4A and p15INK4B (also called MTS1 and MTS2), have been localized in close proximity at the 9p21 locus, encoding cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitors of relative molecular mass 16 kD and 15 kD, respectively and also found to be deleted at a high frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes in 178 cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> including 81 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), seven of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), seven of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 43 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 27 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and 13 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by Southern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ALL cases showed a relatively high frequency of homozygous deletions (22%, 6 of 27) at the p16INK4A gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, of the six cases with p16INK4A homozygous deletions, only three showed homozygous deletions at the p15INK4B gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 81 CLL patients, we detected one homozygous and five heterozygous deletions at both the p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes and two heterozygous deletions at the p16INK4A gene alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of these two genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases is relatively low (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not detect deletions in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, HCL, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses of p16INK4A gene of six CLL cases with heterozygous deletion at this locus showed a 27-bp deletion at the splice acceptor site of intron 1 in one case and changes in the coding sequence in three other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data presented in this report showed that (1) p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes are preferentially deleted homozygously in ALL and heterozygously in CLL cases with frequent mutation in the second allele, and (2) p16INK4A gene appears to be more frequently deleted than p15INK4B gene </plain></SENT>
