<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study, involving nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts, the effects of treatment with recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) on hematopoietic function were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses of IL-3 ranging from 60 micrograms/m2 during weeks 1-6 to 125 micrograms/m2 during weeks 7-12 were administered as subcutaneous bolus injections three times per week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Platelet counts increased</z:e> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet increase correlated with stable or decreased serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, while an increase of TNF-alpha levels during IL-3 therapy occurred in patients with no change or a decrease of platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte counts increased in two patients and reticulocytes in three, without an effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis of the bone marrow revealed an expansion of the myeloid compartment in seven of eight evaluable patients, mainly due to stimulation of the precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No improvement of the in vitro growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential cytogenetic analyses indicate that IL-3 treatment does not act preferentially on either the cytogenetically abnormal or the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-term treatment with low-dose IL-3 stimulates megakaryopoiesis with increase of platelet counts, but that additional later-acting cytokines probably will be required to augment neutrophil and erythrocyte counts </plain></SENT>
