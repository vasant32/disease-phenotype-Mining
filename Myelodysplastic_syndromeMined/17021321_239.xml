<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether lenalidomide (CC5013) could reduce the transfusion requirement and suppress the abnormal 5q31- clone in patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-eight patients received 10 mg of lenalidomide for 21 days every 4 weeks or daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic, bone marrow, and cytogenetic changes were assessed after 24 weeks of treatment by an intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 148 patients, 112 had a reduced need for transfusions (76%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68 to 82) and 99 patients (67%; 95% CI, 59 to 74) no longer required transfusions, regardless of the karyotype complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to lenalidomide was rapid (median time to response, 4.6 weeks; range, 1 to 49) and sustained; the median duration of transfusion independence had not been reached after a median of 104 weeks of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration reached a median of 13.4 g per deciliter (range, 9.2 to 18.6), with a corresponding median rise of 5.4 g per deciliter (range, 1.1 to 11.4), as compared with the baseline nadir value before transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 85 patients who could be evaluated, 62 had cytogenetic improvement, and 38 of the 62 had a complete cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was complete resolution of cytologic abnormalities in 38 of 106 patients whose serial bone marrow samples could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (in 55% of patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (in 44%) were the most common reasons for interrupting treatment or adjusting the dose of lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide can reduce transfusion requirements and reverse cytologic and cytogenetic abnormalities in patients who have the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with the 5q31 deletion </plain></SENT>
