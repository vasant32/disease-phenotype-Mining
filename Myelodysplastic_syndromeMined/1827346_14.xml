<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral cytopenias are common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously successfully treated three such patients with improvement of some cytopenias with the impeded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm this finding and elucidate the mechanism of response, we treated an additional 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> (600-800 mg daily) for 3-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 22 evaluable patients taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> met our criteria for improvement of peripheral counts, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis, marrow culture studies and serial bone marrow biopsies revealed no alteration of the abnormal clone or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoiesis in patients on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggested that improvement in blood counts was not related to modulation of ineffective haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in these patients revealed that most patients presented with markedly elevated platelet associated IgG (PAIgG), elevated plasma platelet-bindable IgG (PBIgG), and an elevated number of monocyte Fc gamma receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> was associated with a decline in monocyte Fc gamma receptor number without significantly altering the elevated PAIgG or PBIgG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to our observations in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> may be due to enhanced peripheral blood cell destruction by abnormal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">Danazol</z:chebi> may modulate cytopenia by decreasing the number of monocyte Fc gamma receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">Danazol</z:chebi> treatment was associated with minimal toxicity, but clinically meaningful responses were rare </plain></SENT>
