<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA, telomeres shorten with cell division, a process thought to contribute to cell senescence and the proliferative crisis of transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reported telomere stabilization concomitant with detection of telomerase activity in cells immortalized in vitro and in <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp> cells, and suggested that telomerase is essential for unlimited cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now examined the temporal pattern of telomerase expression in selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that, unlike other somatic tissues, peripheral, cord blood, and bone marrow leukocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors expressed low levels of telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In leukocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) patients, activity was lower than in controls in early disease, and comparable with controls in late disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to bone marrow, telomerase activity was enhanced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and more significantly so in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of telomerase levels, telomeres shortened with progression of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that early CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells lack an efficient mechanism of telomere maintenance and that telomerase is activated late in the progression of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, presumably when critical telomere loss generates selective pressure for cell immortality </plain></SENT>
