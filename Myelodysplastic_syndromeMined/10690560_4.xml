<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor topotecan is active in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DX-8951f is a novel topo I inhibitor with more potent antitumor effects than topotecan or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the in vivo activity of DX-8951f, 6-week-old female <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice received injections into the tail vein with 2 x 10(7) exponentially growing KBM-3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each experiment, three to five sets of five mice were treated with DX-8951f doses ranging from 7.5 to 80 mg/kg and at schedules of 1, 3, and 5 days; a control set of five mice was treated with the drug vehicle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group received DX-8951f on day 7 of the inoculation with KBM-3 (early-treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the activity of DX-8951f in advanced disease, a second group was treated 1 month after the inoculation, when the animals were developing symptoms (late-treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study end point was the duration of survival until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which was assessed clinically and by the presence of the human DQ alpha gene in tissue samples by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six experiments were conducted with 170 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was higher in both the early- and late-treatment groups than in untreated controls, and the treated groups had significantly less central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significantly improved survival was observed in animals treated early with 60 and 80 mg/kg as a single injection, with 15 and 20 mg/kg over 3 days, and with 7.5 and 10 mg/kg over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the late-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> (treatment starting on days 28-35), improved survival was observed with a single dose of 80 or 20 mg/kg over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation was limited by dilution problems at the 1-day schedule and by toxicity (mainly gastrointestinal) of the prolonged schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both efficacy and toxicity were dose schedule dependent, increasing with higher doses and prolonged exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By establishing the antileukemic activity of DX-8951f against human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice at doses below the LD10, our data provide a rationale for clinical evaluation of the drug in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and favor the use of prolonged administration </plain></SENT>
