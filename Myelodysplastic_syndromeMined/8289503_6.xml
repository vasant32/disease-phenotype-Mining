<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simplified technique for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the prevalence of chromosomally abnormal clones in 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biotinylated centromeric probes for chromosomes 7, 8, 12 and X, as well as painting probes for chromosomes 7 and 11, were applied to air-dried bone marrow smears stored from 6 to 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the cases had been previously karyotyped, and five of these demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes which were confirmed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining four cases showed different chromosome changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> showed minor clones with either <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 12 (12% of cells) or tetraploidy (15% of cells) by FISH, whereas metaphase cytogenetics had demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 in 20% of cells, with no evidence of tetraploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another case which had been previously karyotyped was found to have a t(7;11) in 90% of cells while only 10% of cells were shown by FISH to contain this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was demonstrated by FISH in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), while <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was found in a case of RA with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), and in both of these cases the aneuploid clone was present in eosinophils as well as in erythroid and granulocytic precursors but not in lymphocytes or histiocytes, thereby demonstrating the value of FISH for identifying the affected cell lineage </plain></SENT>
