<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the results of a consecutive series of 90 refractory/relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 90 refractory/relapsed AL patients, 56 were male and 34 female, with a median age of 37 (13 - 59) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 73 patients suffered from AL including 11 Ph+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> in first complete remission, 23 in second or greater complete remission, 39 in non-remission or relapse and 17 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, of whom 27 received bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 30 peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and 33 BMT + PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent allo-HSCT with conditioning regimen of CY/TBI and 79 with BU/CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CsA + MTX regimen was use for prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 56/90 (62.2%) survived, 50/90 (55.5%) survived without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 28/90 (31.1%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated 4-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the 90 cases was 45.5% and 34.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 4-year OS and DFS were significantly higher for patients in CR (54.0%) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (70.1%) than in non-remission and relapsed (28.2%) patients before allo-HSCT (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome of grade 0-I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was better than that of II-IV GVHD (57.6% vs 26.7%, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, conditioning regimen and the source of stem cell were not the factors affecting OS, DFS, cumulative incidences of relapse rate and treatment related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the most significant factor associated with high DFS was the disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: allo-HSCT can cure a significant proportion of refractory/relapsed AL patients, especially for those in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early allo-HSCT is recommended for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
