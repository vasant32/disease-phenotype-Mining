<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed telomerase activity and hTERT expression in the bone marrow of ten control, 15 MDS patients and two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, likely evolved from a previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of c-myc, mad1, p53 (transcription factors involved in hTERT expression regulation), has been investigated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups, indicated that patients with more severe disease demonstrated significantly higher levels of hTERT expression and telomerase activity with respect to the patients with more favorable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>c-Myc and p53 expressions were not significantly different between controls and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, whereas mad1 expression was increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patiens, particularly in those with more favorable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that mad1 increase can contribute to reduce the hTERT expression in the early stage of disease and we suggest that hTERT expression and telomerase activity, whether confirmed in larger series of cases could support other parameters in the diagnosis and stadiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
