<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the cytogenetic characteristics of hematopoietic cells (HC) and bone marrow mesenchymal stoma cells (BMMSC) isolated from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and healthy individuals as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and to clarify whether HC and BMMSC are simultaneously involved and participate in pathogenesis and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both marrows of 22 newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 7 healthy individuals were collected; BMMSC were isolated and amplified by using established culture system, as well as were identified according to morphologic features and surface antigens detected by flow cytometry; the characteristics of BMMSC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed; the BMMSC karyotyping analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was performed by banding of HC and BMMSC with pancreatin-Giemsa technique (GTG) and in accordance with ISCN (2005) requirements; the cytogenetic characteristics of HC and BMMSC were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that in vitro culture system for isolation and amplification was successfully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The light microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that BMMSC possessed characteristics showing long and thin spindle form and expressing CD29, CD73, CD90 antigens, and unexpressing CD34, CD45 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BMMSC of 14 MDS patients (64%), the cytogenetic abnormalities were found usually involving the loss of chromosomal material (92%), among which clonal loss was observed in 7 cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection indicated a random loss of chromosomal material in significant proportion of BMMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of chromosomal material random loss may be a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> in BMMSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the detection also showed that completely consistent aberration types did not exist between HC and BMMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aberrations were observed in 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype of HC, its aberration rate (33%) was obviously lower than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with abnormal karyotypes (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the cytogenetic abnormalities exist in BMMSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the unbalanced aberration of chromosomal materials may be a genetic instability marker of BMMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference of aberration types in BMMSC from HC suggests that genetic susceptibility of BMMSC and HC is similar, but no completely identical, which indicates the potential involvement of BMMSC in pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studying this potential role of BMMSC can be helpful to further understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> biological characteristics and provide the new approaches for diagnosis and therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
