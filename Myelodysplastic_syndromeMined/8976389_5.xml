<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and two as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were secondary to a primary malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of eleven patients had a history of intensive polychemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for 3.5 to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean interval from initial therapy to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> was 13.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex chromosomal aberrations were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Band 3p21 was involved in translocations in 9 patients and in deletions in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A t(3;16)(p21;p13) was found in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional abnormalities frequently included a -5, -7, as well as deletions or rearrangements of these 2 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data reported in this paper suggest that 3p21 is a recurrent treatment-related breakpoint in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and is likely to contain a gene involved in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
