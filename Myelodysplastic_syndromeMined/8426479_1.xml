<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which amplifies the VNTR region at the Ha-ras locus and offers a number of advantages over conventional Southern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ha-ras VNTR genotypes were assigned to 57 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 49 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_338'>granulocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison with previous reports we found significantly higher frequencies of rare alleles (20.2%) in our <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects of whom more than 35% had at least one 'rare' allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of rare alleles in the patient groups was not significantly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (chi 2 = 0.54, p = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In studies of constitutional and leukaemic DNA from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, we found that allelic loss at the Ha-ras locus was not a common phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improved resolution achievable with PCR compared with Southern analysis was demonstrated by the inability of Southern analysis to resolve six out of 34 PCR heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that previous studies showing linkage between rare Ha-ras alleles and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> should be reevaluated using our sensitive PCR technique </plain></SENT>
