<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have conducted a Phase I/II study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 53 patients received 75 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> subcutaneously or intravenously once daily for seven consecutive days on a 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C(max) following intravenous administration was approximately 3.7-fold higher than that following subcutaneous administration, whereas the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity was comparable for subcutaneous and intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bioavailability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> following subcutaneous administration was 91.1%, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> is nearly completely absorbed after subcutaneous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematologic improvement and hematologic response rates were 54.9% (28/51) and 28.3% (15/53), respectively, and there were no differences between the two routes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated and clinically manageable in Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse events occurred in ≥ 20% of patients included hematologic toxicity, gastrointestinal events, and general disorders, such as malaise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 adverse events that occurred in ≥ 50% of patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> due to hematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The safety profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was generally similar for both routes of administration, with the exception of injection site reactions observed following subcutaneous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> can be expected to be a useful therapeutic agent in Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
