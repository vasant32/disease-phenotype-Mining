<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether this association includes Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A possible association between autoimmune comorbidity and French-American-British Classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndrome</z:hpo> (FAB) or karyotype was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on retrospective examination of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients included in this study were identified by a search in Fyns Amts Sygehusvaesens Patientregister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from 2001 to 2005 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The search resulted in inclusion of 64 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of their autoimmune status, patients were divided into two groups: One group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and autoimmune comorbidity and one group with only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared by non-parametric statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significantly increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to demonstrate an association between autoimmune comorbidity and age, sex, FAB- or karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study shows an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> among Danish patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> which is in accordance with the majority of previous studies on this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data suggests that treatment of autoimmune comorbidity may also improve some of the clinical and biochemical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
