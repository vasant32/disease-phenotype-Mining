<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic involvement of the myeloid and erythroid cell lineages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 has been shown before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid subpopulations have also been investigated but generally with negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combined technique of May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa (MGG) for cell cytology and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a chromosome 7 specific DNA probe was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, immunophenotype and genotype of the cells were simultaneously examined with alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunostaining and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was found in the blasts and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or in subpopulations of myeloid and erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T cells (CD3+, CD5+) did not appear to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B cells (CD19+, CD22+) showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution of FISH spots in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient however the loss of a chromosome 7 was found in approximately 70% of the cells positive for B cell markers including CD79a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that in some cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a disease arising in a progenitor cell with repopulative abilities restricted to myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In other cases, the pluripotent progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may show the capacities to differentiate into B lineage lymphoid cells, as well as suggesting that in those instances <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> represents a condition of more primitive transformed hematopoietic ancestor cells </plain></SENT>
