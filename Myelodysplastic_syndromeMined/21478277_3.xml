<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available regarding how aware <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are of their disease severity, prognosis, and treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This Internet-based survey assessed patient perceptions regarding these factors, determined differences between patients with higher- and lower-risk disease and between those receiving active treatment and supportive care, and assessed patient-reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 358 patients (median age, 65 years), the median time since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis was 3 years and time from initial hematologic abnormality detection was 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many patients (55%) did not know their International Prognostic Scoring System score, 42% were unaware of their blast percentage, and 28% were unaware of their cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were unlikely to recall having their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> described as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (7%), 37% felt their treatment would improve survival, and 16% felt treatment would be curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving active treatment were more likely to believe their therapy would prolong survival than those receiving supportive care (52% versus 31%; p &lt; .001) or be curative (23% versus 14%; p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher-risk disease were more likely to think their therapy would be curative than those with lower-risk disease (26% versus 11%; p = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reported poor physical or mental health on two to three times more days per month than population norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have a limited understanding of their disease characteristics, prognosis, and treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results may help improve physician-patient communication and identify factors to consider when making treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
