<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors experienced a case of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after a major ABO incompatible BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> which was successfully treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of Epo were confirmed by the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after withdrawal of Epo as well as the rapid reincrease in reticulocytes on readministration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient received a dose of Epo which was similar to the amount used for renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, however serum concentration of Epo after administration exceeded endogenous Epo levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epo may have a beneficial role in the treatment of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after BMT </plain></SENT>
