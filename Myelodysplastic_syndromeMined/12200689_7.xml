<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better define the incidence and significance of cryptic chromosome lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed in interphase cells and, when appropriate, in metaphase cells and in morphologically intact BM smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five adult de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (group A) and 27 elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (group B) were tested using probes detecting the following anomalies: -5, -7, +8, deletions of 5q31, 7q31, 12p13/ETV6, 17p13/p53, 20q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in more than 20 cells and tested negative for the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-associated fusion genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient in group A was found to carry occult chromosome anomalies, whereas 8/27 patients in group B (P &lt; 0.0001) showed 5q31 or 7q31 deletion (three cases each), a 17p13/p53deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (one case each) in 33-60% interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metaphase cells showed only one hybridization signal at 5q31 (three cases) and 7q31 (one case), whereas two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> signals at 7q31 and chromosome 8 centromeres were seen in two patients with 7q deletion and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of blast cells (76-94%) carried the chromosome anomaly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; erythroid involvement in a minority of cells was seen in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group B, the presence of occult chromosome anomalies was associated with exposure to myelotoxic agents in the workplace (5/8 cases vs 3/19, P = 0.026) and with a lower complete remission rate (0/6 patients vs 7/12, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We arrived at the following conclusions: (1) cryptic chromosome deletions in the order of a few hundred kb magnitude may be found in a fraction of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and not in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220615" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult AML</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype; (2) these chromosome lesions are usually represented by submicroscopic rearrangements; (3) they display a specific pattern of cell-lineage involvement arguing in favor of their role in the outgrowth of the leukemic blast cells; (4) they are associated with a history of exposure to myelotoxic agents in the workplace and, possibly, with resistance to induction treatment </plain></SENT>
