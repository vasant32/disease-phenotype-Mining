<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for circulating p53 antibodies in 83 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), by an ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of p53 mutations was made by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene and confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating antibodies to p53 were seen in three of the 83 (3.5%) patients analyzed, and a p53 point mutation was found in ten cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients with p53 antibodies had a p53 mutation, but the remaining case had no detectable mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other eight mutated cases had no detectable p53 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that serological analysis of p53 antibodies is rarely positive in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations seen in those disorders, but also to the immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> to which they are often associated </plain></SENT>
