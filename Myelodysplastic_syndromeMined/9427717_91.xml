<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The leukemogenic risk associated to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> in ET, on the other hand, is generally considered to be relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1970 and 1991, we diagnosed ET in 357 patients, who were monitored until 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One or several therapeutic agents had been administered to 326 patients, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) in 251 (as only treatment in 201), pipobroman in 43, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in 41, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> in 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 98 months, 17 patients (4.5%) had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; six cases) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 11 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these patients had received HU, as sole treatment in seven cases, and preceded or followed by other treatment in seven cases, mainly pipobroman (five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining three leukemic progressions occurred in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> (two cases) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after treatment, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> alone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> with other agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> alone and with other agents, HU alone and with others agents, and pipobroman alone and with other agents was 7% and 9%, 3% and 17%, 3.5% and 14%, and 0% and 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 17 patients who progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had successful cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of them had rearrangements of chromosome 17 (unbalanced translocation, partial or complete deletion, isochromosome 17q) that resulted in 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also had a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo Pelger HÃ¼et hypolobulation and vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation, as previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received HU, as the only therapeutic agent in three, and followed by pipobroman in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The three patients who had received no HU and progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had no 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature found cytogenetic analysis in 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurring after ET, 11 of whom had been treated with HU alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five of 35 patients had rearrangements that resulted in 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of them had been treated with HU alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results show that treatment with HU alone is associated with a leukemic risk of approximately 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurring in ET treated with HU (alone or possibly followed by pipobroman) have morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">17p- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that widespread and prolonged use of HU in ET may have to be reconsidered in some situations, such as asymptomatic ET </plain></SENT>
