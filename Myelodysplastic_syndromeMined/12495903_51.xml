<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Novel therapeutic agents and strategies have been introduced into the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in the last years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has led to more treatment options and a better chance of long-term survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but also to uncertainty regarding the optimal use and possible side effects of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Italian Society of Hematology commissioned a project to develop guidelines for the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using evidence-based knowledge and consensus-formation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: An Advisory Council (AC) shaped the project around a series of key clinical questions, performed a systematic search for evidence and graded the available evidence according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A list of clinical questions was mailed to each of 10 senior hematologists composing the Expert Panel (EP): the panelists were asked to rank the most relevant questions, and to formulate answers to the questions according to the tables of evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A scenario phase followed, so as to reach a consensus on the three top ranked questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EP was asked to score patient profiles as appropriate or not appropriate for the therapeutic strategy under scrutiny, according to the RAND technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, from September 2001 to January 2002, four Consensus Conferences conducted according to the Nominal Group Technique were held in Milan, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall goal of the conferences was to take a final decision upon the appropriateness of the uncertain scenarios and of the uncertain responses to the clinical questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence was judged sufficient for providing recommendations on the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-like chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, low-dose chemotherapy, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi>, immunosuppressive therapy, hypomethylating agents and hematopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific recommendations for supportive therapy, including iron chelation, were issued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was unanimously considered as the only curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and recommendations on its use were agreed based on patient's age, risk, clinical features and donor availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like chemotherapy was also considered a valuable therapeutic option for subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem cell transplantation was recommended for patients who lack an HLA identical donor and have achieved complete remission with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi>, recombinant human erythropoietin and immunosuppressive therapy were judged valuable therapeutic options for subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients whereas low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Specific therapeutic strategies for those subjects younger than 18 years or older than 75 years and the strategy of watchful waiting were decided by patient-oriented questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Using evidence and consensus, recommendations for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were issued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Statements were graded according to the strength of the supporting evidence and uncertainty was explicitly declared </plain></SENT>
