<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined microsatellite instability (MSI) at 10 loci of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeats using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow DNA was obtained from 45 patients repeatedly during the disease course and fibroblast DNA was also collected from 19 of them as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 19 patients showed an alteration at more than three loci, when the allele length was compared between their fibroblast DNA and the initial marrow DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, none of the 45 patients showed an alteration when the initial sample was compared with the latest one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the three patients with MSI had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts and none of them showed disease progression, complex chromosome abnormality, karyotypic evolution, or mutation of N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> or TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a frameshift mutation within 10 repeating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenines</z:chebi> of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor gene, which was recently recognized as a critical target of MSI, was not found in any of the patients including the three with MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MSI is an early but infrequent genetic event and is independent of other critical genetic aberrations in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
