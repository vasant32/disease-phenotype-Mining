<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We previously underwent a clinical trial involving the dose adjustment of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> depending on the individual pharmacokinetics using a test dose in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one Japanese patients aged from 16 to 67 years were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 0.5 mg/kg as a test dose, blood samples were collected at five time points from each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the individual parameters were estimated by using the nonlinear mixed effects model computer program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was sufficient to describe the concentration-time profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final pharmacokinetic parameter were the clearance (CL/F) = 0.153 L/h/kg, distribution volume (Vd/F) = 0.695 L/kg, and absorption rate constant (ka) = 2.39 h(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inter-individual variabilities in CL/F, Vd/F and ka were 25.9, 26.2, and 111.8%, respectively, and the residual variability was 12.1% as the coefficient of variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in Japanese adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The final population model was implemented into the program excel, leading to an easy and proper therapeutic monitoring of oral BU by using small number of samples </plain></SENT>
