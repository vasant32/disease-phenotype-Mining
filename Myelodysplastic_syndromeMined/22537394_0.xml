<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether peripheral blood (PB) can be substituted for bone marrow in these cases and can provide the same information remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concurrent BM and PB specimens collected from 100 patients with recently diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied using both CCS and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While 68% of BM samples showed an abnormal karyotype by CCS, only 31% of PB samples were abnormal by CCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12% of patients, FISH and CCS were discordant due to the inability of the FISH panel to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, only one case (1%) had a cryptic abnormality detected by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM and PB FISH were discordant in 3% of cases, most likely due to the smaller clone size in PB vs. BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While PB should not be substituted for BM at diagnosis, it is a viable alternative for monitoring patients using the appropriate FISH probe(s) </plain></SENT>
