<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Does conditioning with fractionated total body irradiation (fTBI) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu) causes less salivary dysfunction compared with single dose (sTBI) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 74 adolescents below 13 years of age received allogeneic HSCT and conditioning with either: sTBI, fTBI or Bu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unstimulated (USSR) and stimulated (SSSR) whole salivary secretion rates were measured at 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Irrespective of conditioning type, there were no significant differences in USSR or SSSR between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Girls had a significantly lower SSSR, 0.7 ± 0.3 ml per min compared with 1.1 ± 0.4 ml per min in boys (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between age at HSCT and SSSR at 15 years of age (P = 0.02) in children conditioned with sTBI was found as well as an inverse correlation between the plasma area under curve (AUC) of Bu and SSSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model, only female sex was significantly correlated with low SSSR at 15 years of age (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.21-12.79; P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No differences in long-term whole salivary function after HSCT in adolescents receiving conditioning with sTBI, fTBI or Bu were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total systemic exposure to Bu was negatively correlated with stimulated salivary secretion </plain></SENT>
