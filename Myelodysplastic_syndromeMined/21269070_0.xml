<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had one of the "specific" rearrangements of de novo ANLL (inv(16), t(8;21), t(15;17)or t(9;11)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (4 cases) or single cytogenetic rearrangements not involving chromosomes 5 and 7: <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (2 cases), t(1,2)(1 case), 20q deletion (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 patients with "specific" rearrangements had tANLL at presentation, without a preceding myelodysplastic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 8 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or other single cytogenetic rearrangements presented with tMDS, and the remaining patient with tANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients achieved complete remission (CR), 2 had hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 1 had resistant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial disease free interval (DFI) was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant prognostic factor for achieving CR was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly longer DFI was found in patients with "specific" chromosome rearrangements, compared to other karyotypes, and in patients who presented with tANLL, compared to those who presented with tMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those 2 prognostic factors strongly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to tANLL and tMDS with rearrangements of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 or complex karyotypes, patients with tANLL or tMDS who had other abnormal cytogenetic findings seem to achieved a high CR rate with intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>tANLL with "specific" rearrangements achieved prolonged CR in many cases, whereas tMDS with other abnormal karyotypes generally had short CR, like their de novo counterparts </plain></SENT>
