<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) technique was performed for the amplification of six inhibitory KIR genes (KIR2DL1-2DL4, 3DL1-3DL2) and six activating KIR genes (KIR2DS1-S5, 3DS1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods of KIR-SSP was used to determine the KIR genotypes of 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients, including 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid-lymphoblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (AMLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>54 patients were classified as high risk group (n = 27) and standard risk group (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of KIR in NK cells and T cells was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of activating KIR genes in standard risk group were higher than those in high risk group, especially 2DS1 (p = 0.014), or 2DS2 (p = 0.046), or 3DS1 (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of inhibitory KIR genes in standard risk group were similar to those in high risk group (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of activating KIR genes were also higher in standard risk patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as compared with those in high risk patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, particularly 2DS1 (66.7% vs 29.4%, p = 0.022), 2DS2 (57.6% vs 17.6%, p = 0.013), and 2DS3 (33.3% vs 5.9%, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients in high-risk group who expressed more than two kinds of activating KIRs were lower that those in standard-risk group (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the expressions of CD158a, CD158b, and CD158e on NK cells and T cells between high-risk group and standard-risk group (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, different expressions of activating KIR genes were found in patients between high-risk group and standard-risk group </plain></SENT>
