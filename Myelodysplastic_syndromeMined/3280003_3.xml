<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myeloid colony-forming cells were enriched 23-fold and erythroid progenitors 5-7-fold but, in both cases, retained their abnormal growth characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After enrichment and removal of lymphocytes and monocytes, erythroid burst formation became markedly more dependent on the addition of 5637 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> conditioned medium as an exogenous source of haemopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that lymphocytes and monocytes usually support erythropoiesis in cultures of myelodysplastic marrow and demonstrates that erythroid burst-forming progenitor cells from myelodysplastic patients can respond to these populations in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haemopoietic failure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> appears to result from a defect within the preleukaemic clonogenic cell, rather than from an aberration in exogenous factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure outlined here can be used as a first step towards the isolation of these abnormal progenitors </plain></SENT>
