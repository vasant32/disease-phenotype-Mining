<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The day of the cord stem cell transfusion was counted as Day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD prophylaxis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved on Day 30, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade II developed on Day 45 and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 68 the patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and was intubated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cranial CT scan showed a mass effect on the right basal ganglia, and high signal intensities on the T2-weighted and FLAIR images of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination were detected in the bilateral basal ganglia and posterior lobes, the findings of which were compatible with a <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since an increased level of apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values on the bilateral basal ganglia was noted, we suspected that vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> had caused the mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She went into remission immediately after CsA treatment was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this case was diagnosed as atypical reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (RPLS) associated with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CsA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> presenting a mass effect in clinical imaging findings is very rare, and an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map may be useful for the diagnosis of RPLS </plain></SENT>
