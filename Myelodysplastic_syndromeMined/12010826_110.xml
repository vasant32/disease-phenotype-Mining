<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To improve the clinical outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor, the identification of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles responsible for immunologic events such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), engraftment failure, and graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genomic typing of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 was retrospectively performed in 1298 donor-patient pairs in cases where marrow was donated from serologically HLA-A, -B, and -DR compatible donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single disparities of the HLA-A, -B, -C, or -DRB1 allele were independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, and the synergistic effect of the HLA-C allele mismatch with other HLA allele mismatches on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-A and/or HLA-B allele mismatch was found to be a significant factor for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA class I (A, B, and/or C) allele mismatch caused a significantly higher incidence of engraftment failure than HLA match </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant association of HLA-C allele mismatch with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the result of these events, HLA-A and/or HLA-B allele mismatch reduced overall survival remarkably in both standard-risk and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases, whereas the HLA-C mismatch or HLA-class II (DRB1 and/or DQB1) mismatch did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, multiple mismatch of the HLA locus was found to reduce survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the role of the HLA class I allele in unrelated bone marrow transplantation was elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, HLA-C alleles had a different mode from HLA-A or -B alleles for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and survival </plain></SENT>
