<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A point mutation in codon 187 (Pro to Ser) results in complete loss of enzyme activity in homozygous subjects, whereas those with 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of homozygosity for the mutant allele among Caucasians and African Americans is 4% to 5% but is higher in Hispanics and Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an unambiguous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we assayed nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 104 patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>; 56 had therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 30 had a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 9 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> de novo, and 9 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells karyotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of the t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were homozygous and 41% were heterozygous for the NQO1 polymorphism; these proportions were significantly higher than those expected in a population of the same ethnic mix (P =.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients who had clonal abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, 7 (16%) were homozygous for the inactivating polymorphism, 17 (38%) were heterozygous, and 21 (47%) had 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles for NQO1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, NQO1 mutations were significantly increased compared with the expected proportions: 5%, 34%, and 61%, respectively (P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An abnormal chromosome no. 5 or 7 was observed in 7 of 8 (88%) homozygotes, 17 of 45 (38%) heterozygotes, and 21 of 51 (41%) patients with 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 33 patients with balanced translocations [14 involving bands 11q23 or 21q22, 10 with inv(16) or t(15;17), and 9 with t(9;22)], there were no homozygotes, 15 (45%) heterozygotes, and 18 (55%) with 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas fewer than 3 homozygotes were expected among the 56 t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, 6 were observed; 19 heterozygotes were expected, but 23 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene frequency for the inactivating polymorphism (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>31) was increased approximately 1.4-fold among the 56 t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This increase was observed within each of the following overlapping cohorts of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients: the 43 who had received an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, the 27 who had received a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi>, and the 37 who had received any radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, the frequency of an inactivating polymorphism in NQO1 appears to be increased in this cohort of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, especially among those with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or an abnormality of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes and heterozygotes (who are at risk for treatment-induced mutation or loss of the remaining <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele in their hematopoietic stem cells) may be particularly vulnerable to leukemogenic changes induced by carcinogens </plain></SENT>
