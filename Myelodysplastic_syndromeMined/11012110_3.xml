<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 220 bone marrow specimens examined, 30 contained dysplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of these dogs were evaluated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve were categorized as primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and 15 were categorized as secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 4 were subcategorized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and 8 were categorized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> was characterized by nonregenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and with prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, greater than 5% myeloblasts in bone marrow, dysplastic features in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow cell lines, and short survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of this study indicate that differentiating primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> has both therapeutic and prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dogs with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> tend to have prolonged survival and respond to erythropoietin treatment, whereas dogs with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> have short survival and do not respond to standard treatments </plain></SENT>
