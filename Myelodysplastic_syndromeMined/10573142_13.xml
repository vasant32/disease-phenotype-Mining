<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the total transfusion support required, and its complications and cost, following the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (total period = 79.7 patient-years) in 50 patients followed at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase), 41 patients (82%) required transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median numbers of transfused blood products per patient per year of follow-up in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase were: packed red blood cells (pRBC), 11.1 (range, 0-91.3) units, random donor platelets (RDP), 6.8 (range, 0-581) units, and single donor apheresis platelet packs (SDP): 0 (range, 0-40) collections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> phase (time from diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or last follow-up), median transfusion requirements per patient (n = 5) were 24 (range, 8-88) units pRBC, 94 (range, 24-480) units RDP and 3 (range, 0-19) collections of SDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 80% of patients required either special processing or selection of blood products, had reactions to blood products or required premedications (specified/complicated transfusions); 94% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pRBC and 97% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> platelet transfusions were specified/complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median cost of transfusions per patient was $4048 (range, $0-73210) during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase and $13210 (range, $5288-59010) during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase, the median cost was $4877 (range, $0-67050) per patient-year of follow-up; the major proportion of this cost was for pRBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term support with frequent transfusions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> usually requires specially selected or processed blood products, and is associated with a high incidence of transfusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides baseline data on the costs of transfusion support for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and can be used for comparing resource utilization and costs of long-term transfusion support (supportive care) with growth factor therapy or disease-modifying modalities such as allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
