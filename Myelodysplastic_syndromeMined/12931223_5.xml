<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) might detect occult aberrations in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have used FISH to check 57 MDS patients who were karyo-typically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At clinical diagnosis, FISH revealed a clonal abnormality in 18-28% interphase cells from nine patients, five of whom also presented the same defect on metaphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five out of nine patients, the occult defect effected a change in the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormal FISH pattern was significantly correlated with marrow blast cell percentage (P&lt;10(-3)) and IPSS (P&lt;10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with an occult abnormality showed an overall survival and event-free survival significantly inferior in comparison to those of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FISH (P&lt;10(-3), P&lt;10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression were 15- and eight-fold more frequent in FISH abnormal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, occult defects (1) are revealed in about 15% of CC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, (2) are overlooked by CC either because of the poor quality of metaphases or their submicroscopic nature, (3) are clinically relevant as they may cause a change in the IPSS category and may identify a fraction of CC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients with an unfavorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
