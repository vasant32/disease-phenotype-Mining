<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although in vitro marrow myeloid progenitor cell (CFU-GM) growth stimulated by G-CSF generally remained subnormal, in the majority of neutrophil responders significantly augmented incremental change (termed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) of CFU-GM numbers occurred after treatment, as did neutrophilic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neutrophil non-responders had less prominent in vitro myeloid responses and lower basal neutrophil levels (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following G-CSF treatment, the initially subnormal erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) values underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> in five of 11 patients along with increased reticulocyte responses in vivo, whereas four of the five patients who lacked <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> of BFU-E did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients with persisting cytogenetic abnormalities and increased neutrophilic differentiation in vitro also responded in vivo, suggesting that G-CSF induced in vivo cellular differentiation from the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients who developed blastic responses in vivo had increased CFU-GM growth pre- and post-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate in vivo-in vitro correlations for myeloid and erythroid responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells which related to treatment with G-CSF </plain></SENT>
