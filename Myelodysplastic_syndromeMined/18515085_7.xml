<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that altered secretion of adiponectin and resistin may underlie this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus investigated the role of both total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and resistin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case-control study, we studied 101 cases with incident, histologically confirmed primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 101 controls matched on gender and age between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total and HMW adiponectin, resistin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-3) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lower serum total or HMW adiponectin and/or resistin levels were independently associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> controlling for age, gender, BMI and serum levels of leptin, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (p&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although total and HMW adiponectin were both significantly inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when modelled either in quartiles or continuously, HMW did not offer any substantial additional predictive value over total adiponectin (Odds ratio (OR)=0.91 versus 0.93 for a 1 microg/ml change, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF-I was positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by bivariate analysis and both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were higher in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and higher risk stages, but were not significantly and independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Total and HMW adiponectin may have a protective role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas resistin levels may be decreased via a compensatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
