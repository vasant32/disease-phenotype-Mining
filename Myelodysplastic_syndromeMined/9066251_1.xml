<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental studies suggested that hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation are under a neuroendocrine control and that they change in relation to the 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been shown that the pineal hormone <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (MLT) plays a role in mediating the influence of the psychoendocrine system and of the lighting conditions on the hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, MLT has appeared to regulate hematopoietic cell growth by influencing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, preliminary studies have shown that the pineal hormone MLT may determine some benefits in blood cell disorders, mainly platelet diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On this basis, a pilot phase II study of MLT therapy was performed in patients suffering from persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to different causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study included 14 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was due to bone metastatic involvement in 5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> in 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> in 1, genetic factors in 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="itp">Werlhof's disease</z:e> in the last case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MLT was given orally at 20 mg/day in the evening for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No MLT-related toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A normalization of platelet number was achieved in 8/14 (57%), and platelet mean number significantly increased on MLT therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study would suggest that MLT may be effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to different reasons, for which no effective standard therapy is available </plain></SENT>
