<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have also recently been observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the incidence of 17p deletion detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and of TP53 mutations detected by direct sequencing and their correlation and prognostic value in 26 MDS and 17 AML with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 20 cases with isolated del(5q) or one additional abnormality, no 17p deletion was found and 3 of the 18 cases analyzed (17%) had TP53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 23 patients with complex karyotype, 17p deletion was suspected by conventional cytogenetics in 15 cases and confirmed by FISH in 10 of them, while TP53 mutation was found in 8 of the 15 patients tested (53%), only five of whom had 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the whole patient series, TP53 mutations were associated with shorter survival (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We confirm the existence of TP53 mutations in 17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with del(5q) and complex karyotype, FISH and direct sequencing are complementary techniques to analyze TP53 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that sequencing of the TP53 gene should be included in the study of patients with del(5q) as a single abnormality or in complex karyotype before lenalidomide treatment </plain></SENT>
