<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that vitamin K2 (VK2) has a potent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing activity toward various types of primary cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established a novel cell line, designated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-KZ, from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in blastic transformation, and further investigated the effects of VK2 using this novel cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-KZ shows complex chromosomal anomaly including -4, 5q-, -7, 13q+, 20q-, consistent with that seen in the original patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Culture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-KZ cells in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS lead to steady but very slow proliferation with a doubling time of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the cellular growth rate was significantly accelerated in the presence of various growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, and thrombopoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the cultured cells show the morphological features of myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They are positive for CD7, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD117, and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, about 10% of the cells are more mature metamyelocytes and neutrophils with various dysplastic characteristics such as pseudo-Pelger nuclear anomaly and hypersegmentation, suggesting a potential for differentiation in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As previously reported for cultured primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, exposure to VK2, but not to VK1, resulted in induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-KZ cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 5 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, VK2 treatment induced down-regulation of BCL-2 and up-regulation of BAX protein expression with concomitant activation of caspase-3 (CPP32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptide</z:chebi> functioning as <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-H, suppressed the VK2-induced inhibition of cell growth, suggesting that caspase-3 is, at least in part, involved in VK2-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-KZ cell line can serve as a model for the study of the molecular mechanisms of VK2-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
