<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TET2 haplo-insufficiency occurs through different molecular mechanisms and is promptly revealed by array comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can effectively demonstrate TET2 deletions and is often used to validate molecular results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study 41 MDS patients with and without 4q abnormalities were analyzed with a series of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) probes spanning the 4q22.3-q25 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On conventional cytogenetic (CC) studies, a structural defect of the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q) was observed in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three, one each with a t(1;4)(p21;q24), an ins(5;4)(q23;q24qter), and a t(4;17)(q31;p13) as the sole chromosomal abnormality, FISH with the RP11-356L5 and RP11-16G16 probes, which cover the TET2 locus, produced one signal only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, this same result was achieved in 3 of the remaining 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a TET2 deletion was observed in a total of six patients (14.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TET2 deletion was not correlated with any particular clinical findings or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that 1) FISH is an effective and economical method to reveal cryptic abnormalities of band 4q22-q24 resulting in TET2 deletions; 2) in these patients, TET2 deletion is the unifying genetic event; and 3) the different breakpoints within the 4q22-q25 region suggest that deletions are not mediated by repetitive sequences </plain></SENT>
