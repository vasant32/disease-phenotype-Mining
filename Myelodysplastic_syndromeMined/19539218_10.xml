<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies in HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have reported an association between mismatches in minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAg) and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether single and multiple minor mHAg mismatches are associated with outcomes in 730 unrelated donor, HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 allele-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) between 1996 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), received myeloablative conditioning regimens and calcineurin inhibitor-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis, and most received bone marrow (BM; 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donor and recipient DNA samples were genotyped for mHAg including: HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1 and CD31(125/563) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes included grades III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) and survival; secondary outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD), engraftment, and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single disparities at HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, and HB-1 were not significantly associated with any of the outcomes analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HLA-A2-positive individuals, single CD31(563) or multiple mHAg mismatches in the HVG vector were associated with lower risk of grades III-IV aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we conclude that mHAg incompatibility at HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, and CD31 has no detectable effect on the outcome of HLA matched unrelated donor HSCT </plain></SENT>
