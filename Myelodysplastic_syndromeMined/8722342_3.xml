<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even with HLA identity by microlymphocytotoxicity assay and non-reactive MLC, URD marrow transplant recipients have a higher incidence of graft rejection and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 16 mg/kg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 120 mg/kg (BuCy2) has been shown to be at least as effective in preparation of recipients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> of HLA-identical sibling grafts as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (Cy/TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, concern about a high rejection rate in URD transplants has prevented most centers from using BuCy2 in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From March 1990 to March 1994, 26 patients underwent URD transplantation following preparation with BuCy2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received either standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died on day 16 and 20 without evidence of hematopoietic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients evaluable for engraftment, 23 (96%) had evidence of donor engraftment defined as an ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient who had initial engraftment had late graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within our study group the risk of graft rejection or graft failure does not appear to be higher than that reported for URD transplants utilizing TBI-containing regimens </plain></SENT>
