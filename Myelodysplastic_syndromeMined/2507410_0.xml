<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the BM <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytokinetics of 16 untreated HIV-positive patients whose clinical condition ranged from asymptomatic (stage 1 WR and II CDC classifications) to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (stage 6 WR and IV CDC classifications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM aspirates and iliac crest threphine biopsies were obtained for myelogram and histologic examination, as well as for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> flow cytometric (FMC) DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCM data were compared with those from the BM of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> without BM involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood counts, 2 were anemic, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 4 bicytopenia and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BM cellularity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased, but only 2/16 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had atypical lymphoid aggregates, relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, and 4 had typical myelodysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and WR or CDC grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean proliferative fraction (i.e. the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle) of the HIV-positive patients was 11% (range 5.5-18.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean value for the control patients was 15.1% (range 7.7-26.9%) (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had modal diploid DNA content without aneuploid clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the mechanism of BM failure in HIV-positive patients lies in a reduced proliferative activity whose exact cause is still unclear </plain></SENT>
