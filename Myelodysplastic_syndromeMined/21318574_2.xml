<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfusion dependency is associated with leukemic progression and shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Guidelines recommend iron chelation therapy to manage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, however little is known about the chelation patterns in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was to evaluate iron status and its management in transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 193 patient records from 29 centers were eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 76, and median age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had received an average of 13.4 ± 7.6 RBC units in the past 4 months; 44% had received more than 50 units since their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medium serum ferritin was 1,550 μg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety patients (46.6%) received iron chelation therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (41%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (36%), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between chelated and nonchelated patients in terms of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), French-American-British (FAB), and/or World Health Organization (WHO) status, though chelated patients had received more RBC transfusions (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Iron chelation therapy may be underutilized in transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Undertreatment can be reduced by complementing sound clinical judgment with the generally accepted guidelines of a serum ferritin level &gt;1,000 μg/L and/or two or more RBC transfusions per month for the past year; considering patients on the basis of their IPSS, FAB, and/or WHO status; and individually tailored treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized trials are necessary to establish causally the efficacy of iron chelation therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
