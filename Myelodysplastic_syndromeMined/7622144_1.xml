<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was comprised of 226 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed in accordance with the FAB criteria and followed up in our department between January 1975 and April 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes were found: refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 59 cases; refractory sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RSA), 49 cases; refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 56 cases; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) 48 cases; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following scoring systems were applied: Mufti's 1985, Varela's 1985, Sanz's 1989, Rubio's 1991 and Aul's 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was performed according to Kaplan-Meier actuarial systems and the log-rank test of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Three groups (A, B and C) can be defined by Mufti's system, with median survival of 54.0, 16.0 and 8.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases (138) were included in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A did not reach 25 per cent of actuarial survival probability, whereas groups B and C did at 31.1 and 12.2 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to the morphologic subtypes, RA and RSA were included in groups A and B, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> pertained mostly to group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six cases (33.6 per cent) developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) corresponding to those last groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) The three groups defined by Varela's system (0-1, 2-5 and 6 or more) had median survival of 91.8, 24 and 13 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As in the former system, group 0-1 did not reach 25 per cent actuarial probability, this appearing at 60 and 20 months, respectively, in groups 2-5 and &gt; 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the cytological varieties, RA and RSA among the groups is heterogenous although they were more common within the cases included in groups 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases developing AL were included in the groups 2-5 and &gt; 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) The three groups of the system proposed by Sanz (0-1, 2-3 and 4-5) had median survival of, 55.3, 15 and 12.6 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As in the preceding cases, group 0-1 did not reach the 25 per cent actuarial probability, while this figure appeared at 28.2 months for group 2-3 and at 19.3 months for group 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RA and RSA varieties were included chiefly in group 0-1, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> appear mostly in groups 2-3 and 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the cases and the evolution of AL was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> according to this system, although they predominate in groups 2-3 and 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(4) Using the Aul's system, three groups A, B and C were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 14 months for group C and 24 months for group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For group A, the median survival was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>RA and RSA were exclusive for group A, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> varieties were outstanding in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Regarding the evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> the differences observed had no statistical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>(5) Three prognostic groups were defined by Rubio's system (namely 0-2.5, 3-5.5, &gt; or = 6) with median survival of 53.3, 16.8 and 10.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A striking difference was seen when studying the cumulated survival observed, in each of the three percentages considered, between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The different cytological varieties were reasonably distributed with higher incidence of RA and RSA in group I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This system offers statistical significance when comparing RA with RSA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and, obviously RA+RSA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The evolution into AL also showed statistical significance with respect to the three groups </plain></SENT>
