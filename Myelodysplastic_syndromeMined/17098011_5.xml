<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on health expenses caused by readmissions among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the rate, causes, and evolution of hospitalization after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 140 consecutive patients who received an autologous HSCT (n = 107; 76.4%) or an allogeneic HSCT (n = 33; 23.6%) in our institution from May 2001 through September 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 45 readmissions in 28 patients (20%): three (10%) in the autologous and 25 (90%), in the allogeneic HSCT cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall median age was 35.3 +/- 13.5 years and 54% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hematologic diseases</z:e> were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 1, 4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 2, 7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 2, 7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 2, 7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 3, 11%), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4, 14%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (n = 4, 14%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 10, 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of stay for each readmission was 25 +/- 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median day of readmission was +62.5 (range = +19 to +987); however, 75% occurred between days +30 and +70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of hospitalization were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (n = 24, 54%), due to the graft (n = 14, 31%), graft failure (n = 4, 9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> (n = 2, 4%), and second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (n = 1, 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality due to the transplant was 10 patients (14%) including: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (n = 3), thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (n = 1), and relapse (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a frequent use of hospital resources (20%) after HSCT with patients hospitalized for a median of 25 days, it was beneficial since there were 86% survivors at 36 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
