<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those studies used surrogate markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, especially serum ferritin, and most had a retrospective design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective observational study in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> undergoing myeloablative HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients who were followed for over 1 year, with serial measurements of serum iron parameters, as well as liver and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in ferritin, liver or cardiac iron content in the 12 months following HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although serum ferritin still appeared to have prognostic significance, as previously reported, pre-HSCT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (as reflected in liver iron content) was not associated with increased mortality, relapse, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that the adverse prognostic impact of pre-HSCT hyperferritinemia may be related to factors independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
