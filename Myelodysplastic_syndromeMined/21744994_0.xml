<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 87%, including 83% CR and 4% PR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the median follow-up of 55.0 months, the 2- and 4-year event-free survival (EFS) was 49.0% and 40.3%, and the overall survival (OS) was 73.2% and 62.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gender, age at SCT, type of donor, disease status at SCT, previous autologous transplantation, and complete chimerism by day +100 did not significantly influence EFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, no presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (p=0.029, HR: 2.5),and diagnosis other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (p=0.018, HR: 4.6), and CD34+ dose &lt; 5x106/kg (p=0.010, HR: 2.8) were significant predictors of poor OS </plain></SENT>
