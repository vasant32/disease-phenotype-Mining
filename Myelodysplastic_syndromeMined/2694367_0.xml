<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the GM-CSF treatment a distinct increase in granulocytes was observed, but the reticulocytes and thrombocytes decreased to the point where treatment had to be discontinued after eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After subsequent treatment with EPO the reticulocyte count rose from 0% to 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this rise alone was insufficient to decrease the number of blood transfusions required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thrombocyte count rose to the original values after the cessation of GM-CSF therapy while continuing treatment with EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow investigations were performed before and after GM-CSF treatment and indicated a distinct increase in the myeloid precursor cells after therapy, without an increase in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, an obvious decrease in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis was observed </plain></SENT>
