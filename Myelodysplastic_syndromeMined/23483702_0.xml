<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because MDSs display remarkable clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, with variable evolution and survival ranging from months to years, the predictive factors of prognosis have a key role in optimal therapeutic decisions.The purpose of this paper is to analyze prognostic factors within a group of patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors taken into account are: the number and depth of cytopenias, percentage of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities, intensity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and transfusional dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These factors are related to overall survival, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> free survival, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> complications, leukemic evolution, treatment decisions and the response to treatment.Material and method: The study group comprises of 119 patients diagnosed with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, between 2008 and 2011 in the Hematology Department of Coltea Clinical Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this monitoring period the patients were stratified according to the FAB (French-American-British) morphologic classification.Results: This study revealed that the outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is influenced by the percentage of bone marrow blasts at diagnosis, the number and severity of hematopoietic lineage affected by cytopenia and by the presence of chromosomal abnormalities.Conclusions: The studied prognostic factors have predictive value in terms of survival, leukemic transformation, treatment response and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>-related characteristic complications </plain></SENT>
