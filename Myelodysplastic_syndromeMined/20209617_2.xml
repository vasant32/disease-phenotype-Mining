<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lineage involvement and maturation arrest are considered to have prognostic significance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although the prognostic value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> have been documented, little is known about the impact of eosinophils and basophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic significance of eosinophils and basophils in 1008 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled from 3 centers of the Austrian-German <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Working Group and were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood eosinophils and basophils were quantified by light microscopy, and their impact on survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival was calculated by using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>Eosinophilia</z:hpo> (eosinophils &gt;350/microL) and basophilia (basophils &gt;250/microL) predicted a significantly reduced survival (P &lt; .05) without having a significant impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and basophilia were identified as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH)-independent prognostic variables with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-specific impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although elevated LDH was identified as a major prognostic determinant in IPSS low-risk, intermediate-1 risk, and high-risk subgroups, the condition "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and/or basophilia" was identified as a superior prognostic indicator in the IPSS intermediate-2 risk subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of eosinophils and basophils in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was helpful and may complement the spectrum of variables to optimize prognostication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
