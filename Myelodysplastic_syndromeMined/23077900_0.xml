<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of culture methods for these cells are available on the market, many of them consisting of specialized growing media in combination with growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to optimize a less expensive culture method for bone marrow mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight samples of bone marrow aspirates from patients were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out these 8 samples 2 were from healthy people, 3 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients, 2 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients and 2 from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone aspirates from healthy people were used to optimize the culture method and the rest were used for testing the optimized method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two methods were tried: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell culture starting from whole bone marrow, 2) cell culture after bone marrow separation in density gradient with Histopaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cell culture starting from whole bone marrow gives better yields for mesenchymal stem cells than methods which include gradient density separation of mononuclear cells with Ficoll-Histopaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have optimised a less expensive cell culture method for bone marrow mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
