<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data on visceral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> in cases reported in the" Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan" published by the Japanese society of pathology in 2002 and 2006, and the data in the vital statics in Japan published by Ministry of health, labour and welfare were analyzed epidemiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The estimated numbers of visceral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> were 2,250 out of the estimated total <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 8,976 in 2001, and 2290 out of 9,805 in 2005, respectively, in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the estimated severe cases that we thought direct cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were 1,454 in 2001, and 1,464 in 2005, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the severe cases, the most causative agents were Aspergillus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated numbers of Candida and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Zygomycetes</z:e> were interestingly almost same in the severe cases, but the lethal rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Zygomycetes</z:e> was about 60-80 % , almost twice as that in Candida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We think it is imperative to continuously survey and watch these rates towards the future </plain></SENT>
