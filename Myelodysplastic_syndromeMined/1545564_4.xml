<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated a patient with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved a hematological remission which continued for more than 16 months despite discontinuation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before the treatment with GM-CSF and Epo the patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, required frequent red cell transfusions, and experienced episodes of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, but after the therapy he no longer needed transfusion and no longer had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the patient remained in hematological remission, bone marrow examination revealed trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and cytogenetic analysis showed an abnormal karyotype [48, XY, +8, +der(1q5p)] in 100% of the metaphases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the hematological remission of this patient may not result from the recovery of the non-clonal hematopoiesis of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clone, but result from the monoclonal hematopoiesis of a neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
