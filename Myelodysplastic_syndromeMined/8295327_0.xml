<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF was given by 3 hrs intravenous drip infusion daily for at least fourteen days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and nineteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were evaluable for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood granulocyte counts, especially neutrophil counts and eosinophil counts, increased markedly by the administration of GM-CSF in each disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and nineteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> responded to the GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-related increase of granulocytes were seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but no relation was seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects were observed in some patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1558931" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">flu-like syndrome</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, general <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> were seen most commonly but were transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that GM-CSF is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
