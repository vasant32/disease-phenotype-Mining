<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we set out to investigate the efficacy of low dose clofarabine in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (four intermediate-2/high risk disease) who had failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 73 years (range 65-78) and median cycles of clofarabine received were 2 (range 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An overall response rate of 44% was observed (one CR, one PR, and two HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responders had low risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 12 months (range 6.5-15.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the doses of clofarabine administered were only 12.5-25% of that used in other studies, significant hematologic toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient who had a history of thrombocytopenic gastrointestinal bleed died due to an intracranial bleed despite aggressive platelet support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low dose clofarabine may, therefore, induce response, but with significant toxicities, in patients with low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who fail <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future work involving a larger patient population is needed to establish the role of low dose clofarabine in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
