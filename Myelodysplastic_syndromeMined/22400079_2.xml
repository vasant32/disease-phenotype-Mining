<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the definition of precursor T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-LBL) is based only on histopathology, most cases cannot be diagnosed only by HE sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 95% of T-LBL expresses TdT and TdT is expressed only in lymphoblasts, immunohistochemical demonstration of TdT is mandatory for the diagnosis of TLBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the expression of other precursor cell molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) became overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was treated twice with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her son </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine months later, imaging modalities detected a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_404'>soft tissue tumor</z:mpath> around the left ileal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A biopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were malignant polymorphic lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are positive for CD45, CD45RO, CD34, KIT (CD117), CD99 (MIC-2), p53, CD10, PDGFRA, and Ki67 (labeling=60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were negative for pancytokeratin AE1/3, pancytokeratin CAM5.2, TdT, CD3, CD20, CD79α, CD43, CD56, CD57, CD30, bcl-2, κ-chain, λ-chain, cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, synaptophysin, chromogranin, smooth muscle actin, p63, MPO, CD68, lysozyme, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> esterase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although TdT was negative, other precursor cell markers (KIT, CD34, and CD99) were positive and the lymphoid cells showed T-cell lineage, the diagnosis was T-LBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 11 months after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The author stress that TdT, KIT, CD34 and CD99 should be included in panels of precursor T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the author think that KIT, CD34 and CD99 are helpful for the diagnosis of T-LBL in cases negative for TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further, it is unique that this case was not myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> but precursor T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and that T-LBL develops during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
