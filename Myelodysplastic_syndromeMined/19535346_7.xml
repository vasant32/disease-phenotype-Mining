<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to establish morphological definitions so that monocytes, including immature monocytes, could be separated from the spectrum of monocyte precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were selected to provide a large panel of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic cells at different maturational stages and were submitted to 5 experts, who had previously reached a consensus, on the basis of microscopy, in defining 4 subtypes: monoblast, promonocyte, immature monocyte, mature, monocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They achieved a good concordance rate of 76.6% and a high kappa rate confirming that the criteria for defining the 4 subtypes could be applied consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has now to be established whether these monocyte subtypes correlate with immunological or molecular markers and are clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
