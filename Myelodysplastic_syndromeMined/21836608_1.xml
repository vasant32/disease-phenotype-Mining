<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several reports have suggested roles for RUNX1 as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor, its precise function remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because gene alterations of RUNX1 by themselves do not lead to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in mouse models, additional mutation(s) would be required for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the C-terminal deletion mutant of RUNX1, RUNX1dC, attenuates DNA-damage repair responses in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. γH2AX foci, which indicate the presence of DNA double-strand breaks, were more abundantly accumulated in RUNX1dC-transduced lineage(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) (LSK) cells than in mock-transduced LSK cells both in a steady state and after γ-ray treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling by real-time -PCR array revealed RUNX1dC represses the expression of Gadd45a, a sensor of DNA stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bone marrow cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients harboring the RUNX1-C-terminal mutation showed significantly lower levels of GADD45A expression compared with those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for this mechanism, we found that RUNX1 directly regulates the transcription of GADD45A and that RUNX1 and p53 synergistically activate the GADD45A transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest Gadd45a dysfunction due to RUNX1 mutations can cause additional mutation(s) required for multi-step <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
