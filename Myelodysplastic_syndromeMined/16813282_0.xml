<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is regarded that genetic predisposition and exposure to toxic environmental agents contribute to genetic mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular abnormalities have attracted interest over past years because of their presence in most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, even without noticeable disorders in kariotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Familial incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may be helpful in understanding genetic factors of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe two families in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurred in siblings (3 brothers; sister and brother) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kariotype abnormalities have been noted only in one person of each family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rest of patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kariotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that molecular abnormalities are the cause of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occupational exposure to precise <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> (aluminium, greases, diesels, petrol, metals) was noted in two persons in the first family and correspondingly in one person in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was absence of one <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> common for every member of two reported families </plain></SENT>
