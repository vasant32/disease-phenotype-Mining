<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at exploring the immunophenotypic features of blasts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four-color flow cytometry using conventional and secondary gating strategies was used to immunophenotype blasts and the CD34 positive cells in bone marrow nucleated cells of 29 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed: (1) with progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, the proportion of CD34(+) cells were gradually increased from 8.0%, 46.4% to 76.8% (P &lt; 0.05); (2) using CD45 vs SSC gating strategy, with the transformation of RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, the expression of HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD117 were also gradually increased (P &lt; 0.05), and the expression of CD15 was gradually decreased (P &lt; 0.05); (3) using CD45 vs CD34 gating strategy, the expression of HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD117 on blasts were higher by secondary gating method than those by conventional gating (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in the expression of above-mentioned antigens on CD34(+) cells among different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that conventional gating method can reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression from RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, and secondary gating strategy may accurately reflect the biological features of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal expression of CD34 is related to the immaturity level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of blast cells, which is beneficial to the diagnosis of clinically suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incapable of diagnosing with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
