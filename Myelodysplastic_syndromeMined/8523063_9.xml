<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e>, were prepared for BMT using BU/CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients remain in first remission 18 to 60 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients relapsed after BMT, and four of these patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight additional patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), and 11 died of regimen-related toxicity, primarily systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate at 2 years was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.61), with a 24% probability of relapse (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regimen-related toxicity was manifested primarily as hepatic dysfunction in 72% of patients, with 16% developing overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">venoocclusive disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-radiation-containing preparative regimens offer long-term survival in allogeneic BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that is comparable to that of radiation-containing regimens, and are useful in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring BU levels may reduce regimen-related mortality and improve survival </plain></SENT>
