<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and three patients developed solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis diagnosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two variables significantly associated with new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low incidence of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up </plain></SENT>
