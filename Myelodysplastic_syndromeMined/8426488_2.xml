<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two patients who had been initially diagnosed as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> but subsequently progressed into a leukothrombocytosis state which mimicked a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at the time of their diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and dyshematopoietic features were present in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> for 7 and 18 months, respectively, they developed leukothrombocytosis which responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We speculate that these and other similar patients with this unusual course might constitute an entity distinct from the typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
