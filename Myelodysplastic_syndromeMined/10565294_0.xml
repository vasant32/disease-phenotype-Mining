<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosomal aberrations have been observed in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 76-year-old man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood smear analysis revealed anisocytes, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, and occasional hypersegmented eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subsequent bone marrow biopsy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> disclosed hypercellularity, and morphologic abnormalities within the megakaryocyte, erythroid, and myeloid series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myeloid population was predominantly comprised of eosinophils with varying degrees of dyspoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The constellation of hematologic findings were without a precise categorization according to the FAB classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent cytogenetic techniques demonstrated a ring chromosome 7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 metaphases analyzed in cultured bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five-percent of the analyzed cells showed a ring chromosome composed of both the long and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo>: r(7)(p22q36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining metaphases, the ring was composed of only the short arm: r(7)(p22q10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, these uncommon cytogenetic abnormalities have not been previously reported in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with morphologically atypical bone marrow or peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
