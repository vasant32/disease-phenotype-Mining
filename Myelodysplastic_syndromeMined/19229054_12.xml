<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An activated immune system has been observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> but its exact contribution to disease development and control is not fully clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the one hand an activated and skewed T-cell repertoire has been reported, but on the other hand, decreased natural killer cell function has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immune activation could reflect undesired autoimmune reactions against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic precursor cells as well as effective immune-surveillance against dysplastic clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We have investigated immune effector cells (lymphocyte subsets, lymphocyte activation markers, and natural killer cells) of 40 low and intermediate risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients and compared them to those of 10 age-matched healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have analyzed the cytotoxic capacity of effector cells against autologous bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells of 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients and 2 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, we have found an activated state of lymphocytes, determined by increased percentages of effector T cells with cytotoxic profile, more skewing of the T-cell receptor Vbeta (TCR-Vbeta) repertoire, and decreased frequencies of regulatory T cells, when compared to healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of natural killer cells did not differ between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients and healthy donors, but natural killer cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients expressed increased levels of granzyme B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have demonstrated non-MHC restricted autologous cytotoxicity up to 90% against aberrant hematopoietic precursor cells, presumably mediated by natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data point to a role for active immune-surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, as demonstrated by activated T cells and TCR-Vss skewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autologous cytotoxicity against hematopoietic precursor cells was natural killer cell dependent, which points to an additional role for the innate immune system in immune-surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
