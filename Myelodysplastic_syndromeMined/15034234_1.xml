<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One important clinical problem is the difficulty of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble transferrin receptors (sTfRs) reflect the erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish whether determination of serum sTfR could be useful for the differential diagnosis between RA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), we measured the serum sTfR concentrations, BM cellularity and BM erythroblast percentages in 14 untreated AA and 7 untreated RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum sTfR levels of the RA patients (820.1 +/- 402.8 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those of the AA patients (491.1 +/- 195.2 ng/ml; p = 0.0207) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the serum sTfR values of RA and AA patients also overlapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new index, the 'sTfR-E index' [the ratio of serum sTfR level (ng/ml) to BM cellularity (%) x BM erythroblasts (%)] is proposed, which is expected to reflect the number of transferrin receptors (TfR) on the cell membrane per BM erythroblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sTfR-E index values of the 7 RA patients (0.395 +/- 0.234) were significantly lower than those of the 14 AA patients (2.669 +/- 1.633; p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sTfR-E index values of AA and RA patients overlapped only marginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the sTfR-E index may be a useful new diagnostic tool to distinguish between AA and RA patients </plain></SENT>
