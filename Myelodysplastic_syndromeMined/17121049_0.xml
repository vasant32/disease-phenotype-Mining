<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with excess blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) by FAB standard and randomly divided into the cyclosporin group (the treated group) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15367">alltransretinoic acid</z:chebi> group (the control group), and both were subjected to STBT additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect and changes of peripheral hemogram were observed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate and the total remission rate was 73% and 33% in the treated group, higher than that in the control group (39% and 0) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, white blood cell and blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet count increased</z:e> significantly in the treated group after treatment (P &lt; 0.05), while only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level rose obviously in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate and markedly effective rate in patients with qi-blood deficiency syndrome type were higher than those with other syndrome types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCM-STBT combined with cyclosporin has good efficacy in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and there is well correlation between the therapeutic efficacy and type of TCM syndrome or of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, indicating the STBT is necessory for TCM therapy </plain></SENT>
