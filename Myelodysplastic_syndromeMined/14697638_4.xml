<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and two patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with massive hyperdiploidy (10 patients) or tetraploidy (3 patients) seen at our institution over a 12-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were male and two were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age range was 44-84 years (median, 70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient had a previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and no patient had therapy-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One or more copies of chromosomes 8 and 19 were gained in eight patients each; other frequently gained chromosomes included 13, 15, and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had structural abnormalities in addition to chromosome gain; del(5q) was most common (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients received induction chemotherapy, but only four achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival ranged from 1 to 22 months, with a median of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that massive hyperdiploidy and tetraploidy are infrequent abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, are seen primarily in de novo disease in older male patients and are associated with a low remission rate and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Massive hyperdiploidy and tetraploidy define a prognostically unfavorable cytogenetic group in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
