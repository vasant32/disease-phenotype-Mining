<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of a disease-oriented phase I-II study aimed at evaluating the clinical activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi>) in patients affected by advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> at a daily dose of 45 mg/m2, divided into three 4 h infusions for 3 days (six patients) or as continuous infusion of 50 mg/m2 for 3 days (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> resulted in a significant increase in circulating neutrophils, platelets, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> with respect to pretreatment values in over 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by the improvement of the marrow myeloid relative differentiation index (median fivefold increase in the whole group of patients) and of the myeloid to erythroid cell ratio (median twofold increase) in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four out of ten patients a complete normalization of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) picture (complete hematologic response) was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the percentage of CD34-positive BM cells showed a slow but progressive reduction of early leukemic progenitors in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transient slight BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was obtained in less than 50% of patients while a severe marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was never observed in our group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extra-hematological toxicity was very mild in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of our study indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> is able to induce trilineage hematological responses in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients along with a stable normalization of the PB and BM picture in some of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> appears an active agent in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and this deserves careful investigation in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders </plain></SENT>
