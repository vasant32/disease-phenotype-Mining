<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>-receptor (HUMARA) assay, we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD34+ 38- and committed CD34+ 38+ marrow-derived progenitors, and CD16+ 14- granulocytes, CD14+ monocytes, CD3+ T and CD19+ B lymphocytes from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD3+ T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14/18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome inactivation patterns of CD19+ B cells were highly concordant with CD3+ T cells except for two patients (one RA, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes, therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a B-cell disorder in these particular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy, polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission </plain></SENT>
