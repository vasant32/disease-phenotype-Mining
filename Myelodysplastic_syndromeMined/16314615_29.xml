<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred seven patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (stage III to IV, or earlier stage with systemic symptoms or bulky disease) were randomly assigned between ABVD and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> specified before randomization as alternating <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, vinblastine, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (ChlVPP) with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (PABIOE), or hybrid ChlVPP/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (EVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was planned for incomplete response or initial bulk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 52 months median follow-up, 212 event-free survival (EFS) events (disease progression or any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the primary comparison, at 3 years EFS was 75% (95% CI, 71% to 79%) for ABVD and 75% (95% CI, 70% to 79%) for <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.37; HR more than 1.0 favors ABVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90% (95% CI, 87% to 93%) in patients allocated ABVD and 88% (95% CI, 84% to 91%) in patients allocated <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> (HR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> experienced more grade 3/4 infection, mucositis, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was reported, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the two <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> are compared separately with ABVD, neither the alternating nor the hybrid regimen showed a statistically significant difference from ABVD for EFS or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis suggested that <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> may be associated with poorer outcomes in older patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> test of OS older or younger than 45 years, P = .020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of significant difference in EFS or OS between ABVD and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi> in the trial overall or if the two <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> versus ABVD comparisons are considered separately </plain></SENT>
