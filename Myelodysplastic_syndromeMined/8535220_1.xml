<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were several exceptions in some cases and IL-1R expression was found to vary in a rather wide range, however, the expression of IL-2R and IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> tended to increase during the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, IL-2R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased in four patients with GVHD and graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-2R and IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was not increased in autologous (auto) BMT and auto peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IL-2R and maybe IL-6R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in PBMC play an important role in the development of an allo response and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the analysis of cytokine receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in PBMC after allo BMT may provide important information concerning the immune response and the cytokine network system in marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
