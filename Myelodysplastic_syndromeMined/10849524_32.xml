<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progenitor cells were mobilised into the blood by giving the donors 10 microg/kg/day G-CSF subcutaneously for 5-7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was not given to patients after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time to neutrophil counts &gt;0.5 x 109/l was 17 days (95% CI 15.2-18.8 days) in the PBPC group compared to 23 (95% CI 20.3-25.7 days) in the BM group (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time to platelet counts &gt;20 x 109/l was 13 days (95% CI 11.7-14.3 days) in the PBPC group and 21 days (95% CI 18.7-23.3 days) in the BM group (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD of grades II-IV developed in six patients transplanted with PBPC and three patients transplanted with BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were 15 and 8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-free survival showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplantation with PBPC appears preferable for the recipient due to faster neutrophil and platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the final conclusion can not be drawn before long-term results on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and relapse incidence in longer randomised trials are available </plain></SENT>
