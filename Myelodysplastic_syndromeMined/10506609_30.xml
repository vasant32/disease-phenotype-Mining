<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The absolute risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) after autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) exceeds 5% in several reported series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the outcome of a large cohort of patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after ABMT for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1982 and December 1997, 552 patients underwent ABMT for NHL, with a uniform ablative regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation followed by reinfusion of obtained marrow purged with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was strictly defined, using the French-American-British classification system, as requiring bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in at least two cell lines, with associated unexplained persistent cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at a median of 47 months after ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 7.4%, and actuarial incidence at 10 years is 19.8%, without evidence of a plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received significantly fewer numbers of cells reinfused per kilogram at ABMT (P =.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes were performed on bone marrow samples of 33 patients, and 29 patients had either del(7) or complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival from diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 9.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> failed to predict outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients underwent allogeneic BMT as treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have died of BMT-related complications (11 patients) or relapse (two patients), with a median survival of only 1.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up demonstrates a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after ABMT for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for these patients is uniformly poor, and novel treatment strategies are needed for this fatal disorder </plain></SENT>
