<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EPOCH regimen and rituximab monotherapy have demonstrated activity as salvage therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of their non-overlapping toxicity, we evaluated their combination as salvage therapy in a phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive large B-cell and mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were offered treatment with rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on day 1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 15 mg/m2 as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 2-4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 65 mg/m2 as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 2-4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 0.5 mg as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 2-4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 750 mg/m2 i.v. on day 5 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients, with a median age of 56 years (range 23-72), entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five had primary diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 18 transformed large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and seven mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 1.7 (range one to four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of treatment cycles was four (range one to six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Objective responses were obtained in 68% of patients (28% complete responses, 40% partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients received consolidating high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 33 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed a secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 17.9 months; the projected overall survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 66, 42 and 35%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median event-free survival was 11.8 months; the projected event-free survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 50, 30 and 26%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rituximab-EPOCH regimen is effective and well tolerated, even in extensively pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
