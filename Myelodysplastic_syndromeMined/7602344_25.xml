<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Since large numbers of patients with early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> now receive adjuvant chemotherapy containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, a known leukemogenic agent, it is important to determine the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developing in patients treated on six clinical adjuvant chemotherapy trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients population included 2,638 patients with previously untreated primary operable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> entered onto six clinical trials conducted by the ECOG between 1978 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are 19,200 persons-years of follow-up study and a mean follow-up duration of 7.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from flow sheets submitted to the ECOG Data Management Office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,638 patients at risk with 19,200 person-years of follow-up study, three patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (two with a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; however, one had adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated with human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and a second patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after receiving additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is three per 19,200 or 16 per 100,000 person-years of follow-up study with a 95 percent confidence interval of three to 46 per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients (three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) are included, the estimated incidence rate is five per 19,200 or 26 per 100,000 person-years of follow-up study with a 95 percent confidence interval of eight to 61 per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who receive standard-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-containing adjuvant chemotherapy is not much higher than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, physicians must remain alert to the possible long-term consequences of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
