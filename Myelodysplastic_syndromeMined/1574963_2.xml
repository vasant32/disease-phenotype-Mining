<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to determine predictors of response to recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) therapy in 20 patients with various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), plasma concentrations of transferrin receptor protein were measured before and after 4 doses of r-HuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An r-HuEPO dosage of 150 U/kg was administered subcutaneously 3 times weekly and increased to 300 U/kg in patients who failed to raise plasma concentrations of transferrin receptor protein by at least one third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten (50%) patients had an effective clinical response to therapy by reducing (greater than 50%) or eliminating transfusion requirements, or by showing an improvement in haematocrit of greater than or equal to 6 percentage points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in plasma transferrin receptor protein concentrations failed to predict which patients would eventually respond to r-HuEPO therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients demonstrated a delayed response to therapy in order to achieve a satisfactory clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precise predictors of response, either laboratory or clinical, remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continued research is warranted in this group of patients in order to specifically target r-HuEPO therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is, however, likely that r-HuEPO therapy will have an effective and important role in this subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
