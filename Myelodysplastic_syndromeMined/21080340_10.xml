<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent Phase I trial testing the lenalidomide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> combination yielded encouraging results; however, lenalidomideâ€™s contribution was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 18 higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were treated with the combination for seven cycles, after which lenalidomide was discontinued in eight patients who achieved a complete response, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> monotherapy continuing until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on three patients who relapsed on monotherapy with excess blasts at 12, 19, and 24 months, in whom lenalidomide was then resumed in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient, one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics at relapse; one with a 18 abnormality; and one with del(4q25), recaptured a complete response that was sustained for 5, 7, and 7+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the addition of lenalidomide to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> provides additional clinical benefit over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
