<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had more than 10% CD34 positive blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival for the CD34 positive patients was 125 days and for the CD34 negative patients the median survival has not yet been reached at day 575 (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those patients who received intensive chemotherapy, CD34 positive patients (n = 13) had a median survival of 150 days while for CD34 negative patients (n = 14) the median survival has not yet been reached (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age and pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> did not affect the correlation of CD34 positivity with survival (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the period of observation (median 10 months, range 2-19 months) the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 5 times greater for the CD34 positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that CD34 expression is an adverse prognostic marker, independent of age and pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
