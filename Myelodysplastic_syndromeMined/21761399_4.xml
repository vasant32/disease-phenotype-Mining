<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> for the treatment of high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> has prompted the issue of its potential role even in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed 82 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 72 years (range, 29-87 years), and 27 patients (33%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 62 patients with evaluable cytogenetics, 18 patients (29%) had a poor-risk karyotype, and 44 patients (71%) had an intermediate karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (43%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> as front-line treatment, and 47 patients (57%) had previously received 1 or more line of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 32% (26 of 82 patients) and included 12 (15%) complete remissions (CRs), 4 (5%) CRs with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), and 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed more frequently among untreated patients compared with pretreated patients; in fact, 17 of 35 untreated patients (48%) responded, including 11 responses (31%) classified as CR/CRi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, only 9 of 47 pretreated patients (19%) responded, including 5 responses (11%) that were classified as CR/Cri </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response rate was significantly higher for untreated patients (P = .006) and those who had white blood cell counts &lt;10 × 10(9) /L (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For untreated patients who achieved a response, the median overall response duration was 13 months, and the 1-year and 2-years overall survival rates were 58% and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> promises to be an effective therapy for elderly patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and with white blood cell counts &lt;10 × 10(9) /L </plain></SENT>
