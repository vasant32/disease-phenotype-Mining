<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the feasibility of administering cell-mediated immunotherapy with family-related haploidentical lymphocytes following autologous bone marrow transplantation in order to evoke a graft-vs-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect in the autologous setting.Twenty-six patients aged 1.5-48 years were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, seven from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were transplanted in first remission, six in second remission, one in fourth remission, and eight in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi>/Thiotepa/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (Group A) were treated with gradual increments of haploidentical donor T cells, starting on day +1, with an additional course of T cells plus intravenous recombinant human interleukin-2 one month later if no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> developed in the interim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (Group B) were treated with high-dose haploidentical T cells on day +1 in conjunction with intravenous recombinant human interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Donor cells were detected in the peripheral blood of both groups 12-48 hours post-cell-mediated immunotherapy, peaking at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients in Group A developed transient Grade I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient in Group B developed Grade I, and three Grade IV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group A patients engrafted normally, but the Group B patients with Grade IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> showed no signs of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show that it is feasible to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> in the autologous stem cell transplantation setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the high-dose regimen of haploidentical T cells in conjunction with interleukin-2 results in severe toxicity and nonengraftment </plain></SENT>
