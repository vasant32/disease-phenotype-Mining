<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observations for mutations of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>Runt</z:mp> domain of the AML1 gene in bone marrow cells were made in 300 patients, including 131 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 94 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 28 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 3 with atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 41 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-one of the patients had chromosome 21 abnormalities, including t(8;21) in 6 of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, t(12;21) in 8 patients with ALL, acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 in 17 patients, tetrasomy 21 in 7 patients, and constitutional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>) in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A point mutation was found in 14 cases (4.7%), including 9 (22%) of the 41 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> of the Mo type (MoAML) (none of them had detectable chromosome 21 rearrangement) and 5 (38%) of the 13 myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (1 M1AML, 2 M2AML, 1 ET, and 1 atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In at least 8 of 9 mutated cases of MoAML, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> alleles were mutated: 3 patients had different stop codon mutations of the 2 AML1 alleles, and 5 patients had the same missense or stop codon mutation in both AML1 alleles, which resulted in at least 3 of the patients having duplication of the mutated allele and deletion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> residual allele, as shown by FISH analysis and by comparing microsatellite analyses of several chromosome 21 markers on diagnosis and remission samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining mutated cases, with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, a missense mutation of AML1, which involved 2 of the 3 copies of the AML1 gene, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 7 mutated cases could be reanalyzed in complete remission, and no AML1 mutation was found, showing that mutations were acquired in the leukemic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings confirm the possibility of mutations of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>Runt</z:mp> domain of the AML1 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, mainly in MoAML and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AML1 mutations, in MoAML, involved both alleles and probably lead to nonfunctional AML1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As AML1 protein regulates the expression of the myeloperoxidase gene, the relationship between AML1 mutations and Mo phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> will have to be further explored </plain></SENT>
