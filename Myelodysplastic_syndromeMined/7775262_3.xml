<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After oral administration at a dose of 30 mg/m2, the time required to reach the peak plasma level of ATRA (20-1198 ng/ml) was between 120 and 240 min and the apparent plasma elimination half life was 21-51 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> was detected in the plasma of seven patients, indicating the occurrence of ATRA isomerization in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATRA therapy did not induce complete remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, even when high plasma levels were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the six APL patients given ATRA therapy, one who failed to respond had a very low plasma ATRA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that it may be useful to monitor plasma levels during oral ATRA therapy in order to achieve an appropriate treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
