<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (35%) were heterozygous at the HPRT or PGK loci for BamHI or BglI RFLPs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight patients showing PGK polymorphisms, clonality was determined by X-chromosome inactivation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included patients from different morphologic subtypes: four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), two with RA and ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), one patient with RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation was observed in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a further case characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo>, peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes were polyclonal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> therapy, reversion to polyclonal hematopoiesis was observed in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> indicating the presence of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells with the capacity for marrow reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clonal relation of lymphoid and granulocyte/monocyte lineages was studied directly in two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of N-ras or Ki-ras oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By selective oligonucleotide hybridization to ras gene sequences amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction, a mutated ras allele was demonstrated in PB granulocytes, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes of both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> arise from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell with the potential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
