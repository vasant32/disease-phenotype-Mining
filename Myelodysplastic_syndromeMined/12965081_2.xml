<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unusually high incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in S-phase cells is characteristically found in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, E2F1, c-myc, and Cyclin D1 have been shown to bring about both S-phase changes and/or apoptotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have already found a stoichiometric imbalance between pRb and E2F1 causing deregulated E2F1 activity in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the status of Cyclin D1 in relation to E2F1 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 19 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in comparison with 6 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 was localized immunohistochemically using a specific monoclonal antibody (1:150 dilution) in plastic-embedded BM sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nuclear localization of Cyclin D1 graded on a subjective rating scale of 0 (negligible staining) to 8+ (highest), demonstrated negligible levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrows (median 1+), and in 11/19 evaluable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 8/19 MDS biopsies showed an almost four-fold increase in Cyclin D1 localization (p&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A western blot analysis of E2F1 in corresponding bone marrow (BM) aspirate mononuclear cells (MNC) demonstrated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with elevated Cyclin D1 expression also had a significant increase in E2F1 protein (p&lt; or =0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these patients revealed higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of one of the E2F1 transcriptional target genes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (DHFR, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the relationship of Cyclin D1 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was elucidated in a colocalization experiment in BM biopsy sections using immunohistochemistry for Cyclin D1 and in situ end labeling of DNA (ISEL) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of ISEL-positive apoptotic cells was several fold higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMs (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 7-41% (median 20%) of the apoptotic cells in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BMs revealed co-localization of Cyclin D1 in their nucleus, whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMs co-localization was virtually absent (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of bone marrow cells may involve Cyclin D1/E2F1 pathway </plain></SENT>
