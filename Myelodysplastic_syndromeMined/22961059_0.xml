<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, involvement of the Hh-signaling system in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment during the development of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the expression of Hh-related genes in primary human CD34(+) cells, CD34(+) blastic cells and BM stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both Indian Hh (Ihh) and its signal transducer, smoothened (SMO), were expressed in CD34(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)-derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Ihh expression was relatively low in BM stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, expression of the intrinsic Hh-signaling inhibitor, human Hh-interacting protein (HHIP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>-derived stromal cells was markedly lower than in healthy donor-derived stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HHIP expression levels in BM stromal cells highly correlated with their supporting activity for SMO(+) leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of HHIP gene in stromal cells increased their supporting activity although control cells marginally supported SMO(+) leukemic cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The demethylating agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> rescued HHIP expression via demethylation of HHIP gene and reduced the leukemic cell-supporting activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>-derived stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that suppression of stromal HHIP could be associated with the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
