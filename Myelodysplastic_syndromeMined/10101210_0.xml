<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are several therapeutic options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients but the potentially curative ones are only available for a minority of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, in fact, the only two treatments that can prolong survival are allogeneic stem cell transplantation and intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only two haematopoietic growth factors that can be useful in the treatment of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall 15 to 20% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> respond to rHuEpo treatment but the vast majority of responders are not transfusion-dependent and the doses required to achieve response are &gt; 450 IU/kg per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting response include serum Epo levels &lt;100 mU/ml, female gender and no or low need for transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recognising potential responders to rHuEpo can be extremely important in individual cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF alone should be used only for short-term treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be administered to individual patients during an infective episode that does not respond to antibiotic therapy, particularly in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, G-CSF may be employed for shortening the length of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> following intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>American and Scandinavian studies have shown that about 40% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients respond to a combined treatment of rHuEpo with G-CSF with amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and that response can be maintained for a median duration of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using pre-treatment serum Epo levels as a ternary variable (&lt;100, 100-500 or &gt; 500 U/l) and red blood cell transfusion need as a binary variable (&lt;2 or &gt; or =2 units per month), a predictive score for erythroid response to G-CSF plus rHuEpo can be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This score can identify patients with a high probability of erythroid responses (about 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Due to the inadequacies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> current treatment modalities, participation in clinical trials should always be encouraged </plain></SENT>
