<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) OKT3, OKT4 and OKT8 combined with SRBC rosettes, the authors found that there was a significant decrease of OKT3-defined Pan-T lymphocytes in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This reduction was primarily confined to the OKT4-defined helper subset, but there was a relative increase in the OKT8-defined suppressor subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, the ration OKT4/OKT8 was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data of MLC test also showed abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity function in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these observed changes in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was discussed </plain></SENT>
