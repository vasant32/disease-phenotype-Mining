<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with two unrelated clones, one of which was t(11;17)(q23;q25) carrying MLL-SEPT9 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 71-year-old man who was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M0 and received multiple chemotherapy regimens, including DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the karyotype of bone marrow cells at the initial diagnosis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, two unrelated chromosomal aberrations concurrently appeared during the course of the disease, suggestive of t(11;17)(q23;q25) and add(1)(p36.1),del(6)(q?) by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectral karyotyping analysis identified a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 11 and 17, and a translocation of the q arm of chromosome 6 to chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis that used probes specific for MLL in combination with tel 1p and tel 1q revealed a translocation of 1p--&gt;pter to chromosome 6 and a translocation of 11q23--&gt;qter to chromosome 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses demonstrated MLL-SEPT9 fusion transcripts with the breakpoint of MLL exon 8/SEPT9 exon 2 and MLL exon 9/SEPT9 exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the karyotype was defined as 46,XY,t(11;17)(q23;q25)/46,XY,t(1;6)(p36.3;q23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case represents an additional MLL-SEPT9-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that was considered to be related to therapy </plain></SENT>
