<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival (OS) was 80% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemias</z:hpo>, 57% in refractory cytopenias, 51% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>), 28% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e>, and 25% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = .001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, WHO classification showed a significant effect on OS (P = .017) and probability of relapse (P = .01); transfusion dependency was associated with a reduced OS (P = .01) and increased TRM (P = .037), whereas WPSS showed a prognostic significance on both OS (P = .001) and probability of relapse (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients without excess blasts, multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and transfusion dependency affected OS (P = .001 and P = .009, respectively), and were associated with an increased TRM (P = .013 and P = .031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, WPSS identified 2 groups with different OS and TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that WHO classification and WPSS have a relevant prognostic value in posttransplantation outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
