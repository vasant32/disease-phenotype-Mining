<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation demonstrated the presence of abnormal ANAE positive granulocyte populations in a significant proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells, in which the staining patterns were characterized by atypical granular ANAE positivity and double ANAE-chloroacetate reactions, were shown immunologically to lack the receptor and antigenic characteristics of monocytes and morphologically to be granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing, however, indicated that the atypical esterase cytochemistry of these granulocytes was due to the presence of markedly increased concentrations of ANAE isoenzymes usually found in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atypical ANAE-staining granulocytes were particularly evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows showing sideroblastic erythroid changes, whilst in MA they were mainly seen in cases of intermediate severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that these cells are associated with dysmyelopoietic changes in both malignant and non-malignant conditions </plain></SENT>
