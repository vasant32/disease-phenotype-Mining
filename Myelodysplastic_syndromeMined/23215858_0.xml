<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: How a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is disclosed can affect psychological morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Haematological malignancy</z:e> specialised terminology may make the disclosure difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed how disclosure of a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is experienced by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from the French <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> support group were questioned about their demographic and clinical characteristics, diagnosis disclosure circumstances as well as experiences and expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a phase test, a written questionnaire was sent to the 150 members of the support group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 73 patients who returned a useable questionnaire, disclosure had been experienced negatively by 32 patients (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 53% of those patients were satisfied with the information provided compared with 80% of those who had positive/neutral feelings (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients felt they should have been given fuller information at the time of disclosure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In retrospect, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (94%) thought that comprehensive, accurate information should be provided at disclosure, even if the truth might be hard to cope with </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients reporting not having been given satisfactory information complained about a lack of perspective (3) or clarity (7), eight (11%) mentioned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during the interview, and four explicitly expressed that this word should be more frequently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many patients had experienced disclosure negatively, frequently finding that the information provided had been insufficient and feeling that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was not well understood as a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Haematologists disclosing diagnosis to patients with a blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> may benefit from following the same guidelines as oncologists in delivering comprehensive, understandable information </plain></SENT>
