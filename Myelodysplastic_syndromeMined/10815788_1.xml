<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A fourth member, the paternal uncle of the propositus, was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the three affected Individuals had megaloblastoid marrows with recognizable bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities and progressive, nonleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The propositus was unresponsive to G-CSF and eventually died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third affected family member underwent bone marrow transplantation and is showing signs of graft survival despite minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The affected members of this pedigree appear to represent a continuum in severity of disease and, therefore, pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and clinical progression of the disease suggest a genetic defect which may predispose individuals to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
