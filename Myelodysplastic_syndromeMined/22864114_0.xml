<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure of centrosome maturation leaves chromosomes scattered, as seen routinely in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the Miki (LOC253012) gene is frequently deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and that low levels of Miki are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004046'>abnormal mitosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that Miki localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>)ated by tankyrase-1 during late G2 and prophase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARsylated Miki then translocates to mitotic centrosomes and anchors CG-NAP, a large scaffold protein of the Î³-tubulin ring complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to impairment of microtubule aster formation, cells in which tankyrase-1, Miki, or CG-NAP expression is downregulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> show prometaphase disturbances, including scattered and lagging chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that PARsylation of Miki by tankyrase-1 is a key initial event promoting prometaphase </plain></SENT>
