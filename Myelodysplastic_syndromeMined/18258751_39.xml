<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into this coordinate regulation, we examined the role that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (Rb), a central regulator of the cell cycle, plays in erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that Rb serves a cell-intrinsic role and its absence causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo>, with a differentiation block at the transition from early to late erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, in addition to a failure to properly exit the cell cycle, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis fails to be up-regulated concomitantly, contributing to this differentiation block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The link between erythropoiesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was validated by inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis in the absence of Rb resembles the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, where defects in cell cycle regulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function frequently occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our work demonstrates how these seemingly disparate pathways play a role in coordinately regulating cellular differentiation </plain></SENT>
