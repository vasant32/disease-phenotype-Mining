<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of physiologic concentrations of SCF on the proliferation and differentiation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells was further analyzed in the presence of combined cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, marrow CD34+ cells were purified up to 94% for 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 90% for 18 MDS patients, using monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days with saturating doses of cytokines, including recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3) and rSCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clonal growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells supported by a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above cytokines was then subdivided into the two patterns of leukemic or non-leukemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of various concentrations of rSCF (0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 ng ml(-1)), with or without the above cytokines, in proliferation and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells was analyzed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The physiologic concentration of SCF at 5 ng ml(-1) significantly increased undifferentiated 'blast cell' colonies or clusters in leukemic type growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells over that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCF is present in plasma at a level of ng ml(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This means that progenitor cells are continuously exposed to stimulation by SCF in vivo and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> leukemic cells have a growth advantage over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blasts </plain></SENT>
