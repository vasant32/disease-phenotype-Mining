<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess whether pre-high-dose therapy (HDT)-related factors play a critical role in the development of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (tMDS) or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine of 230 patients with a primary diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) developed tMDS/sAML after HDT comprising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total-body irradiation (TBI) supported by autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect clonal cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients showed complex karyotypes at diagnosis of tMDS/sAML containing, in particular, complete or partial loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using single locus-specific FISH probes, significant levels of clonally abnormal cells were found before HDT in 20 of 20 tMDS/sAML patients screened, compared with three of 24 patients screened who currently have not developed tMDS/sAML, at a median follow-up of 5.9 years after HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prior cytotoxic therapy may play an important etiologic role and may predispose to the development of tMDS/sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a triple FISH assay designed to detect loss of chromosomal material from 5q31, 7q22, or 13q14, significant levels of abnormal cells can be detected before HDT and may predict which patients are at increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further prospective evaluation of this FISH assay is warranted to determine its predictive power in this setting </plain></SENT>
