<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Corresponding studies on bone marrow alterations in smokers have not been done until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated bone marrow trephine biopsies of 32 smoking persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies had been mainly performed because of mild peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases we found a moderate increase in granulopoietic cells with a significant shift to the right and a distinct stimulation of phagocytic activity in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to cytochemical findings, neutrophils are the major target of this phagocytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We interpret these results as a smoking induced inhibition of locomotion in segmented neutrophils leading to an accumulation of mature polymorphs in the bone marrow with consecutive break-down and phagocytosis of senescent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose the designation "smokers' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e>" for these changes </plain></SENT>
