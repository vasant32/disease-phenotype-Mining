<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we report on two Caucasian patients with unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with proliferative characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients were suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and underwent splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The weight of the spleen specimens was more than 2000 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathology findings revealed a marked infiltration of the spleen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After surgery, one patient showed a rapid increase of platelets in peripheral blood and developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other case, the patient was suffering from a decrease of platelets and died in hypovolemic shock caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, these two cases demonstrate the difficulties of prognosis and treatment in patients with mixed myelodysplastic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we indicate the potential positive outcome of splenectomy as ultima ratio in patients with these hematological features and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
