<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we and other groups reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) a strong correlation between cytogenetic rearrangements leading to 17p deletion, a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo-Pelger-HuÃ«t hypolobulation and small vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into this "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">17p-syndrome</z:e>," we studied 17 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with 17p deletion by whole chromosome painting (WCP) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes spanning the 17p arm, including a p53 gene probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, 15 patients had unbalanced translocation between chromosome 17 and another chromosome (chromosome 5 in nine cases and unidentified chromosome -add 17p- in three cases), one patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17, and one had i(17q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rearrangements appeared to result in 17p deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had additional cytogenetic rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WCP analysis confirmed the cytogenetic interpretation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and identified one of the cases of add 17p as a t(17;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WCP also identified chromosome 17 material on a marker or ring chromosome in two cases of t(5;17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis with 17p markers made in 16 cases showed no deletion of the 17p markers studied in the last two patients, who had no typical dysgranulopoiesis; p53 mutation analysis in one of them was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 14 other cases, FISH showed a 17p deletion of variable extent but that always included deletion of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients had typical dysgranulopoiesis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one had p53 mutation and/or overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings reinforce the morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular correlation found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">17p-syndrome</z:e> and suggest a pathogenetic role for inactivation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene(s) located in 17p, especially the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
