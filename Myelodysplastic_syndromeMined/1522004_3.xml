<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of 252Th dioxide, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for more than 25 y after its clinical practice introduction in 1930 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its excellence as a contrast medium was ultimately eclipsed by its long-term associated morbidities, and its use essentially ended by 1954 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case history presents the clinical events in the last 10 y of life in a patient injected with Thorotrast in 1953 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient developed three previously described Thorotrast-associated morbidities: pneumococcus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> due to functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001746'>asplenia</z:hpo> and reticuloendothelial system blockade, an enlarging Thorotrastoma (inflammatory mass) at the injection site, and a fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, she developed three clinical syndromes where a Thorotrast association may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She suffered from severe spinal column <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002953'>vertebral collapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0010119'>abnormal bone-density</z:mp> measurement implies the presence of radiodense radioactive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="33385">thorium</z:chebi> or its degradation products as potentially responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune system disregulation with immunoglobulin excess, auto antibodies, and cell-mediated immunity deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This condition is similar to that found in patients infected with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus and may suggest a shared etiology in reticuloendothelial system damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, she developed dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>bilateral cataracts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case history illustrates the temporal relationship of a variety of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Discussion is directed at review of previous data and support for new associations </plain></SENT>
