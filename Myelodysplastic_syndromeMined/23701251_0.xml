<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction consisted of homoharringtonine at 2.5â€‰mg/m(2) via continuous infusion for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance was given every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were enrolled: five with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, two with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation, one each with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 70 years (55-84) and 6 (66%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Per International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) two patients were intermediate-1, five intermediate-2 and two high-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median chemotherapy courses were one (1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (11%) responded with complete haematological and cytogenetic remission after one course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients did not respond (four had stable disease, two progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and two died during induction - from aspergillus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and intracerebral haemorrhage respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 myelosuppression seen in 56% (5/9) </plain></SENT>
