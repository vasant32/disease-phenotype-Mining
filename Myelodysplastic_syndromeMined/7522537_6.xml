<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with myeloid disorders characterised by a karyotype including apparent <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, in the presence of a ring or marker chromosome, were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with a chromosome 7 centromere-specific probe and an Alu-PCR derived chromosome 7 paint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 5 cases a ring chromosome was shown to be of chromosome 7 origin; in one of these the apparent ring was shown to consist solely of chromosome 7 centromeric material, and in the fifth case the ring was derived from chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three cases <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 had arisen during the course of karyotype evolution and was clearly not the primary cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One further case demonstrated fragmentation and cryptic translocation of chromosome 7 material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last case a chromosome described as der(l)t(1;7)(p11;p11) was redefined as dic(1;7)(p11;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The application of FISH has enabled a more accurate characterisation of chromosome abnormalities, and extended studies of this type may eventually lead to more precise prognostic groups defined by karyotype </plain></SENT>
