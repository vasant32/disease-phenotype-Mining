<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: evaluation of results of immunosupressive therapy in children with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Material and methods: SAA was diagnosed in 105 children (42 girls, 73 boys), aged 2-18 years, in the eleven haematological centres in Poland, between 1993-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the Severe Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> Working Party of the EBMT protocol which included: antilymphocyte globulin or antithymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocyto- or granulocytomacrophagic-cell stimulation factor was additionally administered during deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haematological response was evaluated on day 84 or 112 and 180 of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: complete remission occurred in 53 patients (51.5%), partial remission in 27 (24.7%), no response was obtained in 25 children (23.8%) on day 180, of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Period of observation was from 12 months to 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During this time relapse occurred in 10 patients (9.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>: 8 early, during the first 3 months of IS and 14 after the first 3 months of immunosuppresive therapy (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At present 70 children (66.6%) are in first remission with lasts from 12 months to 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival at 12.5-years is 78.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the 12.5 years of follow-up we had two cases with a late clonal complication (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppresive therapy (IS) in children with SAA, without bone marrow family donors, is more effective after introduction of combined IS (12.5 years survival in this study was 80% for children with very severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (v SAA) </plain></SENT>
