<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe 15 consecutive patients (median age 69 years, range 60-75 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=10) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=5) who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received first-line treatment with DAC and subsequent allografting (from sibling donor in four patients, unrelated donor in 11) after reduced-intensity conditioning with the FBM regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful engraftment was attained in 14/15 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom achieved a CR, with a median duration of 5 months (range 1+ to 51+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of these 14 patients are alive (4 with complete donor chimerism), 8 have died either from relapse (n=4) or treatment-related complications while in CR (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allografting after low-dose DAC and subsequent conditioning with FBM is feasible, with no unexpected toxicities and appears as a valid alternative to standard chemotherapy ('InDACtion instead of induction') in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
