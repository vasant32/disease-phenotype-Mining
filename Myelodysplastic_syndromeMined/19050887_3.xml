<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the role of the microenvironment in the pathophysiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), primarily a disease of older age, we determined telomere length in primary cultured marrow stroma cells using quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (qFISH) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>qFISH showed comparable rates of decrease in telomere length with age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere length assessment by qPCR showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a lack of significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls in terms of telomere stability in marrow stroma in contrast to that observed in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this demonstrates that, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma cells and hematopoietic cells share the same microenvironment, the stromal cells do not share the processes that contribute to accelerated telomere attrition, suggesting that stromal cell proliferative potential is not limiting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
