<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, an effective mobilization of CD34-positive cells was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other immunosuppressive approaches including high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, high-dose immunoglobulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> had been ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that, in selected cases, an immunologic mechanism may mediate cytopenia in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, it demonstrates that successful mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells can be induced with high-dose cyclo in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
