<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They play an important role in the control of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human CHK2 is a homolog of the yeast G(2) checkpoint kinases known as CDS1 and RAD53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CHK2 may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene because it was found to be mutated in some individuals with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, non-mutated p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a mutational analysis of the CHK2 gene using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in 41 bone marrow samples from individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 41 samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a novel G to C transversion resulting in a change from Ala to Gly at codon 507 of CHK2 in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> sample, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells from this individual did not have the abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated a previously described polymorphism at codon 84 (A to G at nucleotide 252) of exon 1 of CHK2 in three of 41 MDS and three of 41 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of a CHK2 mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> highlights the importance of alterations of cell cycle checkpoint genes in this disease </plain></SENT>
