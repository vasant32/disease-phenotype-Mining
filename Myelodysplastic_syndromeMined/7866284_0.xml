<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the statistical risk is significant, only a minority of the patients will be so affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed peripheral blood counts of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) treated in the Departments of Hematology at the Edith Wolfson and Chaim Sheba Medical Centers, Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Included were only those who went into a complete remission and remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> free for extended periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and 36 with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups peripheral blood counts at diagnosis were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prolonged follow-up (&gt; 4 y), during which no further treatment was given, revealed a sustained increment over time of MCV (delta MCV) both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients was also evident. delta MCV was larger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference at the end of the follow-up period was as follows: 10.1 fl + 11.8 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> vs 5.0 fl + 6.2 in NHL, (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> correlation between the MCV and levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was seen at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The change in MCV was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups, its magnitude increasing from radiotherapy to chemotherapy to combined radio chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This trend is in analogy to the risk of secondary AL which is lower in NHL vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is lowest post radiotherapy and highest when both treatment modalities are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
