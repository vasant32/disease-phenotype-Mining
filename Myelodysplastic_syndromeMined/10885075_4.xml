<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method for the speciation of zinc and copper binding with proteins in human serum was explored by chelating resin (Chelex-100) pre-treatment and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown by a SEC (size-exclusion chromatography)-ICP-MS system that albumin-zinc and albumin-copper (loosely-bound species) could be selectively removed from serum by adsorption on the Chelex-100 resin after the chelating resin pre-treatment, while alpha 2-macroglobulin-zinc and ceruloplasmin-copper (firmly-bound species) remained in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The zinc and copper bound with alpha 2-macroglobulin and ceruloplasmin, respectively, were then determined by ICP-MS after batch treatment of the serum samples with the Chelex-100 resin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the total concentrations of zinc and copper were also determined by ICP-MS after a 20-fold dilution with 0.1 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25942">HNO3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The albumin-zinc and -copper were estimated as the differences between the concentrations of total and firmly-bound species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present batch pre-treatment method was applied to the speciation analysis of zinc and copper binding with proteins in sera donated from 25 healthy volunteers as well as from a pregnant woman and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed concentrations of alpha 2-macroglobulin-zinc and ceruloplasmin-copper were in the ranges 109-202 ng ml-1 (12.4-31.3% of total zinc) and 513-880 ng ml-1 (90.6-99.7% of total copper), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present method is simple (only addition of the chelating resin and centrifugation is required) and reproducible (average RSD = 2% for alpha 2-macroglobulin-zinc and 1% for ceruloplasmin-copper in intra-assay measurements, and 5% for alpha 2-macroglobulin-zinc and 4% for ceruloplasmin-copper in inter-assay measurements), and there is less risk of contamination during separation </plain></SENT>
