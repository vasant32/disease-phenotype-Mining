<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: c-mpl, the human homolog of v-mpl, is the receptor for thrombopoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that c-mpl expression carries an adverse prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and given the prognostic significance of expression of other growth factor receptors in other diseases, we attempted to determine whether c-mp/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is a prognostic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed bone marrow samples from 45 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Samples from 27 patients (60%) expressed c-mpl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (c-mpl+); their clinical and laboratory features were compared with those of the 18 patients without detectable levels of c-mpl(c-mpl-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in age, sex, leukocyte count, French-American-British subtype, or karyotype group were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>c-mpl+ patients more commonly had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> (41% v 11%; P = .046) and more commonly expressed CD34 (67% v 12%; P = .0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in complete remission (CR) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, c-mpl+ patients had shorter CR durations (P = .008; median, 6.0 v &gt; 17.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was true when only de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were considered and when controlling for age, cytogenetics, or CD34 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward shorter survival in c-mpl+ patients (P = .058; median, 7.8 v 9.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that c-mpl expression is an adverse prognostic factor for treatment outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220615" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult AML</z:e> that must be considered in the analysis of clinical studies using thrombopoietin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
