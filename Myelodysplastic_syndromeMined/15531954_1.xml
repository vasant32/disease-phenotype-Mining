<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and pathological data of 43 MDS patients over a 3-year period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected published studies for comparison were identified from MEDLINE search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were followed up for a median duration of 175 days (range, 2 to 1044 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) has not been reached, but that for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) was 250 days, 49 days and 44 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival for the low-risk and intermediate-1 IPSS categories has not been reached, while that for the intermediate-2 and high-risk categories was 58 days and 49 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival analyses, according to the FAB classification and IPSS system, were statistically significant (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our data with those from neighbouring and Western countries revealed both similarity and disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also noted different cytogenetic information in our cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found distinctly unique cytogenetic and clinico-pathological characteristics in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, whether true biological differences exist among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in different geographies and populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds require further large multinational study </plain></SENT>
