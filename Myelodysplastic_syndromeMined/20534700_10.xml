<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Usefulness of iron chelation therapy in myelodysplastic patients is still under debate but many authors suggest its possible role in improving survival of low-risk myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have described an unexpected effect of iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi>, such as an improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> induces a similar improvement more rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB is a key regulator of many cellular processes and its impaired activity has been described in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> activity on nuclear factor-kappaB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> as a possible mechanism involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> improvement during in vivo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty peripheral blood samples collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients were incubated with 50 muM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> for 18h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nuclear factor-kappaB activity dramatically decreased in samples showing high basal activity as well as in cell lines, whereas no similar behavior was observed with other iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> despite a similar reduction in reactive oxygen species levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ferric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38774">hydroxyquinoline</z:chebi> incubation did not decrease <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> activity in K562 cells suggesting the mechanism of action of the drug is independent from cell iron deprivation by chelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, incubation with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> induced an increase in K562 apoptotic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> is not seen from other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> and is iron and reactive oxygen species scavenging independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could explain the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> improvement after in vivo treatment, such that our hypothesis needs to be validated in further prospective studies </plain></SENT>
