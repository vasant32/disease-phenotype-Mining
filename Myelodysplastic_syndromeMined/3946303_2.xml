<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They examined bone marrows from 97 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> who were divided into five marrow morphologic groups: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease; (3) abnormal sideroblasts; (4) ring sideroblasts; and (5) other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tests of peripheral blood included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, hematocrit, red blood cell count and red blood cell indices, reticulocyte count, sedimentation rate or zetacrit, ferritin, iron, iron binding capacity, free erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi>, and tests of hepatic and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and logistic discriminant analysis were used to derive a graph of serum ferritin with the sedimentation rate, allowing accurate confirmation or exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percent saturation of serum transferrin and serum ferritin allowed identification of only 50 percent of patients with abnormal or ring sideroblasts while excluding 100 percent of patients without abnormal or ring sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three years of follow-up, two of 19 patients with abnormal or ring sideroblast have developed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndrome</z:e> or ANLL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the aid of the two parameter graphs described, the authors believe the differential diagnosis of the hypoproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> relating to iron metabolism can frequently be made without examination of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
