<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the recent years, many drugs have been proposed for its treatment which have had paradoxical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the antipruritus effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6993">montelukast sodium</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49159">leukotriene receptor antagonist</z:chebi>, in patients on hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted as randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 5 hemodialysis centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> were selected and were divided into 2 groups to receive firstly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50730">montelukast</z:chebi> and then placebo, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50730">montelukast</z:chebi> tablets, 10 mg daily, for 20 days and the washout period was 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 16 patients whom were included in the study, 1 died during the placebo period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and another patient who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50730">montelukast</z:chebi> for 20 days faced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> decrease during the placebo period diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50730">montelukast</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> was reduced by 35% (95% CI, 9.5% to 62.5%), while it was reduced 7% (95% CI, 0.5% to 15.9%) with placebo (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients' compliance was assessed satisfactory, except for 1 patient who exited the study due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50730">Montelukast</z:chebi> is more effective than placebo in the treatment of uremic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> not responding to the currently available antipruritus drugs, and it can be considered as a new and rather safe and effective treatment option in uremic patients </plain></SENT>
