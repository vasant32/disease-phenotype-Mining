<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the results of conventional karyotype analysis could be confirmed by one- or two-color CISS hybridization using the appropriate chromosome-specific libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that CISS hybridization can detect both numerical and structural chromosome changes in immunologically classified cells with high specificity and reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fact that chromosome spreads of very poor quality can now be included in such analyses is a decisive advantage of this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the suitability of this approach for interphase cytogenetics is discussed </plain></SENT>
