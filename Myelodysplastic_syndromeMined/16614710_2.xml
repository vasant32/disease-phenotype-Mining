<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precise diagnosis of the main forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> according to FAB classification and new WHO classification and comparison of these data with that in the general population will be helpful in estimating the relative contribution of the radiation factor to the overall incidence of such pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data on 218 consecutive cases of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in Chernobyl clean-up workers diagnosed in 1996-2005 are given in comparison with the data of 2697 consecutive patients of general population of the same age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytochemistry of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical techniques (APAAP, LSAB-AP) and the broad panel of monoclonal antibodies to lineage specific and differentiation antigens of leukocytes were employed for immunophenotyping leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Various types of oncohematological diseases developing 10-20 years after Chernobyl accident were registered in a group of clean-up workers under study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> of B and T cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> percentage among patients of clean-up workers group tended to exceed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> percentage in the group of patients representing the general population examined at the same period (4.58 vs. 3.70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 34 AML cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was preceded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> to the total number of clean-up workers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was higher than the corresponding percentage value in general population examined at the same period (9.17 vs. 6.59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B-CLL was a predominant form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> in clean-up workers under study (25.68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, B-CLL percentage in patients of clean-up workers group did not differ significantly from that in the patients of general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> percentage (7.79%) in the group of patients belonging to clean-up workers in our study turned out to be twice as much as in the patients of general population (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The verified diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue according to modern classification (EGIL, WHO) could be the prerequisite for further molecular genetic and analytical epidemiology study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that may be related to Chernobyl <z:chebi fb="33" ids="7468">NPP</z:chebi> accident consequences </plain></SENT>
