<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 41 cases, the presence of the NRAS mutation was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of chromosomal abnormalities and NRAS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 67 years (18-88 years), and the French-American-British classification was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> 26, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells 15, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells in transformation 3, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed for the patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 35), an abnormal (n = 25) karyotype and with a single (n = 15) or multiple (n = 10) cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 25 of the 60 patients (41.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these patients had a single and 10 had two or more lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (33.1 months) and with an abnormal (36.5 months) karyotype was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple lesions had a reduced median survival compared with patients with single anomalies (19.2 versus 39.7 months, p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an abnormal karyotype progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> more frequently compared with patients without lesions (36 versus 28.6%, p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NRAS mutation was detected in 2 of 10 CMMoL patients studied and in none of the 31 patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Marrow blasts more than 10% significantly affected survival </plain></SENT>
