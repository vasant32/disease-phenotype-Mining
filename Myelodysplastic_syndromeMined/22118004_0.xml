<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell distribution width and absolute lymphocyte and reticulocyte counts were significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AA was diagnosed in 54.2% of patients using a single bone marrow aspirate smear plus peripheral haemogram results, and in 95.1% using an additional bone marrow biopsy; 4.9% required multiple-site bone marrow examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities occurred in 3.9% and 31.8% of patients with AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe AA, 12.0% received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA; effectiveness rate 77.8%; 5-year survival 74.1%), 45.3% received CSA + <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy (effectiveness rate 58.8%; 5-year survival 76.5%) and 26.7% received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> monotherapy (effectiveness rate 25.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors indicated that therapy regimen and blood platelet count affected survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood smears, bone marrow spicule classification and biopsy are important diagnostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standardization of evidence-based therapy and promotion of ATG + CSA would improve general therapeutic effects in AA </plain></SENT>
