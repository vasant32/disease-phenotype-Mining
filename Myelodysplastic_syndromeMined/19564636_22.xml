<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This phase 3 prospective randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and long-term safety of erythropoietin (EPO) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus supportive care (SC; n = 53) versus SC alone (n = 57) for the treatment of anemic patients with lower-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response rates in the EPO versus SC alone arms were 36% versus 9.6%, respectively, at the initial treatment step, 47% in the EPO arm, including subsequent steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responding patients had significantly lower serum EPO levels (45% vs 5% responses for levels &lt; 200 mU/mL vs &gt; or = 200 mU/mL) and improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With prolonged follow-up (median, 5.8 years), no differences were found in overall survival of patients in the EPO versus SC arms (median, 3.1 vs 2.6 years) or in the incidence of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (7.5% and 10.5% patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased survival was demonstrated for erythroid responders versus nonresponders (median, 5.5 vs 2.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>(+) CD34(+) marrow blasts was positively correlated with longer overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with SC alone, patients receiving EPO with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus SC had improved erythroid responses, similar survival, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
