<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: (1) The percentage of 13 cases with refractory monolineage cytopenia were 5.9% of the total 219 MDS patients in the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) The median time of patients with monlineage cytopenia to M DS diagnosed was 48.5 +/- 55.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median times from monolineage cytopenia to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002875'>erythrocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were 12.5 +/- 9.5 months, 53.8 +/- 54.6 months and 59.2 +/- 65.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) The common characteristics of 13 cases were as follows: (a) the macrocytic erythrocytes in peripheral blood and the percentage of intermediate and late erythroblast in bone marrow were increased; (b) occasionally few cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> could be found; (c) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002875'>erythrocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> transformed to RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> while the most of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> subtype; (d) autoantibody could be found in part of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that some of refractory monolineage cytopenias in essence are the early states of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
