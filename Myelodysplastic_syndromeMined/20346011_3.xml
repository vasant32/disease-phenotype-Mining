<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that GvHD correlated with higher numbers of effector CD4 T cells and Natural Killer cells early after allogeneic transplantation using a regimen comprising fludarabine, busulphan and alemtuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed immune cell subset recovery in these patients in the context of early myeloid malignant disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the close relationship between the GvL and GvHD immune responses, rapid recovery of lymphocyte subsets was not associated with protection from disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that GvL may be weak in this treatment setting for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with low GvL activity, we previously reported that mixed T cell chimaerism had no detrimental effect on relapse in this treatment setting and instead correlated with better outcome because of reduced GvHD incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now report that patients with significantly higher lymphocyte numbers prior to transplantation subsequently maintained the mixed T cell chimaeric state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pre-transplant profile, together with absence of the early post-transplant signature indicative of GvHD predisposition, could potentially be used to identify patients suitable for early withdrawal of immunosuppression and prophylactic donor leucocyte infusion to boost GvL activity </plain></SENT>
