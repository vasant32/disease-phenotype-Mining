<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few reports on the global methylation status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The integration of genome-wide epigenetic regulatory marks with gene expression levels would provide additional information regarding the biological differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression and methylation status were measured using high-density microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 552 differentially methylated CpG loci were identified as being present in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; hypermethylated genes were more frequent than hypomethylated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiling identified 1005 genes that significantly differed between low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integrative analysis of the epigenetic and expression profiles revealed that 66.7% of the hypermethylated genes were underexpressed in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene network analysis revealed molecular mechanisms associated with the low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group, including altered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two key apoptotic genes BCL2 and ETS1 were identified as silenced genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immune response and micro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> biogenesis were affected by the hypermethylation and underexpression of IL27RA and DICER1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our integrative analysis revealed that aberrant epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and could have a central role in these diseases </plain></SENT>
