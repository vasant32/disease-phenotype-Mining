<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical efficacy of transfusion of frozen-thawed (FT) red cells using a 5-bag system for freezing (at -20 degrees C to -25 degrees C), storage and reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, controlled, non-randomised clinical trial was undertaken with two groups of orthopaedic surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received FT homologous blood and a control group of 10 patients received homologous blood stored in liquid form at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five transfusion-dependent patients with medical conditions were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: Thirty-three FT units were transfused without incident to 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to clinical assessment, haematological and biochemical parameters were monitored after transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical side effects and laboratory data were consistent with those after recent surgery or for pre-existing medical conditions and subsequent blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the practical side certain technical difficulties were encountered which improved with experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One of the major advantages of the system is the 35-day shelf-life at 4 degrees C after reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This system has potential for pre-deposit autologous collection, especially where large volume replacement may be required </plain></SENT>
