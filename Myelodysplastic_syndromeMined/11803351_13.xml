<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We soon observed that there seemed to be a considerable discrepancy between the reimbursement amount and the real cost of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was therefore decided to undertake a prospective micro-cost analysis to define a more realistic reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify real costs, we undertook a registration of pre-transplant procedures, transplantation and 1 year follow-up costs, including harvesting, personnel costs, clinical and laboratory procedures, together with blood products and drugs related to patients and donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were compared to hospital DRG reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This information was registered for 17 consecutive patients, with a mean age 40 years (range 17-58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data analysis showed a mean cost of US$ 106825 (NOK 901982), (range US$ 42376-362430) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average actual hospital revenue (50% DRG reimbursement + income related to length of stay + special procedure funding) was US$ 36404 (range US$ 26228-55998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activity-based financing as applied in Norway, under-compensates hospital costs for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The government should make realistic estimates of real costs before introducing financial reforms in the health care system </plain></SENT>
