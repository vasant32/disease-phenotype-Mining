<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the "in vivo" effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> and low dose Ara-C in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as to establish "in vitro" advantage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> dose-related growth pattern on bone marrow cultures as defined by culture timing and CFU-GM proliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 28 patients diagnosed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to FAB classification, of whom 4 cases had RA, 8 cases SRA, 14 cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and 2 cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who had RA and SRA were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> at doses of 20-40 mg daily for 4 months and those cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> had subcutaneous Ara-C at doses of 3 mg/m2 twice a day for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "in vivo" and "in vitro" effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> on the haemopoietic differentiation was evaluated by the growth CFU-GM in semisolid cell culture methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing in vitro concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> did not enhance the growth of myelodysplastic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our study did not find any beneficial therapeutic effect of retinoic compounds in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, low-dose Ara-C (3 mg/m2) showed similar effects when compared with higher doses reported by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in terms of CFU-GM proliferation the concentration of colonies before and after treatment were fairly similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results drawn from our study demonstrated that there is no beneficial advantage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> as a differentiation inducing agent on myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lower doses of Ara-C showed similar effects on haemopoiesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than standard doses of 10-20 mg/m2 but with less side effects </plain></SENT>
