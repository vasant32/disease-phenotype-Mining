<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The Microarray Innovations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> study assessed the clinical utility of gene expression profiling as a single test to subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> into conventional categories of myeloid and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The investigation was performed in 11 laboratories across three continents and included 3,334 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An exploratory retrospective stage I study was designed for biomarker discovery and generated whole-genome expression profiles from 2,143 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiling-based diagnostic accuracy was further validated in a prospective second study stage of an independent cohort of 1,191 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of 2,096 samples, the stage I study achieved 92.2% classification accuracy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 distinct classes investigated (median specificity of 99.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort of 1,152 prospectively collected patients, a classification scheme reached 95.6% median sensitivity and 99.8% median specificity for 14 standard subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> classes, n = 693) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 29 (57%) of 51 discrepant cases, the microarray results had outperformed routine diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiling is a robust technology for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may complement current diagnostic algorithms and could offer a reliable platform for patients who lack access to today's state-of-the-art diagnostic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our comprehensive gene expression data set will be submitted to the public domain to foster research focusing on the molecular understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
