<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal models, both graft rejection and GVHD after histoincompatible BMT can be inhibited by the posttransplantation administration of high-dose Cy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a phase I clinical trial was undertaken to determine the minimal conditioning, including posttransplantation Cy, that permits the stable engraftment of partially HLA-mismatched marrow (up to 3 HLA antigens) from first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (median age, 53 years) with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> received conditioning with fludarabine, 30 mg/m2 per day from days -6 to -2, and TBI, 2 Gy on day -1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients in cohort 1 received no additional conditioning, and 2 experienced graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients in cohort 2 received identical conditioning with the addition of Cy 14.5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sustained donor cell engraftment occurred in 8 of these patients, with a median time to absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/microL of 15 days (range, 13-16 days) and to unsupported platelet count &gt; 20,000/microL of 14 days (range, 0-26 days) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed in 6 patients (grade II in 3 patients, grade III in 3 patients) at a median of 99 days (range, 38-143 days) after transplantation and was fatal in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 191 days (range, 124-423 days), 6 of 10 patients in cohort 2 were alive, and 5 were in complete remission of their disease, including both patients with graft rejection </plain></SENT>
