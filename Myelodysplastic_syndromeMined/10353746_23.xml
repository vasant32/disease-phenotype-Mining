<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The two matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) Mr 72,000 type IV collagenase (MMP-2, gelatinase A) and Mr 92,000 type IV collagenase (MMP-9, gelatinase B) play key roles in tissue remodeling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion by digestion of extracellular matrix barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the production of these two enzymes as well as the membrane-type MMP (MT1-MMP) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 8), and healthy donors (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Zymographic analysis of BM-MNC-conditioned medium showed that a Mr 92,000 gelatinolytic activity, identified as MMP-9 by Western blotting, was constitutively released from cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and healthy individuals examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MMP-2 secretion was found to be absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples from healthy donors but present in 8 of 11 (73%) of the samples from patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 7 of 8 (88%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, and only 1 of 5 (20%) cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML in remission</z:e>, indicating MMP-2 to be produced by the leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 release was not detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cell-conditioned medium with the exception of two cases, both patients either being in or preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MMP-2 was found in three of eight (38%) of the patients, two of them undergoing progression of disease within 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative Northern blot analysis in freshly isolated BM-MNCs showed a relatively low constitutive expression of TIMP-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, whereas MMP-9 gene transcription was higher in healthy donors and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> samples, than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed the presence of TIMP-2 mRNA in the majority of MMP-2-releasing BM-MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MT1-MMP expression was present in most samples of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> but absent in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have shown that BM-MNCs continuously produce MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and demonstrated that leukemic blast cells additionally secrete MMP-2 representing a potential marker for dissemination in myeloproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
