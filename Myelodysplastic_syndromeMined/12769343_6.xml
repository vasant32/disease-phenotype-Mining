<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to provide additive clinico-hematologic information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 146 sequential patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and evaluated their clinical features at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 13/146 (8.9%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showing isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were male predominant (10:3) and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> after reassessment of marrow findings, however, two of them had an initial diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukemic transformation was rarely noted (1/13 patients), but 1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic study demonstrated that 3 patients had del(20q), 2 had t(1;7)(q10;p10), and 5 showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prominent morphologic feature in the megakaryocytes was the presence of micromegakaryocytes (5/13) and 8/13 had hypogranulated neutrophils, whereas pseudo-Pelger nuclear anomaly was rarely detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note is that 7/13 patients had an <z:mp ids='MP_0008254'>increased number of megakaryocytes</z:mp> in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients survived for more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and most of them had a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> have been mistakenly diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, since approximately 50% of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> had an <z:mp ids='MP_0008254'>increased number of megakaryocytes</z:mp> with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, careful attention to differential diagnosis is recommended for these patients </plain></SENT>
