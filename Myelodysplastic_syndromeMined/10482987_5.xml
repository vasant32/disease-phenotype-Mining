<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cosmid probes (RB, D13S319 and D13S25) hybridizing to sequences on 13q14 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> (82.4%) exhibited allelic loss at the RB, D13S319 and D13S25 locus, whereas only three of the 12 patients with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (25.0%) exhibited loss within these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six, two and one of the remaining nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients had breakpoints centromeric to the RB gene, telomeric to D13S25 and within the D13S319 locus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high frequency of allelic loss was found using these probes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, compared to in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the lymphoid origin, except CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that loss of the RB gene itself or a region between RB and D13S319, which includes commonly deleted loci, may play an important role in myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
