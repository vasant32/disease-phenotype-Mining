<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">sodium valproate</z:chebi> (VPA) on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cell line MUTZ-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, apoptotic morphological features were observed by light microscopy and transmission electronmicroscopy, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle shift were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that VPA could inhibit the growth of MUTZ-1 cells in dose-and time-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The typical apoptotic morphological features appeared in MUTZ-1 cells treated with 4 mmol/L VPA for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pyknosis of cells and nuclei, disintegration of nuclear chromatin and apoptotic body could be observed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aggregation and margination of nuclear chromatin, concentration of plasm, increment of density and chromatin mass of irregular size could be observed by transmission electronmicroscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometric analysis indicated that the VPA could induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate increased in dose-dependent manner, ratio of cells at G(0)/G(1) phase increased and ratio of cells at S phase decreased in dose-dependent manner, the cells were arrested at G(0)/G(1) phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the VPA can induce apotosis and inhibite proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells via arresting cells at G(0)/G(1) phase </plain></SENT>
