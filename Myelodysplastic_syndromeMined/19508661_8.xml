<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Clinical trial data indicate that posaconazole is superior to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (ITRA) in preventing invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (IFIs) among neutropenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> or ITRA for prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used modeling techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of experiencing an IFI, IFI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes over 100 days of follow-up were estimated from clinical trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Posaconazole is associated with fewer IFIs per patient (0.05 vs. 0.11) relative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> or ITRA over 100 days of follow-up, and lower discounted costs ($3900 vs. $4500) and increased life-years (2.50 vs. 2.43 discounted) over a lifetime horizon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 73% probability that posaconazole is cost saving versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> or ITRA and a 96% probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for posaconazole is at or below $50,000 per life-year saved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that posaconazole is very likely to be a cost-effective alternative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and may result in cost savings </plain></SENT>
