<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here on a 68-year-old male diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of his bone marrow biopsy at initial clinical presentation and in subsequent studies revealed the presence of two abnormal clones, 92,XXYY and 92,XXYY,del(5)(q13q33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of abnormal cells confirmed interstitial deletion in 5q, demonstrated predominance of the tetraploid clone and persistent presence of the tetraploid clone with 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was not responsive to Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment, which is routinely used in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a subsequent course of therapy with the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-transferase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> resulted in clinical and cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the unique complex abnormality of tetraploidy and 5q deletion described here for the first time in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is characterized by distinct disease etiology, the mechanism of which could involve epigenetic inactivation of gene expression via methylation </plain></SENT>
