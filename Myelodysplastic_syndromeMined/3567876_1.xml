<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) subtypes <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RA-S) (26 and eight patients, respectively) were investigated for clinical and morphologic significance of the most frequently occurring minor chromosome deletions [del(17)(p12), del(8)(p22), del(2)(p24), and del(9)(p22)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of 17p- was statistically significantly related to a low initial bone marrow cellularity (p = 0.01) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of RA was seen more frequently among patients with 17p-, also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>17p- alone was not related to progression to RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of 8p- was statistically significantly related to a higher initial frequency of bone marrow myeloblasts (p = 0.05), but not to bone marrow cellularity or initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>8p- alone was not related to initial diagnosis, but a statistically significant relation to progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> was found (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2p- was related to progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, also (p = 0.02), but not to any of the other investigated parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant relations between the occurrence of 9p- and other parameters were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of 17p- and 8p- was also statistically significantly related to progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These relationships suggest that 17p- is involved in the development of bone marrow and peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and that 8p-, and possibly 2p-, interferes with differentiation of primitive granulocyte precursors and, thus, play a part in the process leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
