<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cooperative group associated members of 37 university centers spread throughout France; these centers handle the overwhelming majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classified according to FAB guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two thousand four hundred ninety-nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> were recorded, with similar total recruitment and distribution by cytologic subclass for both years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemogram data analysis revealed significant differences between different classes for certain parameters, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) secondary to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 145) were unclassifiable according to the French-American-British (FAB) system than the de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> (n = 1954) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred twenty cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their frequency was underestimated due to optional reporting during the first year and the less favorable position of the university centers for recruiting these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the hemograms were established for acquired idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 107), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) (n = 329), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 129) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (n = 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the 1177 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) recorded showed good stability from one year to the next in terms of numbers of cases and distribution in the subclasses L1, L2, and L3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution among these three subclasses by age also was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For L1 and L2 the hemogram data were examined separately for adults and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study of 74 cases of type L3 ALL enabled us to detail the hematologic presentation of this rare form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
