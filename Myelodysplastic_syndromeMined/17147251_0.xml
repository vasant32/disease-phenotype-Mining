<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA corresponding to exon 12 of NPM gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 40 AML patients (28 case untreated and 12 in first remission) and 33 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PCR products were purified and screened by direct sequencing, the mutation PCR products were cloned into pUCm-T vector and then transfected into E. coil DH5alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 5 recombinant colonies were selected, and plasmid DNA were prepared and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NPM mutations were found in 6 patients (4 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 2 MDS): 4 were type A,1 type B, and 1 novel sequence variant ( named as type R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A new type of NPM mutation was found, and NPM mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were demonstrated for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results provides new hints for NPM gene mutations in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
