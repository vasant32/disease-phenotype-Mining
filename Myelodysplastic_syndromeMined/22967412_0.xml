<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and nineteen primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier method, Log-rank test and COX regression model were used to evaluate factors that influence the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six cases (61.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (PLT &lt; 100×10(9)/L), one hundred and three cases (24.6%) had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (PLT &lt; 30×10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) tended to shorten along with the decreasing of platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis indicated that PL &lt; 30×10(9)/L, MCV ≤ 95 fl, LDH ≥ 300 U/L, lymphocyte-like micromegakaryocyte, nucleated RBC <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> positive, IPSS cytogenetic intermediate- and poor-risk were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> related with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-Ior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-IIwas poorer than that of the other subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these parameters, PLT &lt; 30×10(9)/L, MCV ≤ 95 fl, IPSS cytogenetic intermediate- and poor-risk group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> had independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modified WPSS prognostic model was proposed by adopting PLT, MCV, chromosomal karyotype and WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The OS of patients with low risk, intermediate-1 risk, intermediate-2 risk and high risk were 59, 28, 14 and 4 months, respectively, and there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> indicated unfavorable prognosis, in combination with MCV, chromosomal karyotype and WHO classification, a modified WPSS prognostic model was proposed and worked well for prognostic indication in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
