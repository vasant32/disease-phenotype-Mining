<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NK cell alloreactivity after allogeneic HSCT is regulated by killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the influence of KIRs on outcome after unrelated HSCT, we retrospectively analyzed the HLA and KIR genotypes of 116 donor-recipient pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that missing KIR ligands in recipients were significantly associated with a decreased leukemic relapse risk (P=0.019, HR=0.329), mainly in myeloid disease (P=0.003, HR=0.193) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This beneficial effect was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In myeloid disease, missing KIR ligands also improved 5-year OS (P=0.034, HR=0.430) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.024, HR=0.445) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the presence of donor-activating KIR2DS3 gene was associated with increased relapse risk (P=0.003, HR=5.046), decreased OS (P=0.004, HR=3.181) and DFS (P=0.003, HR=2.919) in myeloid disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect was seen in patients with lymphoid disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that, in unrelated HSCT for myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, missing KIR ligands in recipients offered a lower relapse risk and a long-term survival advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of KIR2DS3 in the donor was an important risk factor for myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
