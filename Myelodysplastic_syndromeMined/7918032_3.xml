<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clonal haemopoiesis has previously been demonstrated in some 30% of patients in remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst a 'clonal remission' in many such patients may represent a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern in haemopoietic cells, its relationship to an underlying preleukaemic state remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore analysed the clonal status of 48 female patients in remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> using X-chromosome linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> PGK and HPRT genes and the DXS255 (M27 beta) locus, and carried out in conjunction a detailed study of the morphological and karyotypic features of the patients' bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During remission, 35 patients (73%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> demonstrated nonclonal haemopoiesis, and their bone marrows were morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission haemopoietic tissue in nine cases (19%) showed a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern and remission bone marrows in these patients had features of trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (TMDS), with seven having similar features at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of constitutional DNA showed a non-clonal pattern in seven of these patients, but was unsuccessful in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These nine patients with post-chemotherapy TMDS were considered to have true clonal haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (8%) with a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> remission bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of constitutional DNA showed a skewed pattern in two of these patients, but was unsuccessful in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic investigation during remission in the nine patients with TMDS showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in four cases and the acquisition of new karyotypic abnormalities in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 10 female patients in remission of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) were shown to have non-clonal haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who achieve remission after cytoreductive chemotherapy have non-clonal haemopoiesis, and when clonal remissions are observed these are commonly associated with the development of trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow, with or without karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>True clonal remission in association with morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haemopoiesis is a rare entity, the significance and frequency of which remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
