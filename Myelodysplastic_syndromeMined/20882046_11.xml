<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This retrospective report assessed the impact of rabbit antithymocyte globulins (ATG), incorporated within a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) using human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated donors (HLA-MUD), on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients, 120 patients (70%) did not receive ATG ('no-ATG' group), whereas 51 patients received ATG ('ATG' group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 30.3 months, the cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 36% in the no-ATG group and 20% in the ATG group (P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was significantly lower in the ATG group as compared to the no-ATG group (4 vs 32%, respectively; P = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the absence of use of ATG was the strongest parameter associated with an increased risk of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (relative risk) = 7.14, 95% CI: 1.7-33.3, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, the probability of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survivals was not significantly different between the no-ATG and ATG groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the addition of ATG to GVHD prophylaxis resulted in decreased incidence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD without an increase in relapse or nonrelapse mortality, and without compromising survival after myeloablative allo-SCT from HLA-MUD </plain></SENT>
