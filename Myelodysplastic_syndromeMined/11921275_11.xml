<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment exposure was significantly different (less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> exposure, more radiotherapy-only exposure) than for patients with 11q23 (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and 21q22 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.002, respectively) abnormalities </plain></SENT>
