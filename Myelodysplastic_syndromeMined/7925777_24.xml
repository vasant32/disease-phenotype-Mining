<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the phenotype of immune effectors in the marrow of AA patients remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined severe (sAA) and moderate AA (mAA) patients and compared them to healthy volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that percentages of HLA-DR+ CD8+ lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, CD56+, were elevated in the marrow of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood (PB), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances, did not reflect changes seen in the bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased percentages of activated CD8+ cells were found in marrow and blood in 43% of AA patients, but in 28% of AA patients, activation of CD8+ cells was only detectable in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During hematopoietic recovery, activated CD8+ cells and NK cells in marrow declined, but not to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T cells bearing the gamma delta-phenotype were elevated in the blood of sAA patients (p &lt; 0.05) but were not significantly increased in BM from sAA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentages of activated immune effectors are increased in the marrow of AA patients as is consistent with a localized immune response in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marrow phenotyping may be more sensitive than peripheral blood analysis for detecting an abnormal cellular immune response </plain></SENT>
