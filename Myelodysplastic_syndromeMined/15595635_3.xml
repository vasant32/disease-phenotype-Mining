<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a retrospective study of 45 patients older than 60 years of age, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, who were diagnosed and/or treated in our clinic in the year 2001 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of them were diagnosed as de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> while 31 developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocytemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
