<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry is potentially suited to the chemosensitivity analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow subpopulations in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The use of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> 7-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15369">actinomycin</z:chebi> (7AAD) on unfixed cells to measure loss of viability at a range of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) doses was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A six-tube flow cytometric assay for measuring the sensitivity to ara-C of CD45/side-scatter-gated or of CD34-positive leukemic blasts with 7AAD was established, using fixed stained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mononuclear cells as an internal standard for quantitation of viable cells following culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7AAD dose response curves for 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) showed a wide range of sensitivities at 2.5-5 microM araC (3.7-97%, mean 54% of control cell viability at 2.5 microM and 4.1-94.6 %, mean 27% at 5 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parallel assays for ATP bioluminescence agreed reasonably well with the 7AAD method, r(s) = 0.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chemosensitivity of CD45/SSC-gated blast cells at 2.5 microM araC showed no consistent relationship with the ungated cell populations, such that CD45/SSC-gated blast sensitivity of seven samples ranged from 86% more to 38% less than that of the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the chemosensitivities of the CD34-gated subpopulations ranged from 51% more to 78% less than those of the total populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:These results emphasize the necessity of measuring the chemosensitivity of the population of interest rather than of the sample as a whole in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical material </plain></SENT>
