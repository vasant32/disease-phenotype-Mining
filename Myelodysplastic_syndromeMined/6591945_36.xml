<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aggravation of peripheral-blood cytopenia during the first weeks and hypocellularity of bone-marrow aspirates at the end of therapy suggest that low-dose Ara C exerts its main activity by suppression of leukaemic growth, rather than by induction of differentiation in malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients demonstrate that low-dose Ara C can be of value in severe cytopenia and can decrease the proportion of leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, but the danger of treatment should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
