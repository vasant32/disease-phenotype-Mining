<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present five male patients, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, in whom a new, nonrandom unbalanced dicentric t(17;20), resulting in deletions of 17p and 20q, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics showed additional karyotypic abnormalities in most of the patients, including deletions of 5q, deletions or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7, and deletions of 18q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a deletion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene TP53 on 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the four cases with follow-up data available, only two had received combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in these two cases was 6 and 7 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other patients who had no active therapy administered died 6 weeks and 9 months after diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These five cases highlight a rare but recurrent abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, potentially involving genes on 17p and 20q of importance in myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
