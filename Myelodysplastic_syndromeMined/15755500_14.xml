<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although few doubt the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> with increased risk for life-threatening events such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or the association between clonal myeloproliferation and the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, controversy exists regarding the timing and nature of appropriate therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that treatment with myelosuppressive agents such as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, radiophosphorus (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> reduces the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, investigators have also identified an increased risk of drug-related leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ideal cytoreductive treatment for long-term use should minimize <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and avoid long-term complications, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anagrelide, an imidazoquinolin, inhibits megakaryopoiesis and more selectively reduces platelet production in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of an open-label, multicenter, international trial reviewing 3660 anagrelide-treated patients was performed to assess efficacy and long-term safety, specifically potential for increased leukemogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> diagnosed according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients enrolled, 81% had previously received other myelosuppressive agents; of these, 33% were transferred from the original agent to anagrelide due to toxicity and 31% were transferred because of poor platelet control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 45% of patients were symptomatic due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocythemia</z:e>, most commonly vascular sequelae (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dosage was titrated to achieve a platelet count &lt; 600 x 10(9) L(-1) and ideally between 130 and 450 x 10(9) L(-1) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the Safety Population, 12.8% (467/3660) of patients were treated with anagrelide as the sole cytoreductive agent (naive patients) </plain></SENT>
