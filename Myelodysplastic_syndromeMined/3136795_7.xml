<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nine out of 13 responders to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cultured T-cells obtained prior to therapy, as well as their conditioned medium strongly suppressed both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allogeneic and autologous CFU-GM (the latter obtained after marrow recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Addition of anti-interferon-gamma to the cultures abolished the suppressive effect on CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After ATG therapy, no similar inhibitory effect was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Employing the panning method with monoclonal antibodies (CD4+ for inducer/helper and CD8+ for cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells) we were able to show that the cells responsible for in vitro CFU-GM inhibition were included in the cytotoxic/suppressor T-cell subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultured T-cells and their conditioned medium obtained from 14 non-responders to ATG did not show CFU-GM suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean interferon (IFN) levels in the T-cell conditioned media of ATG-responders was 625 +/- 125 mu/ml while in non-responders the level was 45 +/- 15 mu/ml (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control levels 43 +/- 24 mu/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from either group did not show any in vitro inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response rate to ATG was statistically significant when the generation in culture of high versus low IFN production was compared (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experiments with T-cells obtained from heavily transfused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472759,C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia major</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, also did not demonstrate any suppression of CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the response rate to ATG is significantly higher in patients with AA who have an abnormal regulation of interferon-gamma (g-IFN) production </plain></SENT>
