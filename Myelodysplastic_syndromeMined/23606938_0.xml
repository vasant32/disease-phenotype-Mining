<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For decades, the mainstay of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was supportive care, including transfusion of blood products and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further understanding of disease biology led to the discovery of a high prevalence of hypermethylation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, the role of irreversible DNA methlytransferase inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was investigated with promising outcomes in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was initially approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and was granted expanded approval in 2009 to reflect new overall survival data demonstrated in the AZA-001 study of patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of survival in higher-risk patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and has changed the natural history of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The agent maintains a relatively safe toxicity profile, even in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> has been explored in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and has also been studied in the peritransplant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> has been combined with other novel agents such as lenalidomide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors and growth factors in the hope of achieving improved outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently, both intravenous and subcutaneous forms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> are approved for use in the USA with the oral form being granted fast track status by the FDA </plain></SENT>
