<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, data on patients with B-cell NHL who were treated with two courses of ibritumomab tiuxetan were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen such patients were analyzed (age: 58 years, 48 - 91), with a median of four prior regimens (1 - 7), stem cell transplantation (n = 5), and radiation therapy (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the first course, G3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was 35% and 41%; overall response rate (ORR) was 89%; time between courses was 16.6 months (6.0 - 42.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the second course, the incidence of G3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was 28% and 44%; and ORR 77% </plain></SENT>
