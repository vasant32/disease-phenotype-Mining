<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytogenetics analysis of bone marrow cells was performed by direct method and/or 24 h culture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was analysed by R banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 50 MDS patients, 22 were found with abnormal karyotype: two of them were +8, four of them were -7, four of them were 5q-, nine of them were 7q-, two of them were 20q- and one of them was 6q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are six patients had complex changes in chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 5q-, -7, 7q- are the most classic translocation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with 5q- have better prognosis and the patients with -7, 7q- have worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics is very important in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>'s diagnosis, progress and prognosis </plain></SENT>
