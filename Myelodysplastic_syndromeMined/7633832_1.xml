<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It usually appears 23 months following transplantation and is associated with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in our T-lymphocyte depleted allogeneic BMT recipients, transplanted between 1987-1991, was 18 out of 197 (9.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients (1.5% of allogenic BMT recipients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> occurred prior to marrow engraftment, on days 12-16 post BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in contrast to 9/11 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in addition to developing CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> between engraftment and day +100 (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these three patients did not receive steroid therapy as opposed to 14/15 patients who were treated with steroids and eventually contracted CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> post-engraftment (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three patients did not have two additional risk factors known for the development of CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>: increasing age and a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite prompt diagnosis and therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> and high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), two of the patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tcell depleted BMT may be a risk factor for development of CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> occurring prior to engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the era of post-BMT anti CMV prophylaxis, one should be aware that life-threatening CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> may appear prior to engraftment and consider aggressive CMV prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
