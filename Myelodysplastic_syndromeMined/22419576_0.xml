<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> family and suppresses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survivin also functions as a subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex for regulating mitosis with Aurora-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survivin and Aurora-B play an important role in maintaining genome stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the role of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase in disease progression and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression levels of these two genes in CD34(+) cells prepared from 64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or leukemic blasts from 50 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> using quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survivin and Aurora-B expression levels were highly correlated with the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, were much higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-2, and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, and increased during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between these expression levels and the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these levels were remarkably higher in patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> than in those with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing that high levels of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase expression in CD34(+) cells are distinctive molecular features of high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Marked upregulation of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase may contribute to genetic instability and disease progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data may explain why patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> frequently show complex chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
