<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfusions of red blood cells and platelets comprise the basis of supportive care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, haemopoietic growth factors can enhance: proliferation and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and myelodysplastic haemopoietic progenitor cells, and prevent premature apoptosisacceleration of haemopoietic recovery after intensive chemotherapy and amelioration of mature cell function; and sensitisation of malignant cells for the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is widespread clinical experience with the use of epoetin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of 17 trials with EPO showed a stimulation of erythropoiesis, resulting in a discontinuation of the need for transfusions or an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of at least 15 g/L in 16% of 205 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Favourable factors for the response were an initial absence of a need for transfusion and a serum EPO level &lt;200 U/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In clinical phase I/II studies of GM-CSF administration, a dose-dependent increase in the absolute neutrophil count was seen in &gt;80% of patients, as well as a decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect on survival could not be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower platelet counts, with a risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, local <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> at the subcutaneous injection site and <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> during intravenous infusion, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined administration of GM-CSF and EPO to a small number of patients resulted in an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels or a decrease in the need for transfusion, with an overall response rate of 46%, but is not a proven treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of G-CSF increased the absolute neutrophil count in about 90% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and was accompanied by an improvement of neutrophil function, which is frequently impaired in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, contradictory data exist on the influence of prophylactic G-CSF treatment on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Synergism of G-CSF and EPO has not yet been proven in randomised phase III trials, although selected patients showing no response to EPO alone may achieve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels after receiving additional G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment in vivo with EPO, GM-CSF or G-CSF has not been shown to change the percentage of bone marrow cells carrying cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, individual patients have shown a reversal from a monoclonal to a polyclonal pattern with GM-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
