<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether variations in fat tissue fraction depend on the size of individual adipocytes or their number or both, a stereologic study of 30 human bone marrow specimens (10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, 10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and 10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 23,435 adipocyte profiles were measured and two stereologic parameters were obtained in each specimen: mean diameter and number of cells per mm3 of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fat tissue fraction correlated positively with the size (r = .79; P less than .001) and the number/volume (r = .77; P less than .001) of adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significance of both adipocyte size and adipocyte number/volume was confirmed by stepwise multiple regression, in which the size alone explained 62.5% of fat tissue fraction and both size and number/volume explained 95.8% of fat tissue fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed from a pathophysiologic point of view </plain></SENT>
