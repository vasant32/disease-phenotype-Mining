<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty bone-marrow trephine biopsies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied and compared with bone marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It proved possible to make the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on the basis of bone-marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features of <z:mp ids='MP_0000245'>abnormal erythropoiesis</z:mp> and myelopoiesis, although different from those observed in smears, were easily detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, obvious advantages of bone-marrow biopsy over bone-marrow smears were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the biopsy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> gives an exact assessment of the cellularity; secondly, the presence of reticulin fibres, increased in the majority of the cases, can be evaluated; thirdly, dysmegakaryopoiesis is more easily detected in trephine biopsies than in smears; finally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852552,C0233514" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">abnormal behaviour</z:e> of myeloblasts, clustering centrally in the bone marrow, is frequently observed before the smears show an excess of myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone-marrow biopsy also has a role in difficult cases, where the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can not be established on just bone-marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The five types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as described by the FAB group, do not represent recognizable histological entities </plain></SENT>
