<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with low-dose oral 6-thioguanine (6-TG; 20 to 60 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients demonstrated significant improvement in peripheral blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional three patients had significant reductions in the percentage of leukemic myeloblasts in the marrow without a corresponding improvement in peripheral counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a fall in the peripheral neutrophil count in four patients requiring dose reductions, no toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-dose oral 6-TG gives a response rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> similar to that of parenteral agents such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the ease of administration and lack of toxicity, oral 6-TG may be a useful treatment modality for these syndromes either alone or in combination with other differentiation-enhancing agents </plain></SENT>
