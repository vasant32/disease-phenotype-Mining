<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the involvement of ETV6, with disruption of the gene consistently at its 5' end, has been reported by several groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fusion transcript between ETV6 and HLXB9 has been detected in some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, reported cases of t(7;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here a study based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of the translocation breakpoints in seven patients and detailed molecular studies using Southern blotting on two of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FISH studies have shown a cluster of breakpoints within a cosmid contig proximal to the HLXB9 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting analysis enabled us to define two distinct breakpoints within the area covered by the cosmid contig in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of an unusual case of t(7;12)(q22;p13) [full karyotype: 46,XX,der(7)t(7;12)(q22;p13)del(7)(q22q36)] also revealed a break in 7q36, although in a region proximal to the overlapping cosmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5' RACE PCR in one patient has shown a rearrangement involving the ETV6 allele not involved in the t(7;12), suggesting that no functional ETV6 allele might be present in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the distribution of breakpoints in 7q36, indicating that the generation of a fusion gene might not be the mechanism responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in the t(7;12), at least in some cases </plain></SENT>
