<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 11 of 12 (91%) patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, 3 of 11 (27%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 8 of 21 (38%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 6 of 23 (25%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and 5 of 11 (45%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probability of remaining in CR at 3 years was 82% in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, but 0% in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 7% in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 0% with ALL, and 33% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A leukocyte dose of 1 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, 3 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 1 x 10(8)/kg of recipient body weight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> appeared to be optimal as an initial dose of DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the minimal dose of leukocyte developing fatal GVHD was 7 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These suggest that a relatively small dose of DLI ranging from 1 x 10(7)/kg to 5 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight should be administered initially then the infused escalating dose 2 or 3 months later in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a large number of leukocytes around 1 x 10(8)/kg are needed to induce graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> despite a 7% fatality in GVHD </plain></SENT>
