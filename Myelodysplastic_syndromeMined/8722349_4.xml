<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that, unlike in patients submitted to allogeneic BMT, administration of recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) after autologous BMT (ABMT) had no significant effect on erythroid recovery and transfusional requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it has also been shown that combining Epo with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> resulted in additive effects on erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the effects of combined G-CSF + Epo therapy on erythroid recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation a pilot randomized, three-arm trial was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients suffering from lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> submitted to ABMT were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF alone (5 micrograms/kg, from day + 1 up to reaching an ANC &gt; or = 10(9)/1), G-CSF + Epo (150 U/kg, from day +1 to +21), or neither of these (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving G-CSF + Epo had significantly more reticulocytes on day +21 and reached 30 x 10(9)/1 reticulocytes earlier when compared to both G-CSF and control patients; however, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions was not modified by the addition of Epo to G-CSF, although both groups had significantly fewer units transfused than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No effect on platelet recovery or platelet transfusional requirements was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myeloid recovery was comparable in the G-CSF and G-CSF+Epo groups, and significantly accelerated as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the addition of Epo to G-CSF causes a slight acceleration of erythroid recovery after ABMT, but is not associated with transfusional benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present data do not support the use of Epo in association with G-CSF to hasten erythroid recovery after ABMT </plain></SENT>
