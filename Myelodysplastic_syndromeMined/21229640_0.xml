<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: to evaluate the biological and clinical implications of immunophenotypic abnormalities of bone marrow myeloid cell compartment in patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: analysis of cell surface antigen profiles was performed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping on bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNCs) specimens from 39 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 5 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of cell surface antigen profiles was correlated with FAB subtype, cytogenetics, CFU-GM colony growth, overall survival (OS) and leukemic transformation (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: expression levels of early differentiation and myelo-monocytic antigens (CD38, CD13, CD33, CD14 and CD15) on myeloid cell compartment of BMMCs were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in comparison to healthy control group, suggesting maturational left shift of bone marrow myeloid cell compartment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34 antigen expression was in a positive linear correlation with HLA-DR antigen expression (r=0.652; p=0.0004), and in negative correlation with the expression of CD11b and CD15 antigens (r=-0.48; p=0.014 and r=-0.564; p=0.0033, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myeloid antigen ratio (HLA-DR/CD11b) was 2.5 fold higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in comparison to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced disease had significantly higher myeloid antigen ratio than patients with low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The type of CFU-GM colony growth and the presence of chromosomal aberrations were unrelated to the proportion of CD34(+) cells and elevated myeloid ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with elevated proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs or elevated myeloid ratio had significantly shorter OS and higher LT rate in comparison to patients whose proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs and myeloid ratio were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the presence of abnormalities in antigen expression profiles of bone marrow myeloid cell compartment has clinical implication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with particular contribution in predicting the patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs and elevated myeloid ratio of bone marrow myeloid compartment are useful immunophenotypic tools for estimation of prognosis in this very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder group </plain></SENT>
