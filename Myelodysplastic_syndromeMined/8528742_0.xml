<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several genes located in region (5)(q23-34) have been implicated as being of pathogenic importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study seven samples of six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> who have the del(5)(q) aberration were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FMS hemizygosity was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis from peripheral blood samples confirmed the observations of this aberration found by semiquantitative Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR-based analysis can be used for primary diagnosis in addition to cytogenetic evaluation and for follow-up in patients with del(5)(q) aberration </plain></SENT>
