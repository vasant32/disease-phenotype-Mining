<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from more than 32,000 patients up to December 31, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was observed in 14 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6; 40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 7; 47%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 2; 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> developed in 9 patients during GH treatment and in 6 after the cessation of GH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, such as Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and previous radiation or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient-years of GH therapy was defined as the time from the first dose of GH to the date of the last visit during GH therapy, and patient-years of risk was defined as the time from the first dose of GH to December 31, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of patient-years of GH therapy and patient-years of risk in GH-treated patients without risk factors was 3.0/100,000 and 3.9/100,000, respectively, a figure similar to the incidence in the general population aged 0-15 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in GH-treated patients without risk factors is not greater than that in the general population aged 0-15 yr, and a possible increased occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with GH treatment appears to be limited to patients with risk factors </plain></SENT>
