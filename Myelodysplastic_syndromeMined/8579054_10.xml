<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath>, ET is associated with an increased risk of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the large majority of cases of leukemic transformation in ET are thought to be related to prior therapy, usually radioactive phosphorous or alkylating chemotherapy, and the development of AL in ET is extremely rare in the untreated patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, two cases of ET which evolved into AL without prior exposure to radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and which were treated with long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> therapy, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case had cytogenetic changes in the bone marrow suggestive of therapy-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and the second developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> on therapy which was likely chemotherapy-induced and led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prolonged used of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> in patients with ET may lead to therapy-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
