<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum albumin, cholinesterase, and cholesterol were significantly lowered by the administration of GM-CSF and recovered after the cessation of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GM-CSF impairs the biosynthesis of liver cells and that cholesterol-lowering activity of GM-CSF, which is previously reported, is due to the impairment of liver biosynthesis by GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
