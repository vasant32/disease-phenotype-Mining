<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to characterize the chromosome breakpoints in molecular terms and to determine if hemizygosity or submicroscopic deletions occur in patients without any cytogenetically detectable abnormality of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms with 10 chromosome 7-specific DNA probes in separated WBC fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No molecular abnormalities occurred in lymphocyte-derived DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several probes located in band 7q22 or distally thereof detected deletion of one allele in granulocyte-derived DNA from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with chromosome 7 long arm deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the granulocytes of one patient heterozygosity for the T cell receptor beta chain gene (in band 7q35) indicated that the deletion was interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NJ-3, a proalpha2(I)collagen gene probe (in band 7q21-22) detected heterozygosity in the granulocytes of one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No hemizygosity or deletions were found in four patients with two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that mature granulocytes but not lymphocytes are derived from the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interstitial deletions exist, and the extent of deleted genomic material varies among patients </plain></SENT>
