<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured pretreatment serum levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) at dosages up to 300 U/kg thrice weekly for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) was defined as a rise in untransfused <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations of at least 2 g/dl or a 100% decrease in RBC transfusion requirements over the treatment period; a partial response (PR) was an increase in untransfused <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> values of 1-2 g/dl or a decrease in RBC transfusion requirements equal to or greater than 50%; no response (NR) was defined as a response less than a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of rhEPO treatment, four patients showed a CR, five patients a PR, and 16 patients NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of both TNF-alpha (80.5 %/- 64.8 vs 8.1 +/- 4.2 ng/l, P &lt; 0.001) and IL-1 beta (60.4 +/- 49.9 vs 8.9 +/- 4.7 ng/l, P &lt; 0.001) were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in a group of 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders (CR + PR) showed significantly lower serum levels of TNF-alpha than non-responders (21.6 +/- 26.2 vs 106.3 +/- 60.8 ng/l, P &lt; 0.001), whereas IL-1 beta concentrations between those who benefited from therapy and unresponsive cases were not significantly different (39.8 +/- 48.9 vs 73.4 +/- 48.2 ng/l, P = 0.120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that TNF-alpha levels were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responsive patients but one, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-responders presented elevated cytokine concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta values and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, transfusion requirement, serum EPO or ferritin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pre-treatment TNF-alpha levels might help to select those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who are most likely to benefit from rhEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
