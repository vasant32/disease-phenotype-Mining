<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> were treated with 0.6-1.9 mg/m(2)/day oral topotecan for 5 consecutive days on and 2 days off, for 3 weeks (15 doses/course) followed by 2-4 weeks of rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DLTs occurring during the first course of treatment were considered for defining the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of antitumor activity were assessed by examining bone marrow status and peripheral blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 26 patients enrolled in the study were evaluable for toxicity, and 24 patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 54 courses were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported nonhematological toxicities (percentage of courses) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (57%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (50%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (24%), and mucositis (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DLTs included grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> at 1.9 mg/m(2)/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MTD for oral topotecan in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> was defined at 1.4 mg/m(2)/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicity was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> courses but was not considered dose-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four (17%) patients achieved a complete response, and six (25%) patients experienced hematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protracted administration of oral topotecan is safe and well tolerated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the dose-schedule used, single-agent oral topotecan has a definite activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and warrants further investigation alone or in combination with other agents </plain></SENT>
