<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with allogeneic SCT at a single institution treated between January 1993 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 16 consecutive children who received allogeneic SCT for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in our center, 14 patients met the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according WHO I and II criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 4.8 years (range, 1-14 years) and 64% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stage was refractory cytopenia (RC) in 9, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was present in 35% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (11/14) were conditioned with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-based myeloablative (MA) regimen with addition of low-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one received a bone marrow graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients achieved complete remission (CR), and seven remain alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 3 years (range, 2-14 years) the OS and EFS was 57% (95%CI, 0.28-0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cumulative EFS at 10 years was 43% (95% CI, 0.14-0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapse-related mortality was 21.4%; nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 28.57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the survivors had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in their conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 10 years had better survival (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> achieve encouraging OS and EFS following allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-based regimen with a lower dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> is an effective and less toxic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The outcomes are best in younger patients </plain></SENT>
