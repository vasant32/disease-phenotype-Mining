<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five adults (age 60 to 75 years; median, 67 years) with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (including therapy-related and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.3 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 100 mg/m(2) by continuous IV infusion on days 1 through 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received up to two courses of consolidation chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 2 gm/m(2) on days 1 through 5 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cohorts with escalating dose levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> were tested (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed during the first cycle of consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between cell surface expression of CD74 and clinical outcome was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of CR was 65% (62 of 95), and 4% of patients (four of 95) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients developed grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> plus Int-DAC proved tolerable at the highest dose tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower CD74 expression was associated with CR/CRp (P = .04) but not with disease-free or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> to standard 3 + 7 daunorubicin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> induction chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> resulted in an encouraging remission rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The maximum tested dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> administered in combination with Int-DAC for remission consolidation was 1.3 mg/m(2) and proved tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further testing of this regimen is planned </plain></SENT>
