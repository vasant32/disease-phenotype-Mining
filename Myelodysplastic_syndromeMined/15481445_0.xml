<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is not present in most hematologic textbooks, but clinically the disease does exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the past 13 years, 34 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (+8) and previous diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were followed and studied in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had been given cytotoxic drugs before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> became apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (52.9%) had a history of 3 months to more than 20 years before cytogenetic detection of +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of blood cell counts were seen in 1 to 3 cell lines, with a median blast cell percentage in the bone marrow of 8% (range, 5%-19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up period of 21.5 months (range, 3-129 months), the median overall survival time was 20 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients with +8, including the patients with chromosome abnormalities in addition to +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with +8 only, 11 (45.8%) of the 24 patients developed frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 9 of these 11 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results showed that this group of +8 patients had multilineage abnormalities in blood cell counts and increased numbers of blasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diseases of these patients manifested an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003587'>insidious onset</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> but progressive clinical course, and they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had cytogenetic clonal changes with +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These facts suggest that this group of +8 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had evidence of a leukemic clone, and their conditions might conform to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
