<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (2, class 1) in the alloPBSCT group and seven patients (2, class 1) in the BM group had one HLA locus mismatch donor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following factors were matched: HLA-compatibility, diagnosis, disease stage, age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age in the PBSC group was 37 years (19-56, excluding one 6-year-old child) and in the BM group 37 years (18-53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BM group consisted of 12 females and 25 males, 17 females and 20 males were in the PBSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients in the BM and 11 patients in the PBSC group were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>,; 7/7, ALL; 15/15, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; 2/3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 1/1, NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (14/20) of the 74 patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was BU/CY for standard risk patients with myeloid diseases (31 patients) and TBI/CY for ALL and NHL patients (36 patients); six patients received intensified conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> (2 patients), thiotepa (2 patients) or melphalan (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GVHD prophylaxis regimen was used according to the Seattle protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DFS was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days, in PBSC and BM transplants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to leukocyte engraftment in PBSC patients was 14 days (range 6-26 days) and in the BM group 19 days (range 9-29 days; P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 40% (four patients died, 13%) in the PBSC group and 20)% (three patients died, 8%) in the BM group, respectively (P &lt; 0.05, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No signs of aGVHD were found in 19% of the patients in the PBSC and 27% in the BM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT does lead to a significantly faster leukocyte engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The significant increase with regard to the incidence and shorter time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe aGVHD in PBSC patients, compared to marrow transplant patients, need to be confirmed in a randomised trial </plain></SENT>
