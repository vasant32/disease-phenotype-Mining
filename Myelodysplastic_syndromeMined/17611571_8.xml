<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, outcome of 593 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML after autologous and allogeneic HCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 167 (28%) patients received HCT from MUD without prior chemotherapy (MUD-U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rest received HCT in first complete remission (CR1) (Autologous (Auto-CR1), n=290 (49%), HCT from MUD (MUD-CR1), n=136 (23%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival at 3 years was best in MUD-CR1 (50%) compared to Auto-CR1 (41%) and MUD-U (40%) (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, disease-free survival was 44% for MUD-CR1 compared to Auto-CR1 (28%) and MUD-U (34%) (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse for Auto-CR1 was 62% compared to 24 and 30% for MUD-CR1 and MUD-U, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was best for patients with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden transplanted 6-12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing outcome at 3 years were mainly significant in the first 6 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcomes after allogeneic HCT in patients of 20-40 and &gt;40 years were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autologous and Allogeneic HCT from MUD offer the possibility of long-term survival to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML </plain></SENT>
