<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the production of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> and examined the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> who have received blood transfusion frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA antibodies were detected by anti-human globulin lymphocyte cytotoxicity test (AHG-LCT), and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> by flow cytometry and mixed passive hemagglutination test (MPHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A leukocyte removal filter was used for preventing production of alloantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The leukocytes in blood derivatives were removed over 99% by use of this filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of HLA antibodies was detected in 32.7% in control group, but was decreased to 17.1% (p &lt; 0.025) in the filter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-platelet specific antibodies were detected in 5 patients (5/226; 2.2%) and these antibodies existed together with HLA antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibodies in the 3 patients out of them were identified as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-2b (Siba), and those in the other 2 patients were considered to be combined antibodies by means of platelet identification panel and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the leukocyte removal filter was found useful for preventing production of HLA antibodies, and measures against <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-2b are considered necessary because platelet specific antibodies were produced in 2.2% of patients who received blood transfusion frequently </plain></SENT>
