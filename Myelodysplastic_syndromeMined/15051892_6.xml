<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The substantial degree of discrimination achieved between the two DNA groups is attributed to differences in the nucleotide base and backbone structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These structural differences allowed for the development of a discriminant analysis model that predicted, with high sensitivity and specificity, which DNA came from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocytes vs. granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings are a promising basis for developing a blood test to diagnose and predict the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, for which there is currently a paucity of molecular markers </plain></SENT>
