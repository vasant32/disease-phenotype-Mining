<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who achieved significant hematopoietic improvement following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) therapy and who is now transfusion independent for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This single observation supports the view that CsA, among other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, could play an important role in future treatment concepts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may lead to clinically relevant and sustained improvement of hematopoiesis in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
