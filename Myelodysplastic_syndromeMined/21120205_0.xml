<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis can provide important information in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, FISH performed in addition to G-banded karyotype can be labor-intensive and expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH gives additional information in the setting of adequate conventional cytogenetics in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 135 patients at diagnosis (56 AML, 32 MDS, 20 ALL, and 27 MM) between 2005 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH was performed using the following probes: BCR/ABL1, AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>, PML/RARA, CBFB, MLL, EGR1, CEP8, and D7S486 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; CEP8, D20S108, EGR1, and D7S486 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; BCR/ABL1, MLL, CDKN2A (p16), ETV6, and 6q21/c-myc for ALL; IgH, TP53, D13S25, IgH/CCND1, IgH/MAF, IgH/FGFR3, and 1q21/8p21 for MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the results of FISH with the corresponding aberrations identified by G-banded karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Additional genetic aberrations detected by FISH (which were not identified by G-banded karyotype) were 4%, 9%, 50%, and 67% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, ALL, and MM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ALL, CDKN2A and ETV6 FISH revealed additional genetic aberrations in 33% and 28% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In MM, FISH was of benefit in detecting IgH, D13S25, TP53, and 1q21 rearrangements, not detected by G-banded karyotype (31%, 36%, 20%, and 40%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that performing FISH in addition to G-banded karyotype may contribute little additional genetic information in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas routine FISH analysis appears to be an efficient screening method in ALL and MM </plain></SENT>
