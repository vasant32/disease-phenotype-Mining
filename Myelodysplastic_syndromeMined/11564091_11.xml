<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 150) receiving a BMT from an HLA-matched donor were investigated for a correlation between aGVHD and donor/recipient incompatibility for seven polymorphisms previously proposed for mHA (HA-1, H-Y, CD31-codon 125, CD31-codon 563, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-1, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-3 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-5) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk derived from CD31-codon 563 mismatch was the same as that derived from the use of bone marrow from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that donor/recipient compatibility at CD31-codon 563 should be added to HLA-typing for donor selection and/or adjustment of aGVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
