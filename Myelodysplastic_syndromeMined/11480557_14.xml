<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate plasma HGF levels and their prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique was used to quantify HGF in stored samples obtained before treatment from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (59 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (42 patients) treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HGF levels were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher HGF levels in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> correlated significantly with white blood cell (P = 0.000001 for both groups) and monocyte counts (P = 0.0004 and 0.003, respectively), and with poor performance status (P = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazard model and HGF levels as a continuous variable, plasma levels of HGF correlated with shorter survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.001), but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.34) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between HGF levels and complete remission rate or duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis HGF retained its significance as prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.02), along with age (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
