<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) remains a challenge due to the toxic conditioning regimens administered to minimize the risk of relapse in the HLA-matched or of graft rejection in the HLA-mismatched settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of matched sibling donors, alternative donors such as unrelated and/or partially matched family sources remain risky, yet the only available, options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we report the results of HCT from alternative donors in 14 children with different subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>] n = 9; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>] <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> n = 3; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation n = 2) transplanted at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to HCT was 9 months (range 4 to 90 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variety of HCT types included: unrelated peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) (n = 2), partially matched family donor T-cell-repleted BMT/PBPCT (n = 6), and haploidentical T-cell-depleted PBPCT (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of 14 patients remain alive at 7 to 37 months posttransplant (including two patients after partially matched family donor BMT, two patients after haploidentical T-cell-depleted-PBPCT, and one after unrelated-PBPCT, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major complications were: primary graft failure in the haploidentical T-cell-depleted-setting or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) in T-cell-repleted partially matched family or unrelated settings, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the high transplant-related mortality rate in this series, allogeneic HCT from alternative donors remains an interesting solution for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who lack matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to improved immune reconstitution, despite an increased risk of GvHD, T-cell-repleted transplants from single HLA-mismatched family donors remain a valuable option for children without matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy prior to HCT may positively affect the posttransplant course in patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> for example those afflicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
