<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment was begun with HU 1500 mg orally twice daily to lower white blood cell count below 10,000/microL, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> 75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously for 7 days and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> 3 mg/m(2) on day 8 </plain></SENT>
