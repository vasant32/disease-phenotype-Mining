<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-DNA glycosylase was investigated in biopsies from the antrum and body of the stomach obtained from nine PA patients, from five patients having atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (AG) not associated with PA, and from six control patients having transient upper abdominal complaints without AG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that there was a considerable interindividual variation in gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-DNA glycosylase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No clear correlation between the enzyme level and the level of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was noted, although AG is generally regarded as a risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-DNA glycosylase activities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in bone marrow cells in PA and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were similar to the activities observed previously in non-hematological patients and healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> incorporation into DNA may have a role in the cellular abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present findings demonstrated that the enzymatic activity required for rapid removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> from DNA is also expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
