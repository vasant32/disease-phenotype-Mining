<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient and donor were both blood type O, CcDEe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks post-transplantation, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was transfused multiple times with washed O red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-dose steroid therapy was initiated and he underwent splenectomy; however, AIHA was refractory to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was further treated with combined treatment modalities including immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and three cycles of plasma exchange, and AIHA responded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the third case of AIHA complicating hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reported in Korea </plain></SENT>
