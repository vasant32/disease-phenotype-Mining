<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PRV-1 and NB1 are alleles of the polymorphic gene CD177, which belongs to the Ly-6/uPAR superfamily, and their coding regions differ at only four <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied neutrophil CD177 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in 235 patients with Ph-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (CMD), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> were investigated for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly variable neutrophil CD177 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow, or from peripheral blood following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration showed markedly higher CD177 expression than circulating granulocytes on steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased neutrophil CD177 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated values were also found in reactive conditions and in disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the differential diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo>, the assay sensitivity was 68% while its specificity was 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that an elevated neutrophil CD177 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level is not a specific marker for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> nor for that of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From a clinical viewpoint, neutrophil CD177 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression is rather a marker of abnormal neutrophil production and/or release in patients with CMD </plain></SENT>
