<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human CD34+ cells were purified from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized blood stem cells, and erythroid progenitors were obtained by cultivating these cells in the presence of stem cell factor, interleukin 3, and erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our 10,202 SAGE tags allowed us to identify 1354 different transcripts appearing more than once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid progenitor cells showed increased expression of LRBA, EEF1A1, HSPCA, PILRB, RANBP1, NACA, and SMURF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of HSPCA was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MicroSAGE revealed an unexpected preferential expression of several genes in erythroid progenitor cells in addition to the known functional genes, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results provide reference data for future studies of gene expression in various hematopoietic disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
