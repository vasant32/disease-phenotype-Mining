<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies were performed to obtain evidence of the differentiating and hematopoietic potential of marrow clone-original cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, results of correlation analysis between bone marrow clonal cells and blast percentages for a total of 60 MDS showed that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had higher clonal (mean 50.1%) than blast proportion (mean 7.0%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 16 AML patients, mean clone/blasts disparity was nearly zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the amount of clone-original individual cells were defined in mature hematopoietic cells, mean 47.9% in segmented granulocytes, 47.1% in orthochromatic normoblasts and 37.8% in mature megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, FISH examination showed approximately similar proportions of clonal cells in peripheral blood and marrow for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 tested cases (mean 39.1% in blood vs 49.8% in marrow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neutrophils in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> peripheral blood oxidized dihydrorhodamine123 (DHR) nearly the same as neutrophils in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor's circulation, while obviously poor function was observed in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, research on clonality had an unexpected outcome as most of the typical morphological dysplastic cells possessed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings lead to the proposal that the biological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clones are distinctive from those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
