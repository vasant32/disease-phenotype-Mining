<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific alterations in complex karyotypes are difficult to define by conventional cytogenetics alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain a more comprehensive view of the recurrent aberrations, we performed spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with selected probes on bone marrow samples from 17 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 3 with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had chromosome 5 alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different types of 5q loss were identified: unbalanced translocations and interstitial deletions, or del(5q), each occurring in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent additional chromosome aberrations were -3/-3p/-3q, -7/7q-, +8, 13q-, -16, 17p-, -18/18p-, -20/20q-, and +21q, each occurring in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the five cases with gain of 21q, involvement of the AML1 gene was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unbalanced 5q translocations occurred more often in combination with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 3 and 7 and with gain of 21q, whereas del(5q) was associated more often with -1p and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A detailed analysis of specific breakpoints and deletions revealed recurrent involvement of specific chromosomal bands harboring known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes or oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of large numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases in a similar detailed manner with SKY and FISH will reveal whether new subgroups can be identified according to their genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation with clinical parameters may reveal the prognostic significance of these genetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
