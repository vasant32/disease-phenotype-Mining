<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a 55-year-old woman who was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> that was not attributable to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's treatment course was further complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> and hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> that ultimately led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
