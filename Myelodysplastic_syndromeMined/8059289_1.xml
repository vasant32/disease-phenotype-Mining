<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was performed with the chi 2 and Student's tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> was present in 96.9% of the patients, regardless of the cytologic classification </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TF: Transfusion was required by 90.2% of the patients (86% of the RA, 79.6% of the RSA, 48.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 97.9% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, and 100% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean TF was 1.5 months (1.9 for RA, 1.7 for RSA, 1.3 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 0.9 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 2.2. for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PT: Platelet support was needed by 38.1% of the patients (30.5% of RA, 8.1% of RSA, 48.2% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 58.3% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and 64.3% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean number of PT per patient was 7.2 (5.2 for RA, 3.8 for RSA, 9.7 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 10.2 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 7.1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The differences appreciated in TF were significant for the good prognostic groups (RA + RSA) as compared with the poor-risk ones (AREB + AREB-T + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) (p &lt; 0.01), although significance is lost when these groups were taken one by one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For PT, significant differences appeared when comparing RA + RSA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001); when the groups were compared one by one, significant differences were found only for RA versus RSA (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) Red cell support was required by 90.2% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while platelet support was needed in 38.1% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2) The cytologic poor-risk groups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) required greater transfusion support as a whole than did the good prognostic ones (RA + RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>3) However, only RA showed significant differences with respect to RSA regarding PT, the remaining groups showing no such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>4) An irregular pattern was seen in RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> with respect to PT in the former and to both TF and PT in the latter </plain></SENT>
