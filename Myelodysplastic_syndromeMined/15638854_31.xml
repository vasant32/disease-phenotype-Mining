<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (40.5%) achieved an erythroid response (13 major and two minor improvements, respectively, according to International Working Group criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such results are currently maintained after 7-22 months in 13 of the responders, one of whom required iron substitutive therapy during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed after 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another responder died after 5 months because of causes unrelated to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relevant side-effects were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, significant predictive factors of response were baseline serum levels of endogenous erythropoietin &lt;100 IU/l, absent or limited transfusional needs, no excess of blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that DPO, at the dose and schedule used, can be safely given in low-intermediate risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be effective in a significant proportion of these patients </plain></SENT>
