<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the cost and effectiveness of RIST with those of stem cell transplantation using a conventional myeloablative regimen (CST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Life years and medical costs during the entire treatment course for up to 2 years after transplantation were evaluated, and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the payer's perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Of these 50 cases, 35 were treated with CST and 15 were treated with RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean survival time was 1.5 years in CST and 1.2 years in RIST, while the mean total cost per patient within the first 2 years was $29,630 for CST and $29,466 for RIST, with no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of total hospitalization was shorter in RIST than in CST; then, the cost for hospitalization represented a lower proportion of the total cost in RIST (49% of total cost) than in CST (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the cost related to the conditioning regimen was significantly higher in RIST than in CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that the increased cost of the conditioning regimen offsets the reduced cost of hospitalization in RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although some differences were observed in the details of the cost, the total cost and mean survival were comparable between CST and RIST, and this result was confirmed by a probabilistic sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
