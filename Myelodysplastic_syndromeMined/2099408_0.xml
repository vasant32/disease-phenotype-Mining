<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed Southern blot analysis of the p53 gene in 62 patients (37 de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), of which 10 were studied after progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); 14 MDS secondary to chemo or radiotherapy; 11 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 56 patients studied cytogenetically had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for the short arm of chromosome 17 and, in another patient who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, a translocation involving a breakpoint in 17p13 where the p53 gene was mapped was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This patient was the only individual in whom a rearrangement of p53 DNA was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 62 patients were studied by Northern analysis, and reduced or undetectable 2.8 kb p53 transcript was found in 6 of them, who had predominantly <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 17p or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the 53 gene, identifiable by Southern analysis, are a rare finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, even in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 17p, but reduced expression of the p53 gene is relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We are currently trying to detect point mutations of the p53 gene by PCR technology especially in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 17p </plain></SENT>
