<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lenalidomide leads to toxicities, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e> reaction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis, even at low dosing, that is not anticipated with lenalidomide therapy in other disorders </plain></SENT>
