<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bands of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> 11p13, 11p14, llp15 and the long arms 11q14, 11q21, 11q23 were involved in chromosome rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rearrangements of the band 11q23 were detected more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal translocations were found with the highest frequency, while para- and pericentic invertions, terminal and intestitial deletions occured with the lower incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletions were found in RA cases only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison with the clinical features showed no correlation with the age and the main haematological indexes including the amount of blast cells in the initial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results have showed the poor prognosis of the abnormalities not only of 11q21, 11q23 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL), but of 11p13, 11p15 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as well, while not enough data on this subject is availalbe in the literature </plain></SENT>
