<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite improved surgical techniques as many as 20% of women with early stage disease will eventually relapse and die from their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The post-operative management of these women remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present the long term follow-up data of our previously published study, as well as the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary malignancies</z:e> in these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifty-seven eligible patients with stage I, IIA 'high risk' <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp> and IIB, IIIO (disease confined to pelvis) were randomized to either whole abdominal radiotherapy 2.250 rads in ten fractions (107 patients), melphalan 8 mg/m2/d x 4 weeks x 18 courses (106 patients) or intraperitoneal chromic phosphate 10-20 mCi (44 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were initially treated with pelvic radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival estimates at 10 years were: 45% in the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm; 49% in the melphalan arm and 50% in the intraperitoneal chromic phosphate arm (P = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse-free survival estimates at 10 years were: 50% in the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm, 62% in the melphalan arm and 51% in the chromic phosphate arm (P = 0.147) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long term follow-up has not demonstrated a significant difference between treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Second primary malignancies</z:e> developed in 29 women (11%) after 2,229 person years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compares to 18.7 second primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> which would have been expected in this group of age-matched controls and was statistically significant (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary malignancies</z:e> between treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Melphalan appeared to be associated with an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> compared to the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up has not demonstrated a significant difference in overall or disease free survival between treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary malignancies</z:e> (35%) was observed suggesting that lifelong surveillance is required in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further research with newer treatment programs are needed to improve the cure rates in this population </plain></SENT>
