<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of colony growth was detected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three HGFs in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, exhibiting subnormal growth of GM-CFU and markedly poor to absent growth of BFU-E and CFU-GEMM </plain></SENT>
