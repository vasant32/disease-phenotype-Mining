<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> is a widely distributed environmental contaminant known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and perhaps other hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few epidemiologic studies, however, have been able to address relationships between the extent of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure and the level of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A large cohort study was carried out in China to evaluate the risks of developing specific hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and selected related disorders in relationship to quantitative estimates of occupational <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 74828 benzene-exposed and 35805 unexposed workers employed from 1972 through 1987 in 12 cities in China was identified and followed to determine the incidence of hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimates of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure were derived from work histories and available historic <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Existing pathologic material and supporting medical records were reviewed to establish diagnoses of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) (i.e., ratios of incidence rates for specific hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and related disorders in the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-exposed group to incidence rates in the unexposed group) were determined by use of Poisson regression analysis, with stratification by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For workers historically exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> at average levels of less than 10 parts per million (ppm), the RR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> combined was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-4.2), and, for the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, the RR was 3.2 (95% CI = 1.0-10.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For individuals who were occupationally exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> at constant levels of 25 ppm or more, the RR for the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> was 7.1 (95% CI = 2.1-23.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Workers with 10 or more years of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure had an RR of developing non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of 4.2 (95% CI = 1.1-15.9), and the development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was linked most strongly to exposure that had occurred at least 10 years before diagnosis (i.e., distant exposure) (P for trend = .005, two-sided) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the risk for the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> was significantly increased among those with more recent <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure (P for trend = .003, two-sided), but it was not linked to distant exposure (P for trend = .51, two-sided) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure is associated with a spectrum of hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and related disorders in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risks for these conditions are elevated at average <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-exposure levels of less than 10 ppm and show a tendency, although not a strong one, to rise with increasing levels of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The temporal pattern of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure appears to be important in determining the risk of developing specific diseases </plain></SENT>
