<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the increases in EVI1 DNA copy number and MDS1/EVI1 transcripts are associated with improved patient outcomes, whereas EVI1 transcript levels are associated with a poor patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the favorable patient prognosis associated with increased DNA copy number seems to be as a result of high-level expression of the fusion transcript MDS1/EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies suggest that MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1, previously implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
