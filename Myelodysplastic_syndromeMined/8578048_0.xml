<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their crude annual incidence (ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4/100,000), is now about twice that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In over 70-year-old patients (age-related incidence more than 20/100,000), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> rival CLL as the most common hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is based on cytological and histological examination of bone marrow specimens, which may show various dysplastic features of hematopoietic precursors and an increased percentage of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In difficult cases the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is supported if cytogenetic investigation reveals an abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (60 bis 80%) die from their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorder</z:e>, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and leukemic transformation being the most frequent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment must take into account the age and general condition of the individual patient as well as the natural course of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comparatively favourable prognosis of patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should not be jeopardized by therapies carrying a high risk of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, treatment is often confined to supportive measures (blood transfusions, antibiotics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased percentage of blasts, however, have such a poor prognosis that more aggressive approaches including intensive chemotherapy appear justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only very few patients can be treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which offers a chance for cure </plain></SENT>
