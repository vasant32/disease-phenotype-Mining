<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The article is concerned with incidence, clinical features, response to therapy, and prognosis of patients with hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) cellularity &lt;30% (or &lt;20% in patients &gt;70 yr) was found in 24 of 236 (10.2%) trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 61 yr, with significant male predominance (M/F=3.0) At diagnosis, median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was 83 g/L, median platelet and neutrofil counts were 31x109/L and 1.2x109/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to FAB classification, 17 patients had RA, 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and only 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beside marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, the most prominent PH finding was megakaryocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, found in two-thirds of cases, each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison between hypocellular and normo/hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases regarding clinicopathological features showed younger age, more severe cytopenia, less blood and BM blast infiltration, MK hypoproliferation, and more pronounced stromal reactions in former cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic abnormalities were present in 12.5% hypocellular cases, in contrast to 44.6% normo/hypercellular cases (p=0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were treated with supportive therapy alone, six with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, six with immunosuppressive therapy, and one with LDARAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, complete or partial response was achieved in only four patients treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died, so marrow insufficiency was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 33 mo for hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 19 mo for normo/hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the existence of hypocellular variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which seems to have better prognosis than those patients with normo/hypercellular disease </plain></SENT>
