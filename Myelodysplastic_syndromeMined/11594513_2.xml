<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human G-CSF (Lenograstim) was administered by daily subcutaneous injection with an initial dosage of 0.5 microg/kg per day for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients not responding to the initial dosage received the escalated dosage, 1 to 2 microg/kg per day for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria were the following: French-American-British disease classification subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;1.5 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria indicating response to treatment were ANC of &gt;1.5 x 10(9)/L and doubling of ANC on at least 2 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were recruited from 6 university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had RA, 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, and 10 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 56.4 years (range, 28-87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (81.2%) had an increase in ANC from a median of 0.94+/-0.35 x 10(9)/L to 4.24+/-3.78 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 6 patients who did not respond to the initial dosage responded to the escalated dosage of 1 microg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (81.8%) of 22 patients with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> responded compared with 8 (80%) of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The response rates in patients with ANCs of &lt;0.5 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>0.5 to &lt;1.0 x 10(9)/L, and 1.0 to 1.5 x 10(9)/L were 80%, 70%, and 88.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The side effects were minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels or platelet counts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low-dose G-CSF administered by subcutaneous injection is well tolerated and effective in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
