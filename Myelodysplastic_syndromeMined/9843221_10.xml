<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the frequency and sequelae of portal system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (PST) after splenectomy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and to determine whether routine surveillance imaging for this potential complication is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The radiology reports of 203 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> who underwent splenectomy between January 1990 and January 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging examinations and medical records were reviewed for those in whom PST was found after splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients (60.6%) underwent CT (n = 88), sonography (n = 10), or both (n = 24) after splenectomy; one other patient underwent MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these patients (9.8%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the splenic, portal, and/or superior mesenteric veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their underlying diseases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up imaging (obtained in 10 of the 12 patients), PST had resolved (n = 5), worsened (n = 2), improved (n = 1), remained unchanged (n = 1), or resulted in cavernous transformation of the portal vein (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of 12 patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient died of PST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PST was an uncommon and typically unsuspected finding after splenectomy in this patient population, and no serious sequelae of PST were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine surveillance imaging for PST after splenectomy does not seem warranted, but in symptomatic patients (particularly those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>), a high clinical suspicion and a low threshold for obtaining imaging examinations are needed </plain></SENT>
