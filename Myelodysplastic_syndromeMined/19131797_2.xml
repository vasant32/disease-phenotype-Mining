<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can occur in any organ or tissue, but the most common involved areas are the skin, bone/spine, and lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract is relatively rare, and is especially rare in the colon in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No case of GS involving the colon in children has ever been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here an extremely rare case of GS in the colon of a 10-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonic GS was diagnosed by colonofiberscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> responded rapidly to induction chemotherapy and the patient remained in complete remission after 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> may be due to colonic involvement of GS, which should be considered in the differentials in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, as it is usually encountered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
