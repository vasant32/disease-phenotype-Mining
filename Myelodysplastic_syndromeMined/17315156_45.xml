<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensive chemotherapy is an accepted form of therapy for patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparative efficacy of these 2 forms of treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and intensive chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors compared lower intensity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>]) in patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> criteria was 43% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was better with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis of survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 491 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = .006; hazard ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> was associated with a survival advantage compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies should evaluate prospectively the results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus intensive chemotherapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
