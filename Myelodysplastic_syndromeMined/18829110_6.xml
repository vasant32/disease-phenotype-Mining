<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore a possible mechanism, we therefore analyzed expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) subtypes kinetics and aberrant promoter methylation of key regulatory genes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An in vitro model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> lineage-specific hematopoiesis was generated by culturing CD34+ cells from healthy donors (n=7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (low-risk: RA/n=6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>/n=3; high-risk: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/n=4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>/n=2) with EPO, TPO and GCSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation analysis of key genes involved in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (p73, survivin, DAPK), DNA-repair (hMLH1), differentiation (RARb, WT1) and cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2) was performed by methylation specific PCR of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b was analyzed and correlated with gene promoter methylation for each lineage at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNMT expression (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isoforms) was increased during thrombopoiesis whereas elevated DNMT1 level were seen during erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between aberrant promoter methylation and DNMT expression were found in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lineages and during erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of p15, p16, p73, survivin, CHK2, RARb and DAPK were associated with elevated DNMT isoform expression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian DNMT isoforms may be involved in the aberrantly methylated phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but seem also to be essential for the differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
