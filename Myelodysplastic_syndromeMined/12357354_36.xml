<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that may play a role in a significant proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to being aberrantly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, activating mutations of the FLT3 gene have been found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and more rarely, ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the FLT3 gene have been detected in 17-34% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and portend a poor prognosis for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FLT3 receptors containing ITD mutations (FLT3/ITDs) are constitutively activated in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation leading to the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including ERK and STAT 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLT3 activity, therefore, is a logical target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AG1296 is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> of the tyrphostin class that shows inhibitory activity for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FLT3, in addition to the PDGF and c-KIT receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the inhibitory effects of AG1296 on FLT3/ITDs isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients in the IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, as well as in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that FLT3/ITDs were constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The auto-phosphorylation of FLT3/ITDs was inhibited by AG1296 with an IC(50) of approximately 1 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FLT3/ITDs were associated with constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, STAT 5A, STAT 5B, CBL, VAV and SHP2 in Ba/F3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of these downstream signaling molecules was suppressed in a dose-responsive fashion by AG1296 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AG1296 inhibited IL-3 independent growth and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ba/F3 cells transformed by FLT3/ITDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AG1296 also inhibited FLT3 auto-phosphorylation, and induced a cytotoxic effect, in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that inhibiting the activity of FLT3 may have a therapeutic value in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> expressing FLT3/ITDs </plain></SENT>
