<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> 20 mg/m(2)/day was given intravenously over one hour for five consecutive days every four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was overall response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System risk category was Intermediate-2/High in 47.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A median of 5 courses (range 1-18) were delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 55.4% (13 complete responses, one partial response, 23 marrow complete responses, and 19 hematologic improvements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (47.5%) showed some hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 478 days (range 69-595), median overall survival was 17.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed hematologic improvement had significantly longer overall survival than those who did not (19.2 vs. 15.9 months, P=0.006 by landmark analysis at six months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference in overall survival was evident in the Intermediate-2/High risk group but not in the Intermediate-1 risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival were 61.9% and 77.9% at one year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 489 assessable treatment courses, there were 97 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> episodes requiring intravenous antimicrobials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> treatment was feasible and effective in Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and the overall survival was significantly longer in patients showing hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
