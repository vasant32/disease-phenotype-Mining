<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dual color probes CEP 7 labeled by SpectrumGreen and D7S486 (locus at 7q31) labeled by SpectrumOrange were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of -7/7q- in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was 4.51% (31 out of 687 cases) and 5.71% (28 out of 490 cases), respectively, and was 5.68% and 10.29% in these patients with abnormal karyotype, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common deletion region of 7q- was 7q21a222 (ten cases) and 7q31-35(ten cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH assay confirmed the -7/7q- aberration in those with clonal -7/7q- abnormalities, but failed in those with random -7/7q- and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7q- group, FISH revealed seven of eleven cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 clone detected in the same specimen, but the numbers of 7q- interphases cells were much greater than those of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cells (average 42.5% vs 8.4%, P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH also provided precise refinement for three chromosomal structural abnormalities associated with 7q seen in CAA, one case with del(7)(q22) being refined as chromosomal translocation, one case with 7q+ being confirmed as dup(7q), and one case with complex translocation involving 7q being also proved to be true </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>-7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q- </plain></SENT>
