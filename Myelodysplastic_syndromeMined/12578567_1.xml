<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracellular telomerase activity was semi-quantitatively examined by PCR-ELISA assay in the marrow cells of 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, 21 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells was 0 - 0.30 U, with a mean level of (0.11 +/- 0.08) U, in which 3 cases were considered positive according to the standard set by the Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients, the mean level of telomerase activity was (0.42 +/- 0.26) U (ranged 0 - 0.96 U) with a positive rate of 78.1%, showing a significantly higher activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate telomerase activity was detected in 21 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with a mean level of (0.27 +/- 0.19) U (0 - 0.97 U) from which the positive rate was 66.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This value was significantly higher than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significantly higher telomerase activity was shown in the high-risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the international scoring system evaluating the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (IPPS), telomerase activity in HIGH subgroup was significantly higher than that in INT-1 and INT-2 subgroup (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of telomerase activity was not correlated to the chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that a borderline telomerase activity could be found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was markedly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BM of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients demonstrated a moderate telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher telomerase activity could be found in high-risk group and correlated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
