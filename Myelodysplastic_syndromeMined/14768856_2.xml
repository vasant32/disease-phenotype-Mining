<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection may be a main concern for NM-BMT in high-risk patients such as unrelated-donor BMT and elder recipients, however, very few literatures have mentioned this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report 2 cases of NM-BMT where delayed rejection developed after initial engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case was a victim of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase receiving HLA-matched unrelated-donor (MUD) BMT using the non-myeloablative regimen (fludarabine/busulphan/ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chimerism study after BMT revealed successful initial engraftment, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> developed since day +38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination on day +47 revealed only 15% of donor-type cells, with subsequent salvage haploidentical BMT failing to engraft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient expired on day +71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second case was a victim of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, received HLA-matched sibling-donor allogeneic BMT using the same regimen as for Case 1, with successful initial engraftment proved by chimerism study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> was noted since day +124, and chimerism study on day +127 revealed only 25% of donor-type cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient expired on day +151 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the suitability of NM-BMT for high-risk patients such as unrelated-donor BMT and elder recipients needs further studies to confirm </plain></SENT>
