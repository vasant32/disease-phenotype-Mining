<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that malignant clone already exists in the bone marrow of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases of them have transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of transforming into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> were markedly higher than that in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The courses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> which transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from the various types were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transformation in RA was obviously longer than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> according to the FAB classification criteria revealed that it has two forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One shows only increase of mature monocytes and it has no relation with the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> to be transformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is considered as a reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other form, in addition to increase of mature monocytes, also has increase of a few monoblasts and promonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These are considered as true <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and usually quickly developed into M4 or M5 which are related with monocytes </plain></SENT>
