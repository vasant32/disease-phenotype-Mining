<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: An 11-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> was found to have mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> that persisted during 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Examination of the bone marrow revealed dyserythropoietic features with multinucleation consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> F were also markedly elevated (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She also had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011869'>abnormal platelet function</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic abnormalities were mild and may have been missed were she not followed for her <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in children are frequently associated with chromosomal abnormalities, but an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> has not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the fact that mild hematopoietic abnormalities in these patients may not be investigated </plain></SENT>
