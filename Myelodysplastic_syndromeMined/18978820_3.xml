<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 201 patients receiving HLA-identical related allo-SCTs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 163 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> 68, ALL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 63, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 12 and others 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SeS was defined according to the Brazilian Association of Market Research Agencies classification, where people are clustered in groups A-E (richest to poorest) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 146 patients (72%) were classified as richest (A+B+C) and 55 (28%) as poorest (D+E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The D+E SeS group was associated with a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (hazard ratio (HR)=2.61; P=0.001 and HR=2.62; P=0.001, respectively), better platelet and neutrophil engraftment (HR=1.94; P=&lt;0.001 and HR=2.12; P=0.001) and with a higher TRM in multivariate analysis (HR=1.92; P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimated overall survival at 5 years was 55.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A D+E SeS (HR=2.13; P=0.001) was associated with a worse survival on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a lower SeS is a strong prognostic factor in patients undergoing allo-SCT in Brazil, influencing engraftment, TRM and overall survival </plain></SENT>
