<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated 9,550 patients with myeloid disorders for ETV6 rearrangements by chromosome banding analysis and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ETV6 rearrangements were identified in 51 of 9,550 (0.5%) patients (range, 19.2-85.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequencies were in detail: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>): 40 of 3,798, 1.1%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>): 6 of 3,375, 0.2%; myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPNs): 5 of 1,720, 0.3%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN: 0 of 210; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>: 0 of 447 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three different partner bands of ETV6 were identified, and most were recurrent: 3q26 (n = 10), 5q33 (n = 4), 17q11 (n = 3), 22q12 (n = 3), 5q31 (n = 2), and 2q31 (n = 2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ETV6 rearrangements were frequently associated with NPM1 (9/39, 23%) and RUNX1 mutations (6/31, 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522631" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M0</z:e> subtype was more frequent in ETV6 rearranged de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001); expression of CD7 and CD34 by immunophenotyping was higher in ETV6 rearranged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compared with other subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival of 29 ETV6 rearranged de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was compared with 818 AML from other cytogenetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall and event-free survival of ETV6 rearranged cases was similar to the intermediate-risk cohort (26.3 vs. 62.2 months and 14.0 vs. 15.4 months) defined according to Medical Research Council criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms the variety of ETV6 rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and MPNs often in association with other genetic events </plain></SENT>
