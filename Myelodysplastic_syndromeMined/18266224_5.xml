<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We identified 91 patients in the database, which includes newly diagnosed subjects &lt;21 years old with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (RMS) and undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and reviewed their charts in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 54 males and 37 females were &lt;1-19 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary sites were nasopharynx-nasal cavity, middle ear/mastoid and parapharyngeal area ("better" sites, 55%), paranasal sinus and infratemporal-pterygopalatine area ("worse" sites, 42%), and other (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of informative patients had direct intracranial extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major metastatic sites at diagnosis were lung (63%), bone marrow (33%), and bone (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (VAC) chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and up to five metastatic sites/tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: The estimated 10-year failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) rate was 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22%, 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients had progressive disease (N = 49) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a first event (N = 11); another developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sites of first progression/relapse were distant (55%), local (12%), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> extension (8%), mixed (6%), and uncertain (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors indicating likelihood of 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> arising in "better" versus "worse" sites (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> 46% vs. 18%, P = 0.02) and embryonal versus other histology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> 37% vs. 19%, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cure was possible for some patients with metastatic cranial parameningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with the best outlook had embryonal RMS located in the nasopharynx/nasal cavity, middle ear/mastoid, or parapharyngeal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were the most frequent type of recurrence, indicating that more effective systemic agents are needed to eliminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
