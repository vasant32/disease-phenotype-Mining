<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DLK1 encodes an EGF-like homeotic transmembrane protein homologous to the notch/delta/serrate family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although exogenous DLK1 promotes maintenance of murine hematopoietic stem cells, the functional effects of DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that ectopically expressed DLK1 significantly inhibits differentiation and proliferation of human promyelocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike preadipocytes, where proteolytic processing of membrane-bound protein and release of a soluble form mediates differentiation inhibition, proteolytic release of the extracellular domain was not required for inhibition of hematopoietic cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, intracellular domain interactions were critical to this DLK1 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells has important functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies identify novel molecular mechanisms and indicate that DLK1 has activity both as a soluble and a transmembrane expressed protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support further investigation of the role of DLK1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hematopoiesis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
