<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficient regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play an important role in many pathological conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several methods have been described to identify apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA strand breaks can be identified by labeling free 3'-OH termini with modified <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> by enzymatic reaction (TUNEL method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was introduced in cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>, and the TUNEL method was adapted for electromicroscopy, called the EM TUNEL method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the EM TUNEL method were compared with those of light microscopy and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cells following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (10 micrograms/mL) treatment were detected after 3 h by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methods (light microscopy, Erythrocin B, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, TUNEL, and EM TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EM TUNEL was the most sensitive method of detection, with a detection rate of 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EM TUNEL was more suitable for distinguishing cell lineage than light microscopy TUNEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that EM TUNEL can be used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in bone marrow species in vivo </plain></SENT>
