<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some other risk factors have been suggested by the few epidemiological studies reported (solvents, ammonia, exhaust gases, metals, pesticides, alcohol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study to assess the relationship between occupational or environmental factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and four patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 204 sex- and age-matched controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical history, demographic data, lifetime exposure and hobbies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative exposure to chemical and physical hazards were evaluated with the patients and reviewed by a group of experts in occupational exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 70 years and 62% of the patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, we found relationships between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and smoking habits, gardening, occupations such as health professionals, technical and sale representatives, machine operators, agricultural workers, textile workers, qualitative occupational exposures (exposed/non-exposed) to oil, solvents, ammonia, pesticides, fertilizers, cereal dusts, contact with poultry or livestock and infective risk, and lifetime cumulative exposure to solvents, oil, textile dust and infective risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> determined by multivariate analyses (conditional logistic regression) were, being an agricultural worker [odds ratio (OR) = 3.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-7.0], textile operator (OR = 3.66; 95% CI 1.9-7.9), health professional (OR = 10.0; 95% CI 2.1-48.7), commercial and technical sale representative (OR = 4.45; 95% CI 1.4-14.6), machine operator (OR = 2.69; 95% CI 1.2-6.0), living next to an industrial plant (OR = 2.45; 95% CI 1.5-4.1), smoking (OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.1-2.7) and lifetime cumulative exposure to oil (OR = 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be performed to assess specific exposures more precisely and it would be of interest to develop a map of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> according to industrial background </plain></SENT>
