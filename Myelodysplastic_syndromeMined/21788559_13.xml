<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> (AZA) is the current standard of care for high-risk (ie, International Prognostic Scoring System high or intermediate 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), but most patients will experience primary or secondary treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these patients has not yet been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 435 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and former <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) were evaluated for outcome after AZA failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort of patients included four data sets (ie, AZA001, J9950, and J0443 trials and the French compassionate use program) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up after AZA failure was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 5.6 months, and the 2-year survival probability was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing age, male sex, high-risk cytogenetics, higher bone marrow blast count, and the absence of prior hematologic response to AZA were associated with significantly worse survival in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data on treatment administered after AZA failure were available for 270 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and investigational agents were associated with a better outcome when compared with conventional clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcome after AZA failure is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results should serve as a basis for designing second-line clinical trials in this population </plain></SENT>
