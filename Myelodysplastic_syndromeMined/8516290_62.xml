<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Loss of a whole chromosome 5 or a deletion of its long arm (5q) is a recurring abnormality in malignant myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the location of genes on 5q that may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, we examined the deleted chromosome 5 homologs in a series of 135 patients with malignant myeloid diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By comparing the breakpoints, we identified a small segment of 5q, consisting of band 5q31, that was deleted in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This segment has been termed the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distal 5q contains a number of genes encoding growth factors, hormone receptors, and proteins involved in signal transduction or transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include several genes that are good candidates for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene, as well as the genes encoding five hematopoietic growth factors (CSF2, IL3, IL4, IL5, and IL9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have refined the localization of these genes to 5q31.1 and have determined the order of these genes and of other markers within 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By hybridizing probes to metaphase cells with overlapping deletions involving 5q31, we have narrowed the critical region to a small segment of 5q31 containing the EGR1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The five hematopoietic growth factor genes and seven other genes are excluded from this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EGR1 gene was not deleted in nine other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> who did not have abnormalities of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By physical mapping, the minimum size of the critical region was estimated to be 2.8 megabases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cytogenetic map of 5q31, together with the molecular characterization of the critical region, will facilitate the identification of a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene in this band </plain></SENT>
