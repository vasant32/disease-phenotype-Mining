<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is an increasing interest on one of the smallest human chromosomes as it is shown by the First International Symposium on the Human Chromosome 20 and by the genetic map prepared by EUROGEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conserved part of the long arm of human chromosome 20 is synthenic with the distal part of the mouse chromosome 2 allowing for some analogies between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 20 contains several important genes for the human pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations of one of them, the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene, are responsible for hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000863'>neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>Severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16335">adenosin</z:chebi> deaminase deficiency is the first human disorder successfully treated by somatic gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spongiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo> are related to mutation and/or polymorphisms of the PRNP amyloid gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One form of benign familiar neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> is mapped to a specific locus on chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some families, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) is caused by alterations of a hypothetical gene closely linked to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allegile syndrome is often associated with deletions and microdeletions of the short arm of the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, deletions of the long arm of the chromosome is a frequent finding in several hematologic malignities, specifically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
