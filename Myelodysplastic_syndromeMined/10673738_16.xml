<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether the null genotype for GSTM1, GSTT1, or both, was more frequent in children with ALL who developed treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> as compared to those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A PCR technique was used to assay for the null genotype for GSTM1 and GSTT1 in 302 children with ALL, 57 of whom also subsequently developed treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in the frequency of the GST null genotype was observed in male patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> as compared to male ALL control patients (P = 0.036), but was not observed in female patients (P = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
