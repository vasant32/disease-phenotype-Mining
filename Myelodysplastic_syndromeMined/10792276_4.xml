<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An activating mutation in c-kit, involving an A --&gt; T substitution at nucleotide 2648 has recently been described in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a 12-year-old girl with this mutation in her bone marrow cells at diagnosis with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, and then in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 1 year later after the emergence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of the c-Kit receptor and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) in the pathogenesis of the disease was analysed in marrow cell clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that the genetic abnormalities in the patient resulted in factor-independent growth and hypersensitivity of primitive progenitors to SCF, with increased production of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> and cluster formation, consistent with the myelodysplastic nature of the disorder, accompanied accumulation of abnormal cells with increasing concentrations of SCF </plain></SENT>
