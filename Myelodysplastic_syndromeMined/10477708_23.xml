<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> results from the pretransplant conventional-dose chemotherapy or from the high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) used for the transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pretransplant marrow or stem cell specimens from 12 patients who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> after HDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine if the abnormal clone was present before HDC, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the cytogenetic markers observed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved, pretransplant bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell specimens, obtained at the time of harvest, or archival smears were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard cytogenetic analysis had been performed pretransplant in four patients, showing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 12 cases, the same cytogenetic abnormality observed at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis was detected by FISH in the pre-HDC specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis that, in many cases of posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the stem cell damage results from prior conventional-dose chemotherapy and may be unrelated to HDC or the transplantation process itself </plain></SENT>
