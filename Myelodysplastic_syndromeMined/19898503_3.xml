<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis studied the impact of natural killer (NK) alloreactivity based on the missing ligand model, for a cohort of recipients undergoing haemopoietic stem cell transplant without T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> from HLA full-matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a uniform myeloablative conditioning regimen and prophylaxis for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 151 patients were studied, including 62 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 42 patients with ALL and 47 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that 81% of patients had at least one missing KIR-ligand (KIR-L), and HLA-C1 allogroup homozygosity is present in 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From multivariate analysis, we observed that the only consistently significant factor that was associated with superior survival was disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Missing KIR-L, whether considering HLA-Bw and HLA-C alleles, without or with HLA-A ligands or narrowing to only HLA-C alleles alone to classify the number of missing KIR-L, did not have any impact on OS or relapse-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This negative finding implies that as the KIR-L composition of recipient is not important in this matched non-T-depleted setting, further immunotherapeutic measures involving adoptive NK cell infusions have to be explored to exploit the benefit of NK alloreactivity for such transplants </plain></SENT>
