<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicians still have no standard therapies surely able to obtain a better result in the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t in particular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the costs due to the specific drug, to its clinical complications and to the days spent in hospital can be influenced by the chosen therapeutic regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no published studies regarding a cost-benefit relationship of the different drugs commonly used today for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study refers to 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, followed in our Division from 1986 up to December 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed specific therapies (ARA-C vs other drugs, in particular), the costs supported by the National Health Service and the effects of the same therapies in terms of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results have been worked out by statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some interesting data are presented in this study: chemotherapy does not improve survival and causes higher costs; the length of stay in hospital is not influenced by using chemotherapy or not; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients cause as high costs as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the study regards only a limited number of cases, it shows that the therapeutic efforts made so far in order to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' prognosis cannot be considered satisfying and their social cost is very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our report can be a useful starting-point for a QA analysis concerning the rational use of new drugs such as growth factors and interleukins </plain></SENT>
