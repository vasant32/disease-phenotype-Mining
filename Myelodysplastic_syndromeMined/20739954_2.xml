<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One analysis with 80 samples from 29 patients and 51 control subjects resulted in the detection of 61 peak differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another analysis with 36 paired-samples from 18 patients collected before and after the treatment with lenalidomide (Revlimid) identified 19 differential peak features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed differential profiles between the pre-treatment samples from the responders and those from the non-responders reflected by eight peak differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data we developed two classification models that could distinguish between the diseased and the control subjects or between the responders and the non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efforts were made to purify and identify a range of differential peak proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inter-Î± trypsin inhibitor, heavy chain H4 (fragments), serum transferrin, transthyretin (variants), <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and a protein peak at m/z 2791 could be potential disease-associated markers for del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and a peak at m/z 8559 may serve as therapy-associated markers and be potentially useful for monitoring and predicting the response to therapy </plain></SENT>
