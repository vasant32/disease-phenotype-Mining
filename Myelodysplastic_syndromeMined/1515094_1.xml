<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before therapy plasma lactoferrin content was uniformly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and those with chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lactoferrin:neutrophil ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The low levels of plasma lactoferrin thus reflected the low granulocyte mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> also had reduced lactoferrin:neutrophil ratios, suggesting qualitative/quantitative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001911'>abnormalities of neutrophil</z:hpo> lactoferrin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, plasma lactoferrin levels increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and in those with chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> who showed a neutrophil response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the lactoferrin:neutrophil ratio became elevated, suggesting increased synthesis/release of lactoferrin from neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> continued to show depressed lactoferrin:neutrophil ratios, even when there had been an increase in granulocyte count, suggesting persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001911'>abnormalities of neutrophil</z:hpo> lactoferrin production/release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings for treatment of neutropenic patients with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors are discussed </plain></SENT>
