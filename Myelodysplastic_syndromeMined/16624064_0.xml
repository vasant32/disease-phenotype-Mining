<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the related factors affecting unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation, the authors analyzed retrospectively the results of transplantation of unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cells for 65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ALL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) cord blood units were obtained from full term <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vaginal and cesarean deliveries in Guangzhou Women and Infants Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fractionation, cryopreservation and thawing of the cord blood were performed according to the regulations of New York umbilical cord blood bank and pertinent literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selection of cord blood was based on HLA typing and the number of nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sex and HLA antigens of donors were defined as the evidence of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to engraftment was recorded when the absolute number of neutrophil ANC (absolute neutrophil count) was higher than 5.0 x 10(8) for three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) were provided by transplant centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 65 patients who received unrelated cord blood stem cell transplant, 49 patients were diagnosed as having malignant diseases [including 23 with ALL, 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>), 7 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>), 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>)], 16 patients had non-malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 65 transplanted patients (42 male, 23 female) had a median age of 10 years (range 1 - 33 years) and a median body weight of 27 kg (range 10 - 67 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients received cord blood stem cells from unrelated 0-locus (n = 9) or 1-locus (n = 43) or 2-locus (n = 13) HLA mismatched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median dose of infused cells was: total neutrophil count (TNC) 5.7 x 10(7), CD(34)(+) 5.1 x 10(5), CFU-GM 3.8 x 10(4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifty of 65 (77%) patients had engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GVHD occurred in 41 patients (63%), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade I - II GVHD in 31 patients (76%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade III - IV GVHD in 8 patients (20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in 2 patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients had engraftment (ANC &gt; 5.0 x 10(8)) after a median time of 17 (range 7 to 44) days after transplant, while an autologous hematopoietic reconstitution was observed in 6 patients; 24 patients died of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (n = 4), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (n = 12) and the disease-free survival probability was 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation may be a good substitution for unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with a good prospect </plain></SENT>
