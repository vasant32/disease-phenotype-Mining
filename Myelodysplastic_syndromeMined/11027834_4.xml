<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As underlying mechanisms, deregulated thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl)-mediated signaling pathways have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study therefore examined whether the impaired signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells includes alterations of c-mpl itself or postsignaling events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells from healthy donors, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were isolated by MACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of c-mpl cDNA was studied by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin dependent activation of STAT proteins and MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both splicing isoforms of c-mpl (c-mpl-p and c-mpl-k) were expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the CD34(+) cells examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the c-mpl cDNA revealed no sequence abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show c-mpl dependent activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 as well as MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) in CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cells derived from RA patients revealed low basal levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phosphorylation was enhanced by stimulation with recombinant thrombopoietin (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>STAT1 failed to be activated by <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF in CD34(+) cells from healthy donors as well as from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M7 the constitutive expression levels of STAT1, 3, 5, and MAPK were markedly upregulated, resulting in a strong activation of STAT3 and 5 by <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite its high expression, the level of MAPK phosphorylation was not increased in RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, and was completely undetectable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the defective megakaryopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not caused by a lack of c-mpl and that STAT3 and STAT5 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
