<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Israel, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (AZA) is routinely used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, infectious complications are common during AZA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study was aimed to evaluate the incidence and predisposing risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in AZA-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study included patients treated with AZA in 18 Israeli medical institutions between 2008 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on 184 patients [157 high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)], with a median age of 71.6 (range 29-92) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 153 infectious events were reported during 928 treatment cycles (16.5%) administered to 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred fourteen, 114/153 (75%) events required hospitalization and 30 (19.6%) were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, unfavorable cytogenetics, low neutrophil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) and platelet (PLT) counts were found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (24.4% vs. 12.9%, P &lt; 0.0001; 27% vs. 13.5%, P &lt; 0.0001; 20.4% vs. 11%, P &lt; 0.0001 and 29.2% vs. 14.2%, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only low Hb level, low PLT count, and unfavorable cytogenetics remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior to therapy, poor cytogenetics, PLT count below 20 × 10⁹/L and neutrophil count below 0.5 × 10⁹/L were predictive of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during the first two cycles of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, presenting with low neutrophil and PLT counts, are susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> risk should be repeated prior to each cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor cytogenetics in whom AZA is prescribed despite low PLT count are particularly at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> prophylaxis may be considered </plain></SENT>
