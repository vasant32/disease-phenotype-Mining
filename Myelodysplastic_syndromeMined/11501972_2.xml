<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The need for standardization criteria and result reproducibility in immunophenotyping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> has increased along with their clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group "Policentric Study Group on Immunological Markers", is composed of 40 laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its aim, over recent years, has been to find a standardized way of immunophenotypic analysis applicable to various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to contribute to the debate concerning standardization of monoclonal antibody panels and immunophenotypic analysis procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), with the following targets: to improve interlaboratory reproducibility of the immunophenotyping data, and interpretative results; to study, with improved feasibility, correlation between immunophenotype and clinical or biological findings on a large number of AL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases; to verify the utility of the proposed monoclonal antibody panels for proper AL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classification, and to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the field of AL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> our experience is based on about 1800 and 700 cases respectively analyzed over the last five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting from these experiences and data of the literature we have elaborated the proposed panels of monoclonal antibodies and the methods of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have suggested a standardized immunophenotypic approach to study AL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular our work has focused on the gating strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This aims at drawing a gate of analysis having high purity and recovery, and on the choice of monoclonal antibody combinations for multiparametric analysis, particularly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antigen expression on each step of lineage differentiation or their clinically relevant aberrant expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A standardized criteria has become a necessary starting point in any kind of analytical process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the field of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> the work of this polycentric group has focused on the pre-analytical and analytical steps to be taken in cytometric evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results obtained may contribute to reaching intra and inter-laboratory reproducibility </plain></SENT>
