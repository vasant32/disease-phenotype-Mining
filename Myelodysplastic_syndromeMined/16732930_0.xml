<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> received prophylactic GPBSCI after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of the 12 patients, two were Ph(+) ALL in CR(1), one ALL in CR(2), one refractory ALL, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (one in relapse, one refractory disease, one in CR(3)), four <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in advanced stage and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen infusions were performed in the 12 patients, including 5 infusions were performed within +90 days post-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD3(+) cells infused for GPBSCI before +90 d were 1.00 (0.95 - 1.24) x 10(8)/kg and 0.53 (0.39 - 0.63) x 10(8)/kg, and after +90 d were 2.27 (1.00 - 4.30) x 10(8)/kg and 1.15 (0.55 - 2.10) x 10(8)/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed grade I - II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, and one grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, of which four cases were extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had no transfusion related GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No transfusion related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients survived disease-freely at 563 (415 - 728) days of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse after GPBSCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT with prophylactic GPBSCI could maximize graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect with few fatal complications and might be a potentially curative strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> patients with high risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
