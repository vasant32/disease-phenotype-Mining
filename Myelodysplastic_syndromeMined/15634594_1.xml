<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi> and TRAIL at 9 different concentrations and the treated cells were detected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h for biologic indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same detections were conducted in untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assayed by flow cytometry after Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiation-induction effect of these drugs on the cells were detected by morphologic examination and CD34(+) proportion analysis after 24 hours treatment and further agar culture for 18 days; P15(ink4b) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were detected by RT-PCR and its protein expression by DAB immunocytochemistry, P15(ink4b) DNA methylation by methylation specific PCR (Msp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi>/TRAIL treatment promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi> plus TRAIL showed obvious differentiation-induction effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P15(ink4b) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cell line after different drug treatment but almost no protein expression increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased P15 expression seemed to be related with DNA demethylation effect of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi> or/and TRAIL treatment could promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the clonal cells and induce incomplete cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The drugs treatment could also increase P15(ink4b) expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cell line through their demethylation effects </plain></SENT>
