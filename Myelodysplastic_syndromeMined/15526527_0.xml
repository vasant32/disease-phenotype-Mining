<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (hMDS) appears to be a distinct clinicopathologic entity, accounting for about 15% from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogeny is supposed to result from immunosupressive mechanisms and some observations on successful treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case of a young female patient diagnosed by bone marrow core biopsy with hMDS - <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (FAB and WHO classification) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and scarce CD34(+) cells by immunohistophenotyping is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> followed by CsA for a few months and shortly after she developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (M4) which responded to low-doses of daily oral melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is one of the first few reports on such an event during the immunosuppressive therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the possible explanations for this unusual evolution are discussed </plain></SENT>
