<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the peripheral NK function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the peripheral NK cell population was quantitatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NK cells displayed an expression of the activating natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp46 and NKp30 as well as NKG2D similar to that observed in donors, but exert a highly decreased constitutive cytolytic activity compared to resting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although activation with IL-2 resulted in the upregulation of NKp46 expression by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-NK cells, their cytolytic function remained deeply altered as compared to activated donor NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> NK cells did not proliferate in vitro, and displayed an increased rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to IL-2 stimulation although the spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a proportion of peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-NK cells were derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone as the cytogenetic anomaly found in bone marrow karyotype was also detected in 20-50% of circulating NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NK cells' cytolytic function and proliferative capacities in response to activation by cytokines are profoundly altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
