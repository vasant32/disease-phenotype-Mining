<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By applying the immunocytochemical assay, we have demonstrated that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e>) in single cases in smear preparations from the peripheral blood as well as from the bone marrow P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-positive cells, respectively, cells with mdr-positive phenotype can be detected in the material obtained from patients before therapy and without clinically and anamnestically known exposure to cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group of probands without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and also without clinically or anamnestically confirmed contact with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs, we have found P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-positive subpopulations of cells with positive mdr phenotype in a few cases as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uniqueness of our results lies in the fact that this finding demonstrates the presence of subpopulations of mdr-positive cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> before therapy, and furthermore makes evident that a positive mdr phenotype is not necessarily associated with a malignant phenotype or a malignant cell transformation </plain></SENT>
