<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We and others have cloned a novel human gene CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBP-epsilon) encoding a member of the C/EBP gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is exclusively expressed in myeloid and T-lymphoid cells and appears to have an important role in inducing expression of several myeloid-specific genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to examine DNA from 93 hamster/human radiation hybrid clones in order chromosomally to map C/EBP-epsilon to 14q11.2 (between D14S264 and D14S275) which is telomeric to the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes and centromeric to several other myeloid gene products including Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Chymase-1 (CMA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether C/EBP-epsilon behaves as an altered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene, samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) evolving to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using microsatellite sequences that we identified within 0.2 kb of the amino-terminus of the human C/EBP-epsilon gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of the C/EBP-epsilon gene was detected in four out of 20 (20%) evolving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and in none of the 17 AML and 17 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the gene was performed using PCR-SSCP on 37 AML and 40 MDS cases including those with LOH at the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were found suggesting that the altered gene in this region is not C/EBP-epsilon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, C/EBP-epsilon was examined by Southern blot analysis on DNA samples from 20 AML patients and 10 AML cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No rearrangements or amplifications of the gene were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we have mapped C/EBP-epsilon to 14q11.2, a region containing other myeloid and T-lymphoid specific genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no structural alterations were detected in the C/EBP-epsilon gene </plain></SENT>
