<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological features of these cases were analyzed to determine the influence of age, secondary karyotype abnormalities, and expression of the lymphoid marker CD19 on event free survival, and presence of extramedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated with a variety of chemotherapy protocols and some had bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be no difference in survival between children (age &lt;17 years) and adults (age &gt;16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of the 50 cases, 16 (32%) had the (8;21) translocation alone, 17 (34%) had additional loss of a sex chromosome and the remaining 17 (34%) had other karyotype abnormalities of which deletion or translocation of the long arms of a #9 was most common (observed in 8 of the 17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The karyotype groups had a significant impact on survival, the group with loss of a sex chromosome having a poorer outcome and the group with abnormalities of chromosome 9 having a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD19 positivity was seen in 21 of the 33 cases (63%) in whom it was measured compared to 11% observed in controls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without a t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD19 status did not exert any influence on event free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extramedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (EML) occurred in 5 of the 50 cases (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient it was observed at diagnosis but in the others it presented concurrent with bone marrow relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of patients with EML was worse than that of the other patients but did not achieve statistical significance and was probably adversely affected by other factors </plain></SENT>
