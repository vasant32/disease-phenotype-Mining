<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of safety and efficacy of GM-CSF prior to and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in a low-dose, intermittent regimen for elderly patients with poor risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients, age 68 to 86 years, each received 250 microg/m2 of GM-CSF (Sargramostatin; Immunex, Seattle, WA, USA) subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.) for 3 days followed by GM-CSF at the same dose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 100 mg/m2 i.v. for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> were both administered for 3 days during weeks 2 and 3 followed by a 3-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of CR and PR were 20% and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
