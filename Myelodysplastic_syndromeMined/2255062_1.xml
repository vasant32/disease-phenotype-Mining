<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His peripheral leukocyte count was 3,000/microliters with 43% of granular lymphocytes (GL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These GLs were immunologically phenotyped as CD2+CD3-CD4-CD8-CD16+CD56+HLA-DR+ and were found that TcR genes coding beta and gamma chains were not rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis of his GLs stimulated with IL-2 showed 47 XY, +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient was diagnosed as a granular lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of natural killer cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood chemistry showed elevation of serum GOT, GPT and LDH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> persisted until administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was initiated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>47 XY, +8, that has been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, may be related to the pathogenesis in some cases of granular lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
