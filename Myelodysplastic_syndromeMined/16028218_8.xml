<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report the incidence of these chromosome changes in childhood myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> as 2%-4% based on the cytogenetic database of a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize precisely the types of 6q abnormalities in seven patients (six with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They carried various translocations involving different breakpoints in 6q, as confirmed by FISH using a whole-chromosome-6 paint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cases were reported as t(6;11), although the breakpoints varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, we identified a novel translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetic studies using the PAC clone RP5-1173K1 localized the genomic breakpoint on chromosome 11 to within the NUP98 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on chromosome 6 was narrowed down to a 500-kb region between BAC clones RP11-721P14 and RP11-39H10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reverse-transcription PCR was performed using a forward primer specific for NUP98 and a reverse primer for the candidate gene in the 500-kb interval in 6q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This experiment resulted in the identification of a new fusion between NUP98 and C6orf80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies will aim to fully characterize C6orf80 and will elucidate the role of this new NUP98 fusion in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
