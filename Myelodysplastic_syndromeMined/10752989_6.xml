<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic drugs are mostly used in patients at high risk for thrombotic complications, while their use is still debated in low risk patients because of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) and 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to our experience the use of more than one cytotoxic agent in ET confirms the increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, none of the patients treated with HU alone, even for more than 10 years (12 cases) developed AL </plain></SENT>
