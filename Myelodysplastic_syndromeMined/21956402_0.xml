<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The proposed MD Anderson Risk Model Score (MDAS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) refines outcome discrimination compared with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied the MDAS to Moffitt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (MCC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to validate its prognostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, as defined by World Health Organization criteria, from the Moffitt database, with confirmatory chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 775 patients evaluated between January 2001 and December 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were reclassified by MDAS as low (20.6%), intermediate-1 (31%), intermediate-2 (21%), high risk (16.1%), and unknown (11.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis was 92, 49, 27, and 14 months for low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk MDAS groups, respectively (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median OS from referral was 61, 28, 15, and 8 months (P &lt; .005), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 484 patients classified by IPSS as low or intermediate-1 risk, 25% were up-staged as intermediate-2 or high risk by MDAS; 4 prognostically distinct subgroups were identified among lower risk IPSS categories with median OS of 93, 53, 31, and 18 months (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 201 intermediate-2 or high-risk IPSS patients, 15.4% were down-staged to intermediate-1 by MDAS, with 3 groups identified by MDAS having median OS of 33, 23, and 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformation rate was highest among high-risk MDAS (50.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, higher risk MDAS predicted inferior OS (hazard ratio 1.42; P &lt; .005) independent of IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data validated MDAS' prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MDAS is complementary to IPSS and refines prognostic precision </plain></SENT>
