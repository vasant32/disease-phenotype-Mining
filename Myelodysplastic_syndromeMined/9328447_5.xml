<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) is a nuclear protein expressed specifically in developing cells of the human myelomonocytic lineage, including the end-stage monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear localization, lineage- and stage-specific expression, association with chromatin, and regulation by interferon alpha indicate that this protein is involved in regulating gene expression uniquely associated with the differentiation process and/or function of the monocyte/macrophage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MNDA does not bind specific DNA sequences, but rather a set of nuclear proteins that includes nucleolin (C23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation were used to demonstrate that MNDA also binds protein B23 (nucleophosmin/NPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three reciprocal chromosome translocations found in certain cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involve fusions with the NPM/B23 gene, t(5;17) NPM-RARalpha, t(2;5) NPM-ALK, and the t(3;5) NPM-MLF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the current study, MNDA was not able to bind the NPM-ALK chimera originating from the t(2;5) and containing residues 1-117 of NPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, MNDA did bind the NPM-MLF1 product of the t(3;5) that contains the N-terminal 175 residues of NPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional 58 amino acids (amino acids 117-175) of the NPM sequence that are contained in the product of the NPM-MLF1 fusion gene relative to the product of the NPM-ALK fusion appear responsible for MNDA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This additional NPM sequence contains a nuclear localization signal and clusters of acidic residues believed to bind nuclear localization signals of other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas NPM and nucleolin are primarily localized within the nucleolus, MNDA is distributed throughout the nucleus including the nucleolus, suggesting that additional interactions define overall MNDA localization </plain></SENT>
