<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clonality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has been studied with various techniques including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) isoenzyme and cytogenetic analyses, and with molecular techniques such as gene deletion studies and the analysis of restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLP) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome-specific probe to examine cytogenetic clonality in peripheral blood (PB) cells from three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was shown by conventional cytogenetic analysis at the time of the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using FISH with a probe for the centromere of chromosome 8, we identified the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in individual PB cells from Wright-stained smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this technique, we could determine the cell lineage involved by the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>, and through serial analyses we could assess the response of the clonal and nonclonal cells to growth-factor therapy, and the expansion of the trisomic clone over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each of the three cases, various proportions of granulocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In none of the cases did we detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By analysis of PB cells before and during therapy with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we found that GM-CSF stimulated both trisomic and disomic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a 1-year period of sequential study, we detected an abrupt increase in the percentage of trisomic cells in one patient, a stable percentage in another, and a slowly increasing percentage in the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abrupt increase in the first patient preceded a transformation to a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase by 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FISH analysis of PB cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> offers an additional approach to the study of clonality in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In some cases this analysis may provide a useful and simple means of assessing response to therapy and progression of disease </plain></SENT>
