<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) often require treatment with growth factors (GFs) or non-GF therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One non-GF drug, lenalidomide, is particularly effective at achieving transfusion independence (TI) in patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with the del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, approximately half of del(5q) patients and one quarter of non-del(5q) patients treated with lenalidomide experience significant cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide-induced cytopenias occurring early in treatment may serve as a surrogate marker of clonal suppression and, therefore, may be predictive of a TI response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 362 low-risk, transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with or without the del(5q) abnormality, enrolled in two phase II studies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-003 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-002) to determine whether treatment-related cytopenias are correlated with lenalidomide response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytopenias were assessed during the first 8 weeks of therapy, and response was defined as TI; response predictors were explored in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with del(5q), 70% of those whose platelet count decreased by &gt; or = 50% achieved TI, as compared with 42% of those whose platelet count remained stable or declined by less than 50% (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients without baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, 82% of those whose absolute neutrophil count (ANC) decreased by &gt; or = 75% achieved TI, as compared with 51% whose ANC remained stable or decreased by less than 75% (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relationships were consistent in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No relationship between the development of cytopenias and response could be established for lower-risk patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that a direct cytotoxic effect of lenalidomide specific to the del(5q) clone may be indicative of a TI response </plain></SENT>
