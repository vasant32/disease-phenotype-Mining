<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CPX-351 induction was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion to 48 relapsed or refractory patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doses started at 3 units/m(2) with dose doublings in single-patient cohorts until a pharmacodynamic effect (treatment-related adverse events or reduction in bone marrow cellularity or blast count) was observed, followed by 33% escalations in three patient cohorts until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose was 101 units/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DLTs consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100735'>hypertensive crisis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and prolonged cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were consistent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response occurred at doses as low as 32 units/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 43 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, nine had complete response (CR) and one had CR with incomplete platelet recovery; of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, one of three had CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight CRs were achieved among the 31 patients with prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> occurred in five of 26 patients age â‰¥ 60 years and in five of 17 patients younger than age 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median half-life was 31.1 hours (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) and 21.9 hours (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>), with both drugs and their metabolites detectable &gt; 7 days after the last dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The targeted 5:1 molar ratio was maintained at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels for up to 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The recommended dose of CPX-351 for phase II study is 101 units/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further exploration of efficacy and safety is ongoing in phase II trials in newly diagnosed and first-relapse patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
