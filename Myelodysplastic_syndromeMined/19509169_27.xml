<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> have been approved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDIs</z:chebi>) including vorinostat, romidepsin, panobinostat, belinostat, and entinostat have been shown to be active in cutaneous and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in which monotherapy with DNMT inhibitors or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDIs</z:chebi> are effective has been limited to date, the possibility remains that a broader spectrum of activity will be identified as combination studies are completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, basic science has provided a steadily increasing understanding of the complexity of the epigenome, including the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> code and triggers for aberrant methylation, and their contribution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As our basic understanding of the epigenetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> increases, the number of potential therapeutic targets will also increase, offering more hope in the quest to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by normalizing the epigenome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This issue of CCR Focus is dedicated to understanding the clinical and translational aspects of epigenetics research </plain></SENT>
