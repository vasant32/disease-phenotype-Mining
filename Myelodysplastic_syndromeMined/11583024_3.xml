<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the role of the Epo-R mediated signalling in the rise of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and whether alteration of signalling pathways contribute to the leukeamogenesis from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed Epo and GM-CSF induced ERK1/2 activation, c-Fos expression, STAT-5 and AP-1 DNA binding activities in mononuclear cells of umbilical cord blood (UCBMNC), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow (NBMMNC) or marrow with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In UCBMNC and NBMMNC, Epo and GM-CSF induced the activation of STAT-5 DNA binding and ERK 1/2 activation (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA, both signalling pathways were activated only by GM-CSF but not by Epo (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, elevated basal activity of STAT-5 DNA binding appeared in 8/8 cases, which was independent of Epo or GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples, c-Fos and Egr-1 proteins were not detectable and the expression levels were not increased by Epo or GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found an elevated level of c-Fos expression in 5/8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cases, which was not further increased in the presence of Epo or GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevated c-Fos expression was accompanied by an extremely high blast number in 5/5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that impaired ERK/MAPK activation, similarly to impaired STAT-5 activation in Epo-R signalling, may be responsible for the apoptotic process and the block of maturation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that the appearance of the constitutively activated STAT-5 DNA binding and c-Fos expression may be used as a predictor of the blastic transformation </plain></SENT>
