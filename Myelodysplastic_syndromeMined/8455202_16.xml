<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports have documented the occurrence of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following therapy with epipodophyllotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These reports have led to growing concern among oncologists, which could lead to premature abandonment of these agents at a time when the relationship between cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxin and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e> has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Because of the increasingly important role of epipodophyllotoxins in the treatment of several types of adult and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric tumors</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI) has developed a monitoring plan to obtain reliable estimates of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e> following epipodophyllotoxin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 12 NCI-supported Cooperative Group clinical trials in which patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> are being treated with epipodophyllotoxins at different cumulative doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One trial is using a moderate dose of teniposide (900 mg/m2), and 11 trials are using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> at a low dose (&lt; 1500 mg/m2), a moderate dose (1500-3999 mg/m2), or a high dose (&gt; or = 4000 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e> and treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (hereafter referred to as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) occurring in these trials are reported to CTEP, with initial analysis for each cumulative dose group triggered by the reporting of four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in that group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each analysis, total patient follow-up for the group is determined and cumulative 6-year incidence rate is calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e> and one case of treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (with documented <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7) were reported in a group of 207 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> at a low cumulative dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calculated 6-year rate of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 3.2% (95% upper confidence interval bounded by 7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 6-year cumulative rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (3.2%) is within the range previously reported for alkylator-based regimens that did not include epipodophyllotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Previous reports have suggested that higher cumulative doses of alkylators are associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>, and a critical goal of the monitoring plan is to determine whether a similar relationship exists for the epipodophyllotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Estimates will be developed for leukemogenic risk for the moderate- and high-cumulative-dose groups when four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been identified within each group </plain></SENT>
