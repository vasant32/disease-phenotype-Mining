<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy given by conventional doses and schedules generally produces complete remissions in 10% to 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine 1) whether a combination of dibromodulcitol, Adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>, Halotestin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with leucovorin rescue (DAVTHML) can produce a complete remission rate of 50%; and 2) the toxicity of this combination in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with six 28-day cycles of DAVTHML induction chemotherapy consisting of dibromodulcitol, 135 mg/m2 perorally days 1 to 10; Adriamycin 45 mg/m2 intravenously day 1; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, 2 mg intravenously day 1; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> and Halotestin, 20 mg perorally daily; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, 800 mg/m2 intravenously days 15 and 22; and leucovorin, 15 mg/m2 perorally every 6 hours for 9 doses, starting 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After induction, patients who had stable disease or a partial response were treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based regimen (CMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in complete remission were treated with three additional cycles of DAVTHML after achieving complete remission and then observed off therapy until relapse, when DAVTHML was to be given again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During induction, 26% of eligible patients experienced a complete remission; overall response rate was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to treatment failure and the median survival time of eligible patients was 11.1 and 24.0 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This did not change significantly when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were included in the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 37% and 11%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the eligible patients experienced grade III or IV toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (20%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No lethal toxicity was documented during therapy; however, 1 patient later died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> induced by dibromodulcitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall response and complete remission rates from our study were encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of DAVTHML was tolerable, with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> from dibromodulcitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The concept of using mid-cycle nonmyelosuppressant agents to increase complete remission rate is feasible </plain></SENT>
