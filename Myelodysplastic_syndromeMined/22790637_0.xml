<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination showed hypercellular bone marrow accompanied by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and the karyotype of his bone marrow cells was 46,XY, der(5;12)(q10;q10), +mar,inc[3]/46,XY[12] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, unclassifiable, was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of major BCR/ABL1 chimeric <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by real-time polymerase chain reaction method was positive, and then Ph chromosome was observed afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His Ph chromosome was seen in der(5;12)-negative cells analyzed by FISH, which suggested the late-appearing Ph chromosome evolved into another clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, he died due to respiratory dysfunction 5 months after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autopsy revealed massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infiltration</z:e> by Ph-negative cells, suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the late appearance of Ph chromosome associates with leukemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of late-appearing Ph chromosome is estimated to be relatively low, further accumulation of cases is necessary for the evaluation of its impact on prognosis and disease progression </plain></SENT>
