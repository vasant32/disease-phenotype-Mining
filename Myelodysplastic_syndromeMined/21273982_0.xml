<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> affects patients predominantly over 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As these syndromes are not well understood by many medical practitioner, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be underrecognized or underdiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The availability of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treatment options further establishes the need to more closely assess gaps in clinical practice and underscores the necessity to develop educational activities to address those gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel was convened to examine current educational needs and gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group consensus approach incorporating a modified nominal group technique was utilized to prioritize and review needs identified in the pre-meeting survey and to evaluate data provided by panelists prior to the meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The panel identified and prioritized seven educational areas of need: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease awareness, (2) diagnosis, (3) classification and risk stratification, (4) treatment issues, (5) referral to stem cell transplantation or new treatment protocols, (6) clinical monitoring and toxicity management, and (7) translation of new data into patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In-depth knowledge is critical to the timely diagnosis and optimal care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A number of key educational needs exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Educational programs should be practical in orientation to integrate data into practice, and they should be tailored for the intended audience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, an effective educational program must be easily applied by participants </plain></SENT>
