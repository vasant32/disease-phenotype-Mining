<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the de novo appearance of balanced translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients during the progression of the disease is rarely reported and the significance of the balanced translocation remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the first case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt), in which a new chromosomal translocation, t(7;13)(q10;q33) appeared de novo in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been revealed that rearrangements and deletions of chromosome 7, i.e. der(1;7)(q10;p10), are very complex and that multiple regions may contribute to the disease phenotype and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests that the chromosomal region at 7q10, rather than 1p10, might be one of the hot spots for myeloid proliferative disorders, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
