<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L3MBTL is highly homologous to the D-lethal(3) malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> [D-l(3)mbt] gene, which is a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene (TSG) identified in Drosophila and which is closely related to the Drosophila sex combs on midleg (SCM) protein, a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of transcriptional repressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine whether L3MBTL functions as a "classic" TSG in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, we screened a panel of 17 myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines and peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 29 MDS and 13 MPD patients for mutations in the entire L3MBTL coding sequence, including intron/exon splice junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified, although two single nucleotide differences were found (in intron 14 and in exon 15), which were interpreted as polymorphic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used real-time RT-PCR to quantify the level of L3MBTL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in various <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid and lymphoid cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>L3MBTL is expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ bone marrow cells, and we found that the pattern of L3MBTL expression was similar to that of BMI1, a well-studied PcG gene with oncogenic activity, suggesting that L3MBTL and BMI1 may be co-regulated during hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of L3MBTL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 30 of 35 cell lines and 13 of 15 AML samples was comparable to the level of L3MBTL expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines showed no L3MBTL expression, and two of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples showed aberrant L3MBTL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that L3MBTL is not mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, given the known dosage effects of PcG proteins in regulating gene expression, reduced or absent L3MBTL expression may be relevant in some cases of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
