<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latency from treatment to diagnosis of MN ranged from 9 to 384 months, with a median of 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 37 cases with cytogenetic studies, complex abnormalities were detected in 22 (59.5%), -5(q)/-7(q) in 4 (10.8%), other abnormalities in 8 (21.6%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in 3 (8.1%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex abnormalities and -5(q)/-7(q) correlated directly with multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, particularly with combined melphalan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the features of cytogenetic abnormalities in our series were significantly different from those with concomitant PCM/MN who had significantly lower complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latency, skewed proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and bias toward complex cytogenetic abnormalities/unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5/7 suggested an alkylating mutagenic effect on pathogenesis of secondary MN </plain></SENT>
