<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrent deletions, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), may be indicative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene nearby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with 7q-, in order to define the commonly deleted area in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Separated blood lymphocytes and granulocytes were typed with 48 polymorphic microsatellite markers, and the heterozygosity between the two cell lineages was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minimum commonly deleted region spanned from D7S658 to D7S655 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, four of the patients showed remarkable homozygosity in both lymphocytes and granulocytes around the commonly deleted area, and thus no deletions could be demonstrated by comparing the two cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison to leukemic patients without 7q- and to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals revealed that the homozygosity was restricted to patients with 7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a specific mechanism, such as mitotic recombination in bone marrow stem cells, leading to homozygosity in both granulocytes and lymphocytes, represents a leukemogenetic step in these patients </plain></SENT>
