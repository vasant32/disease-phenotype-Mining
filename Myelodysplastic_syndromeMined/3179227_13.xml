<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival was poor with a median of 15 months, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> being responsible for the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
