<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This agent is also currently under active investigation for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), as well as in drug combinations for some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although treatment with lenalidomide has translated into a significant extension in overall survival in MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and has superior safety and efficacy relative to thalidomide, the mechanism of action as it relates to immune modulation remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on preclinical models and clinical trials, lenalidomide, as well as other structural thalidomide derivatives, enhances the proliferative and functional capacity of T-lymphocytes and amplifies costimulatory signaling pathways that activate effector responses and suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes our current understanding of T- and natural killer (NK) cell pathways that are modified by lenalidomide in hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> to inform future decisions about potential combination therapies </plain></SENT>
