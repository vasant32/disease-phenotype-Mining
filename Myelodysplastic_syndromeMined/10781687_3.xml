<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if AMF also produced a direct effect on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, we planned a study to evaluate the effect of a continuous exposure to AMF on a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AMF was shown to have a growth-inhibitory effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, with an IC(50) of 14 microM after a 5 day exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis revealed that a 5 day exposure to 20 microM AMF increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and this was accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytoflorometric and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>-gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that this effect correlated with cell membrane alterations and DNA fragmentation consistent with an induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> without affecting the expression of p53 protein or inducing any lymphoid or myeloid differentiation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the continuous exposure of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line to AMF is cytotoxic and associated with an induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> independent of alterations in p53 expression </plain></SENT>
