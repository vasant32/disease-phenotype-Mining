<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms of the defective response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we examined expression levels of GM-CSF receptor alpha (GMR alpha) and common beta (beta c) subunits on CD16(+) neutrophils, CD14(+) monocytes and CD3(+) T cells from 26 MDS patients and 10 healthy controls using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of GMR alpha was significantly decreased on the neutrophils of five out of 26 patients and was not specific for any FAB subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, beta c expression on neutrophils was significantly reduced in 14 out of 26 patients with a higher proportion occurring in the advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> including refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt) and overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> compared with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA)/RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased beta c also correlated with the degree of hypogranular neutrophil <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of both subunits on T cells and monocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolated from the affected neutrophils suggests that the reduction of beta c may result from decreased message levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed reduction in GM-CSF receptor expression could account for the impaired proliferative and maturational responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
