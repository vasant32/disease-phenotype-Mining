<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the conventional plasma iron turnover of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients increased with plasma iron levels after multiple blood transfusions, erythron transferrin uptake was chosen as a parameter of erythroid marrow activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a correlation was shown between plasma iron level and plasma iron turnover (r = 0.50, 0.01 less than p less than 0.02), no correlation existed between the plasma iron level and erythron transferrin uptake (r = 0.25, p greater than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythron transferrin uptake, independent of plasma iron, was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (110.6 +/- 67.6 and 67.6 +/- 18.8 mumol/l/dl, respectively; 0.01 less than p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increased erythropoiesis occurring concomitantly with morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased erythroid cellularity was demonstrated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurement of erythron transferrin uptake might be valuable as an accurate expression of erythroid activity in the hyperferremic state </plain></SENT>
