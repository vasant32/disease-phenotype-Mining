<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of 91 younger patients (median age 44 years with female prevalence) are reported and compared with elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequent karyotypic changes were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (9.8%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had occupational exposure to potential <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and solvents), with a male predominance, higher frequency of refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) (52%) and higher frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (21.7%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable factors for overall survival were: age &gt; 40 years, &gt; 5% of blasts, trilinear bone marrow involvement and intermediate-high World Health Organization Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be identified as a distinct subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients belonging to the low/intermediate-I risk group, due to a low transformation rate, aggressive approaches should rarely be recommended </plain></SENT>
