<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biological response to TNF requires interaction with specific cell membrane receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular domains of these receptors are released into body fluids as soluble molecules, and participate in the bioactivity of TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of p55 and p75 soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptors (sTNFR) were determined in 34 patients with different diseases who underwent BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential studies initiated 10 days before BMT and continued up to 110 days post-transplantation showed that p55 and p75 sTNFR levels were elevated significantly in patients who subsequently developed major transplant-related complications (TRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both sTNFR levels were increased 2- to 3-fold over control values during post-BMT febrile periods in those patients who at a later stage suffered major TRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the serum level of sTNFR may be used as a prognostic marker for major TRC in BMT </plain></SENT>
