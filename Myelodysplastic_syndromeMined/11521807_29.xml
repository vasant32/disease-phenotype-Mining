<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thalidomide, as a single agent, has been recently found to induce a clinical response in one third of refractory or relapsed <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that thalidomide significantly inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>. it is still unclear whether its clinical effect is mediated, at least in part, by its anti-angiogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated thalidomide as a single agent in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath>, i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp>, and measured prospectively a number of surrogate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical responses were observed in 7 of 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and 2 of 5 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> patient had a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of the best clinical response, plasma levels of angiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), were significantly decreased, and flow cytometry indicated a decrease of activated endothelial cells in the bone marrow of responding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations confirm thalidomide efficacy in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, suggest a possible use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> and may contribute to the prediction of clinical response and to understanding the mechanism of thalidomide's action </plain></SENT>
