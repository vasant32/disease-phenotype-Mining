<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively examined the medical records of 321 (229 females, 92 males) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-one (53.3%) patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When evaluating the clinical features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 321 patients were included; however, when the response to treatment modalities was evaluated only 150 patients followed up regularly were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients on initial diagnosis was 34 years (range: 14-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At initial diagnosis, 235 (73.2%) patients had signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of patients diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> initially, six later turned out to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of 150 patients followed up regularly was 30 months (range: 4-396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-seven of these subjects had an indication for treatment and 94.2% of them were administered either standard or high-dose steroids as the first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was defined as any platelet count &gt;100,000/mm(3) lasting for 3 months or longer without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CR was achieved in 51.9% of the patients given steroids as the initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 33 months, relapse occurred in 58.2% of these patients, and after a median follow-up of 11 months the rest of them were still in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight patients followed up regularly were administered second-line therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CR was obtained in 44.4% of the patients who used steroids as second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Within a median follow-up of 15 months, 20.8% of these patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was performed in 76 patients and CR was obtained in 68.4% of the regularly followed up patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred within a median of 96 months in 15.4% of the patients who had CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the duration of CR obtained by splenectomy was significantly higher than that obtained by steroids (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The 10-year disease-free survivals in patients who used steroids and who underwent splenectomy were, respectively, 13% and 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In our adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, steroids induced nearly similar rates of CR both as first-and second-line therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy seems to be effective in patients unresponsive to steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The duration of CR obtained by splenectomy is significantly longer when compared with the duration of CR obtained by steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
