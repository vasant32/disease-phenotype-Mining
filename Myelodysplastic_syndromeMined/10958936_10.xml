<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-microdissection probes specific for 6p21 and 6p25, we observed five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and two patients with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> to have 6p <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39054">NTAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data and those in the literature, it is possible to divide 6p <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39054">NTAs</z:chebi> into the following three groups in MHD: The first group presents with 6p <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39054">NTAs</z:chebi> as a sole or primary change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are only two cases reported in this group, including one case with del(6)(p23) and the present case with ins(6)(q23p23p25) identified by FISH only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second group presents with 6p deletions as a sole or primary change in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases have been reported in this group, including one case with del(6)(p21p23), one with del(6)(p21), and the present case 2 with del(6)(p21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third group has 6p deletions in addition to other known primary changes, present in both myeloid and lymphoid disorders, with 36 cases reported, including five cases from our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletions involving 6p21, 6p22, or 6p23 have been observed in both myeloid and lymphoid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present data provide cogent information for further molecular characterization of 6p anomalies in MHD </plain></SENT>
