<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify whether a target cell of leukemic transformation in AMkL is a cell committed to megakaryocytic lineage, or a multipotential stem cell, we examined AMkL patients with regard to: a) the presence of myelodyplastic features in residual erythroid and granulocytic cells, b) coexistence of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive blasts with megakaryoblasts, and c) the presence of the same chromosomal abnormality in erythroid and granuloid colony-forming cells as seen in megakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding the former two items, results were compared with those from megakaryoblastic crisis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-MkBC) and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (DS-TMD), which are thought to be multipotential stem cell disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients with AMkL, three, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, had marked myelodysplastic changes of erythroid series and/or granulocytic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 out of 7 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-MkBC, 5 out of 8 patients with DS-TMD, and 7 out of 18 patients with AMkL, MPO-positive blasts, even though rare, were observed in addition to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53262">PPO</z:chebi>-positive blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one of these patients with AMkL also showed complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case of AMkL with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, chromosomal analysis of cultured cells of individual colonies revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analysable metaphases from both CFU-GM and BFU-E had the same chromosomal abnormality as megakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has clarified that a considerable proportion of AMkL cases, particularly those with complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> or showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, arise against the background of a multipotential stem cell disorder, even if blasts are exclusively megakaryocytic in phenotype </plain></SENT>
