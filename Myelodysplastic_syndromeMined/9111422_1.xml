<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1972 to 1992, 1045 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> were assessed and treated at the Department of Radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, the Institute of Radiology, and the Department of Human Biopathology, Hematology Section, University of Rome "La Sapienza" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 72 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a more accurate calculation of the risk of ANLL occurrence, the patients were first divided into three subgroups according to initial treatment and then according to the total treatment they had received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to establish the probable connection between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and splenic treatment the patients were also divided into three subgroups (splenectomy, splenic irradiation, and no splenectomy/no splenic irradiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases of ANLL were recorded, giving an overall risk of 0.2% at 5 years and 3.4% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was preceded by a myelodys-plastic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five cases had evaluable chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were demonstrated in two patients, whereas three patients showed an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow agar cultures were analyzed in two patients and were abnormal in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the radiotherapy (RT) group, the cumulative risk was 0.4% at 10 years and 3.2% at 15 and 20 years: in the chemotherapy (CT) group it was 1.2% at 10, 15, and 20 years; in the combined group it was 3.7% at 10 years and 4.9% at 15 and 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, MOPP treatment with or without RT is a statistically significant variable for ANLL occurrence (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that splenic treatment does not lead to ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MOPP alone and with MOPP plus RT can increase the risk of ANLL </plain></SENT>
