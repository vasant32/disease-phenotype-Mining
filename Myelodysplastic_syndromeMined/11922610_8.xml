<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the EVI1 gene at 3q26 is transcriptionally activated in 3q21q26 syndrome, we assessed the role of EVI1 gene expression in the abnormal megakaryocytic differentiation in 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis of various types of hematopoietic cells revealed that the EVI1 gene is expressed specifically in CD34(+) cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UT-7 is a human immature megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line with dependence for the growth on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (designated at UT-7/GM) and with a differentiation capacity to erythroid (UT-7/EPO) and megakaryocytic lineages (UT-7/TPO) by erythropoietin (EPO) and thrombopoietin (TPO), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among three UT-7 sublines, UT-7/GM, UT-7/EPO, and UT-7/TPO, expression of the EVI1 gene was detected at low levels in UT-7/GM and UT-7/EPO cells, but was detected at a higher level in UT-7/TPO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When UT-7/GM cells were cultured with TPO, the level of EVI1 expression was increased, along with increased numbers of polynuclear megakaryocytes and expression of the platelet factor 4 (PF-4) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, forced expression of the EVI1 gene in UT-7/GM cells changed their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> to polynuclear megakaryocytes, stopped their growth, and induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that expression of the EVI1 gene is involved in progression of megakaryocytic differentiation and, thus, the dysmegakaryocytopoiesis in 3q21q26 syndrome could be partly due to an enhanced differentiation capacity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells and/or megakaryocytes by constitutive expression of the EVI1 gene </plain></SENT>
