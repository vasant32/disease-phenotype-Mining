<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of donor- and/or host-specific gene sequences provides a rapid and highly sensitive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the characterization and application of PCR for the amplification of Y-chromosome-specific DNA in blood cells recovered from stored slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four different primer pair combinations were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR can be rapidly performed on stained or unstained slide material with varying sensitivity--depending on the primer combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lowest limit of detection is one male cell in 500-1000 female cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique was applied to follow the early post-transplant course of 15 male patients who received grafts from female donors and found a high incidence of mixed chimerism during the first three months after BMT and a striking fluctuation between positive and negative results in the follow-up of individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PCR for the detection of male-specific DNA sequences can be successfully performed with high sensitivity on material recovered from stored blood slides </plain></SENT>
