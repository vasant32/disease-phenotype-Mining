<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy and toxicity of clofarabine-based chemotherapy followed by RIC and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for high-risk, relapsed, or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From May 2007 until October 2009, a total of 27 patients underwent allogeneic SCT after treatment with clofarabine and ara-C for 5d and RIC (4Gy TBI/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unmanipulated G-CSF mobilized PBSC (n=26) or bone marrow cells (n=1) were transplanted from unrelated (n=21) or matched related (n=6) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-hematological toxicities of this regimen mainly affected liver and skin and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients relapsed within a median time of 5.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival rates were 56% and 52% at 2 yr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of patients, cytoreduction with clofarabine/ara-C (ClAraC) followed by RIC allogeneic SCT was well tolerated and showed good antileukemic efficacy even in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with engraftment and GvHD-incidence comparable to other RIC regimens </plain></SENT>
