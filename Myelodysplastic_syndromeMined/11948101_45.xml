<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Phase I study demonstrated promising preliminary evidence of clinical activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; however, plasma concentrations achieved at the maximum tolerated dose were less than those targeted based on in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because prolonged exposure to suboptimal concentrations of PB in vitro led to pharmacodynamic changes similar to a more brief exposure to higher concentrations, a study of the feasibility of prolonged administration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> PB was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> PB as a continuous i.v. infusion via ambulatory infusion pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential cohorts were treated for 7 consecutive days out of 14 or with 21 consecutive days out of 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prolonged infusions were well tolerated; dose-limiting central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system toxicity developed in 1 of 23 patients treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End-of-infusion plasma concentrations were maintained within a range sufficient to inhibit HDAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients on the 21/28 schedule developed hematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged infusions of PB are well tolerated making this an attractive platform for the clinical investigation of HDAC inhibition </plain></SENT>
