<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was administered various common tranquilizers until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was noted 10 months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A routine autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain weighed 1365 g, and macroscopic observation revealed no remarkable findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, microscopic examination disclosed cells with enlarged and basophilic nuclei, and unusual astrocytes in the demyelinated foci, especially at the corticomedullary junctions in the temporal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the white matter was relatively intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-JC virus protein, VP-1 antibody, demonstrated JC virus-infected cells in not only abnormal glial cells and neurons but also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-looking cells, which are suggestive of progressive multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (PML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for GFAP revealed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and some scattered abnormal enlarged nuclear cells in the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some clusters of CD8-positive lymphocytes were seen, which kill infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PML could be considered a short-term disease preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as "incidental PML" in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is a rare autopsy case of early PML occurring in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patient with PML </plain></SENT>
