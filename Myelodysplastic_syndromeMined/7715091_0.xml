<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the platelet count was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05), and the blast percentage of the bone marrow was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TMDS group than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/non-TMDS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sex ratio, age, WBC and RBC count did not significantly differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunological markers and the myeloperoxidase positivity of the blasts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TMDS varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was 66.7% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TMDS group and 83.3% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/non-TMDS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic changes were still detected in the bone marrow smears in 7 of 8 AML/TMDS cases who achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TMDS group showed significantly shorter CR duration (median; 169 days) and survival (median; 511 days, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in two cases which underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) during early relapse phase the disease-free survival has extended over 4 years and 2 years 8 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we would like to propose that allo-BMT should be performed as early as possible to overcome poor outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TMDS </plain></SENT>
