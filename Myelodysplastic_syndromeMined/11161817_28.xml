<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we defined a commonly deleted segment (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e>) of 1.5 Mb between D5S479 and D5S500 in patients with a del(5q), and we established a P1 artificial chromosome-based contig encompassing this interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (TSGs), we developed a transcript map of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The map contains 18 genes and 12 expressed sequence tags/UniGenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 genes are 10 genes that were previously cloned and 8 novel genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The newly identified genes include CDC23, which encodes a component of the anaphase-promoting complex; RAB6KIFL, which encodes a kinesin-like protein involved in organelle transport; and KLHL3, which encodes a human homologue of the Drosophila ring canal protein, kelch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined the intron/exon organization of 14 genes and eliminated each gene as a classical TSG by mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we established a single-nucleotide polymorphism map as well as a map of the mouse genome that is syntenic to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> of human 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of a transcription map will facilitate the molecular cloning of a myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suppressor gene on 5q </plain></SENT>
