<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to assess the reliability of these indices in the differentiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 134 thrombocytopenic patients (69 men, 65 women) who were divided into two groups according to the underlying disease: group I (n = 63) included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, whereas group II (n = 71) included patients with HT due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> secondary to chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet indices were derived from a Sysmex automated cell counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive prognostic value, negative prognostic value, efficiency and Youden index were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concerning MPV and PDW indices, sensitivity, specificity, positive prognostic value, negative prognostic value, efficiency and Youden index were 100% for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the values for P-LCR were significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MPV and PDW can be safely relied on for a positive diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MPV and PDW were superior to P-LCR </plain></SENT>
