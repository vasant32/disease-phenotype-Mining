<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed early, durable engraftment, and no serious toxicities were observed apart from grade III mucositis in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in two cases, which was well-controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one ATL patient whose donor did not have NIMA microchimerism, tacrolimus could not be continued after engraftment due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (gut: stage 4) occurred on day 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was free from disease (requiring no transfusions and with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow) for 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases of ATL relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Feto-maternal tolerance may lead to new RIST strategies in the haploidentical reduced-intensity situation, but further evaluation is required </plain></SENT>
