<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though mutations have been shown to occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a notable proportion of these affect genes involved in epigenetic maintenance, suggesting a dominant role of epigenomic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant DNA methylation is the dominant and most well-studied epigenetic alteration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various genes, including cell cycle regulators, apoptotic genes, and DNA repair genes, are epigenetically silenced and have roles in pathogenesis and transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The involvement of these genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathophysiology and prognosis is reviewed and reveals distinct methylation patterns between high- and low-risk subsets of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors azacitdine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> are approved for treatment even though the optimal dosing strategies are still being developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the mechanisms of action of these agents in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and show that demethylation may not correlate well with their efficacy, thus suggesting alternative modes of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also show that DNMT inhibitors may have potent anti-leukemic stem cell effects at lower doses and also review the mechanisms of resistance to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these studies show that even though DNA methylation has been studied extensively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, its role in prognosis and response to therapy is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of deep sequencing and genome-wide methylome analysis will potentially uncover prognostic signatures and reveal the complexity of epigenetic dysregulation in this disease </plain></SENT>
