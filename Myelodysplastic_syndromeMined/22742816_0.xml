<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation of Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> genes was associated with activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, consistent with the up-regulation of the Wnt downstream genes TCF1 and LEF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> exposure induced demethylation of Wnt-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gene promoters and reduction of the non-phosphorylated β-catenin (NPBC) which is prevalent during Wnt pathway inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of ≥5% of bone marrow blasts was associated with methylation of sFRP1 and DKK1 and with methylation of more than two of the five Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
