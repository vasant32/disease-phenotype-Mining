<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to improve these cytopenias we have treated 18 patients over a 6- to 8-week period with increasing daily subcutaneous doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients responded with improvement in neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On cessation of treatment these counts returned to baseline values over a 2- to 4-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To maintain these improved blood counts 11 patients were treated with G-CSF for more prolonged periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients again responded with an increase in total leukocyte counts (1.6- to 6.4-fold) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) (3.6- to 16.3-fold), with responses persisting for 3 to 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly decreased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was noted during periods with ANC greater than 1,500/mm3 as compared with periods of time with ANC less than 1,500/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two anemic patients had a greater than 20% rise in hematocrit over the study period, and 2 additional patients had a decrease in red blood cell transfusion requirements during G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow myeloid maturation improved in 7 of 9 maintenance phase patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The drug was generally well-tolerated and no severe toxicities were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated that G-CSF administered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by daily subcutaneous administration was well-tolerated and effective in causing persistent improvement of the neutrophil levels and marrow myeloid maturation </plain></SENT>
