<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The erythrocyte transfusional need may be expressed as delta hb = the daily loss of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (mmol/l/day), and multivariate analyses of factors influencing delta hb have been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied 124 patients, mainly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, treated with 537 courses of chemotherapy, inducing cytopenia (a white cell count &lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l) in 476 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfusional need was 2.5-3 times greater than expected, suggesting the presence of haemolysis and/or occult <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multiple regression analysis and repeated measurement analysis the main factor influencing the transfusional need was type/dose of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> the greater then transfusional need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other factors significantly influencing the transfusional need were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, treatment-related events such as positive blood cultures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553576" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic fungal infection</z:e>, mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, melaena/haematemesis and diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was found that the transfusional need decreased gradually during the cytopenic period </plain></SENT>
