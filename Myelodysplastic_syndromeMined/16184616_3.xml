<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 1975, Dixson reported that anti-platelet IgG on platelets from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) is greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people, by determining anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> directly on the platelet surface with a quantitative complement lysis-inhibition-assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG) has been thought of as evidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although platelets from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients show significantly higher PAIgG values than from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individuals, PAIgG is not specific for autoantibody because it increases in other than immune <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed positive platelet percentage with various platelet-associated immunoglobulins: IgG, IgM, IgA, and total immunoglobulins, in the blood from 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and 23 ITP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The specificity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> disease was better in flow cytometry than in ELISA, because, other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was positive in flow cytometry; however, various disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) showed positive in ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry methods had the same sensitivity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> disease as ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it is supposed that there was no nonimmune <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> in this study because the PAIgG negative patients (n = 1) showed positive results in flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flow cytometry method was effective for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> screening, especially for specificity </plain></SENT>
