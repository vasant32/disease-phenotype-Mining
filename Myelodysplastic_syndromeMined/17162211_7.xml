<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after mismatched stem cell transplantation are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our experience with 28 patients (treated with 59 mismatched DLIs; range, 1-7) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was prophylactic in 6 patients (9 DLIs) and therapeutic in 22 (50 DLIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DLI dose ranged from 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(9) T cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 6 patients receiving prophylactic DLI, complete remission was maintained in 5; however, 2 died from GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical response to therapeutic DLI was seen in 6 of 22 (27.3%) patients; a greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden produced a lower response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GVHD appeared in 13 of 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a greater HLA mismatch was associated with a lower risk of GVHD, with 3 of 19 DLIs in 3/6 matching and 16 of 29 DLIs in 5/6 matching with similar follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, no correlation between efficacy and HLA mismatching was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was frequent and usually related to the basic disease rather than to DLI complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mismatched DLI is feasible and may be effective, especially if given soon after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future developments using cell therapy with selective or targeted anticancer activity are warranted, with special attention to prophylactic treatment of T cell depleted mismatched allografts recipients </plain></SENT>
