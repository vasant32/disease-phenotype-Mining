<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the data of 47 patients (31 AL and 16 MDS) who were treated at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients received disease-adapted chemotherapy, with a response rate of 73%, while 14 received no interventions due to an indolent course, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of surviving patients was 1.9 years (range 0.1-10.5) after the diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL, and the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and the 3-year non-relapse mortality was 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients did not undergo HCT due to various reasons including advanced age or comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year OS was better in patients who received HCT than in those who did not (71 vs. 31%; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that HCT was associated with a better OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this study has several limitations, including a potential selection bias due to the retrospective nature of the analysis and a small number of patients, the results show that modern HCT may be useful for inducing long-term survival in a fraction of patients suffering from t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present findings warrant future prospective studies </plain></SENT>
