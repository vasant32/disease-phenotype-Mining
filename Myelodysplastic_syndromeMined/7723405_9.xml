<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study of occupational and environmental risk factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) diagnosed at our institution, using the method of Siemiatycki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A control for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> case, matched for age, sex, and residence area was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire asked demographic data, medical history, and information on life-time environmental and occupational exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occupational exposures were first assessed by job titles, then by evaluating exposure to a list of 70 chemicals, and the level and duration of exposure to those chemicals (exposure index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first 100 cases and controls analyzed, a significantly higher incidence of smokers or ex-smokers was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases (odds ratio, OR = 1.83, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was found in male patients with jobs (or previous jobs) generally exposing to <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi>, including plant and machine operators and assemblers (odds ratio, OR = 3.73, P = 0.014) whereas, on the contrary, technicians and associate professionals were more often seen in controls (OR = 0.17, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In males, there was also a trend for more skilled agricultural workers and coal miners in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In females, there was a non-significant trend for more professionals in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for sex, age and smoking habits, significantly more frequent exposure to stone dusts (OR = 3.06, P = 0.011), and cereal dusts (OR = 2.27, P = 0.04) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend for higher incidence of exposure to exhaust gases and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-organic explosives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, significantly higher exposure indices to petrol and diesel derivatives (P = 0.03) and to fertilizers (P = 0.003) were seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in exposure to other chemicals was seen between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results of our study, which is accruing more cases, suggest, as two previously published case-control studies of risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, that exposure to some chemicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
