<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to this system, FAB low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) were defined as such when the presence of dysplastic features was only restricted to the erythroid lineage, and new categories, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>), were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis of 240 consecutive patients diagnosed at our institution as having FAB RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, we reclassified the disease following the WHO criteria and we found that 179/214 patients (84%) still remained in the RA category, while 35/214 (16%) moved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 17/26 patients (65%) maintained the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> diagnosis, whereas 9/26 (35%) were re-classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected differences among the WHO subgroups as to age and sex distribution as well as to median survival observed by stratifying patients according to different prognostic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we confirmed the usefulness of WHO segregation with regard to its predictive value for evolution into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study provides evidence that WHO classification may have prognostic impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups which are usually categorized by FAB as having a favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
