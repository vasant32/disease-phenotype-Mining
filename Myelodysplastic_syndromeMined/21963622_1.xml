<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no well-accepted rating system for reliably predicting which HLA-mismatched (MM) unrelated donor should be selected for a patient without an HLA allele-matched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ability of an MM ranking system, HistoCheck, to predict the risk associated with HLA class I disparity in a population of 744 single allele or antigen HLA-A, -B, or -C MM myeloablative unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, facilitated through the National Marrow Donor Program between 1988 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were used to adjust for other significant clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA MMs were scored using the HistoCheck Web-based tool, and the patients were divided into 4 quartiles: dissimilarity score (DSS) 1.04-2.84 (allele MM), DSS &gt;2.84-13.75 (allele and antigen MM), DSS &gt;13.75-19.39 (antigen MM), and DSS &gt;19.39-36.62 (antigen MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the lowest scoring quartile as the reference, the DSS groups were evaluated for associations with relapse, treatment-related mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival, and overall survival in the entire cohort and also in subset analyses by disease and disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between DSS and any outcomes in the overall cohort using the quartile categories or treating DSS as a continuous variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher DSS scores were associated with decreased engraftment in early-stage disease (P = .0003), but not in other disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, DSS does not correlate with transplantation outcomes, and the HistoCheck scoring system does not provide an effective technique for ranking HLA class I MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dataset used in this study is available to evaluate new algorithms proposed for donor selection </plain></SENT>
