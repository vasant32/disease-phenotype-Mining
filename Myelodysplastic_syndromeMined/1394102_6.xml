<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the well-described cytogenetic abnormalities associated with particular FAB subtypes in the West were observed, certain important local differences were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ALL, hyperdiploidy was rarely observed, whereas the Philadelphia chromosome was observed in 50% of abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the t(8;21) was infrequently observed in M2 case, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 4 and 6, rarely reported elsewhere, formed 12% of the abnormal cases </plain></SENT>
