<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are using the expressed sequence tag (EST) resource as our primary approach to identifying novel candidate genes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen ESTs were identified from the Human Gene Map at the National Center for Biotechnology Information that had no significant homology to any known genes and were assigned between DNA markers D5S413 and D5S487, flanking the critical region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> at 5q31-q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 17 cDNAs from which the ESTs were derived (65%) were shown to map to the critical region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> by gene dosage analysis and were then sublocalized by PCR screening to a YAC contig encompassing the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 11 cDNA clones, upon full sequencing, had no significant homology to any known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the 8 cDNA clones was shown to be expressed in human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complete coding sequence was obtained for 2 of the novel genes, termed C5orf3 and C5orf4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2.6-kb transcript of C5orf3 encodes a putative 505-amino-acid protein and contains an ATP/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding site motif A (P loop), suggesting that this novel gene encodes an ATP- or a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The novel gene C5orf4 has a transcript of 3.1 kb, encoding a putative 144-amino-acid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We describe the cloning of 2 novel human genes and the sequencing, expression patterns, and mapping to the critical region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> of a further 6 novel cDNA clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genomic localization and expression patterns would suggest that the 8 novel cDNAs described in this report represent potential candidate genes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
