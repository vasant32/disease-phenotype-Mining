<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present an observational protocol, multicentre, open and non-aleatheorised, in patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on transfusional regime with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was meant to prove the effectiveness of the parenteral treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> using continuous devices of subcutaneous profusion and evaluate the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> as well as transfusional requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: There were 28 patients (12 men and 16 women), 12 AR, 15 AS and 1 unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average monitoring lasted 13.5 months and there was a gradual loss of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11 of them had gone during the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months the average of ferritin decreased by 258.51 ng/dl (DE 1208.04; p = 9.4) and after 24 months, it decreased by 979.6 ng/dl (DE 810.31; p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 months the average of requirements increased by 60.57 gHb/month (DE 183.7; p = 0.029) and after 24 months, it increased by 167.3 g/Hb/month (DE 406.5; p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Desferroxiamine treatment is effective at least to prevent an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in these patients, and therefore should be incorporated in the clinical practice </plain></SENT>
