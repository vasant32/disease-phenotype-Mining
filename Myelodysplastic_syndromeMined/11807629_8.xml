<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these serious complications after autologous hematopoietic transplantation ranges from 1.1% to 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior chemotherapy is its most likely cause, but other variables related to these long-term complications are seriously discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that priming of progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood with chemotherapy is also related to a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood after mobilization only with cytokines are related to higher risk is a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we analyze the incidence and variables related to these complications in a series of 99 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> who underwent autologous transplantation using hematopoietic progenitors isolated from peripheral blood mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL in patients alive 5 years after transplant in our series is 8.58%, similar to that reported in other series using bone marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> ( p=0.099), the number of chemotherapy cycles ( p=0.04) received before transplant, and the total dose of mononuclear cells infused at the time of transplant were the only variables associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autologous transplantation with progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood after mobilization with cytokines has probability and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL development similar to bone marrow grafts when compared with other published series </plain></SENT>
