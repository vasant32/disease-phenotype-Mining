<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic utility of peripheral blood neutrophil distribution patterns obtained using the CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE hematology analyzer in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood was obtained from 467 individuals including 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the respective neutrophil distribution patterns were observed using two light scatters [7-degree complexity (7D) and 90-degree lobularity (90D)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These scattering intensities are shown as median (median neutrophil distribution: MND) and coefficient of variation (neutrophil distribution width: NDW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed lower 7D MND, higher 7D NDW, lower 90D MND and higher 90D NDW than other comparable groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas 90D parameters were more diagnostically efficient than 7D ones in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of 90D MND for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients became 78.1 and 78.9%, respectively (cut-off value = 14,514) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>90D NDW was most diagnostically effective with 87.5% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity (cut-off value = 21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both 90D parameters showed no evident correlation with the degree of either <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> or peripheral blood dysgranulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, neutrophil distribution parameters, especially 90D NDW, appear to provide convenient and objective markers for the screening of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in routine laboratory hematology </plain></SENT>
