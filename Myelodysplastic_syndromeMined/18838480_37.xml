<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is based on the morphological criteria proposed by the French-American-British (FAB) and World Health Organization (WHO) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate enumeration of blast cells, although essential for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and for assignment to prognostic groups, is often difficult, due to imprecise criteria for the morphological definition of blasts and promyelocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An International Working Group on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndrome</z:hpo> (IWGM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) of hematopathologists and hematologists expert in the field of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> reviewed the morphological features of bone marrows from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and agreed on a set of recommendations, including recommendations for the definition and enumeration of blast cells and ring sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that (1) agranular or granular blast cells be defined (replacing the previous type I, II and III blasts), (2) dysplastic promyelocytes be distinguished from cytologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promyelocytes and from granular blast cells, (3) sufficient cells be counted to give a precise blast percentage, particularly at thresholds that are important for diagnosis or prognosis and (4) ring sideroblasts be defined as erythroblasts in which there are a minimum of 5 siderotic granules covering at least a third of the nuclear circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clear definitions and a differential count of a sufficient number of cells is likely to improve precision in the diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recommendations should be applied in the context of the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
