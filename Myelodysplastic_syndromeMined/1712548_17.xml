<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> in the treatment of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were entered on study to be treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> by continuous intravenous infusion for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses of the drug ranged from 10 mg/m2/day to 35 mg/m2/day, with most patients receiving 16.5 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the drug was stopped early in the course of treatment because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
