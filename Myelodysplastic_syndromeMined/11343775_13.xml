<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to apply comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in transformation submitted for routine cytogenetic analysis to investigate whether this approach would yield any further information and, if possible, to predict which cases would benefit from CGH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in transformation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CGH revealed nine cases with gains or losses of chromosomal material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six of these cases the chromosomal location of this material was not apparent from cytogenetic analysis especially when multiple markers were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific libraries for the chromosome regions that showed discordance between CGH and conventional cytogenetics, we were able to identify the chromosome location of material within the karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group of six patients, four cases of an unbalanced translocation involving regions of chromosomes 5 and 17 were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these cases had additional abnormalities, including two cases with regions of amplification in which oncogenes are located (MYC, MLL) and one case with a dic(7;21)(p10;p10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases it was possible to characterize complex chromosomal aberrations such as derivative chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and ring chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that CGH can detect true gain and loss of critical chromosome regions more accurately than conventional karyotyping in cases with very complex karyotypes, and can thus prove useful in predicting prognosis and pinpointing areas of the genome that require further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, CGH can be a useful technique to identify the origin of marker chromosomes, and it can assist in choice of probes for confirmatory FISH, when there is no clue provided from the analysis of G-banded chromosomes </plain></SENT>
