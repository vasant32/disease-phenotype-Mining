<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective phase II multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-CEA pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (pRAIT) in rapidly progressing metastatic MTC patients and also how serum biomarker<z:chebi fb="47" ids="50300"> DTs</z:chebi> correlate with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2004 to January 2008, 42 patients were treated with anti-CEA × anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) bispecific antibody (hMN-14 × m734) (40 mg/m(2)), followed by (131)I-di-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> bivalent hapten (1.8 GBq/m(2)) 4-6 d later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The disease control rate (durable stabilization plus objective response) was 76.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity was observed in 54.7% of patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 2, including 1 heavily treated previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After pRAIT, 21 of 37 assessed patients (56.7%) showed a significant impact on DT (≥100% increase of pre-pRAIT calcitonin or CEA DT or prolonged decrease of the biomarker concentration after pRAIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-pRAIT DT and post-pRAIT DT were significant independent predictors for overall survival (OS) from pRAIT (pre-pRAIT: hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.86; P = 0.016; and post-pRAIT: HR, 5.32; 95% CI, 1.63-17.36; P = 0.006) and OS from diagnosis (pre-pRAIT: HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08-0.51; P = 0.001; and post-pRAIT: HR, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.81-20.98; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: pRAIT showed antitumor activity, with manageable hematologic toxicity in progressive MTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased biomarker DT after treatment correlated with increased OS </plain></SENT>
