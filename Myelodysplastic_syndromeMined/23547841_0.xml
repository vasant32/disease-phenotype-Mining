<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) that are down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines possible explanations for that observed down-regulation of miRNA expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since genomic losses are insufficient to explain the down-regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated miRNAs, we explored other avenues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that these miRNAs are predominantly intragenic, and that, in many cases, they and their host genes are expressed in a similar pattern during myeloid maturation, suggesting their co-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This co-regulation is further supported by the down-regulation of several of the host genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the increased methylation of the shared promoters of several miRNAs and their respective host genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies identify a role of hypermethylation of miRNA promoters in the down-regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated miRNAs, unifying research on miRNAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and epigenetic regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into a common pathway </plain></SENT>
