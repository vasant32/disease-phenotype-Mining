<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expansion of undifferentiated lineage negative (lin(neg)) hematopoietic precursors that express NHD13 was markedly inhibited (30-fold) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased expansion was accompanied by decreased production of terminally differentiated cells, indicating impaired differentiation of NHD13 precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rather than differentiate, the majority (80%) of NHD13 lin(neg) precursors underwent apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when induced to differentiate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that NHD13 lin(neg) cells provide a tractable in vitro system for studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
