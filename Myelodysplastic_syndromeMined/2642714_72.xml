<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a phase I/II study, 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and severe transfusion-dependent cytopenia were treated with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) to investigate the effects of rhGM-CSF on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment schedule included dose escalation from 15 micrograms/m2 to 150 micrograms/m2 administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for seven to 14 days and was repeated after a two-week treatment-free interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood leukocyte counts increased dose dependently by 130% to 1,800% in ten patients; a rise of monocytes and eosinophils occurred in seven and six patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No sustained increase in reticulocytes or platelets was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte counts increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients affecting both T-helper and T-suppressor cells; however, the lymphocytes were not activated as analyzed by the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with greater than 14% blast cells in the bone marrow, the percentage of bone marrow blast cells increased during treatment with rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data indicated induction of both proliferation and differentiation of the leukemic clones by rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxic side effects were minor with slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> at the infusion site, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> in the minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, rhGM-CSF effectively stimulates hematopoiesis in vivo in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, as the leukemic cell population can be stimulated in patients with a higher initial blast cell count, the combination of rhGM-CSF with other differentiation-inducing or cytotoxic agents has to be considered </plain></SENT>
