<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) value of the total alpha:beta ratio was 0.82 (0.45) ranging from 0.05 to 1.73 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same ratio in 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was 1.01 (0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the alpha:beta ratios were lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 14 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha-thalassaemia</z:e>-like) (group I), almost within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in 11 (group II), and higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in five (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e>-like) (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each group almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the FAB subtypes were represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of exogenous haem in several of the test samples resulted in a slight to pronounced increase in the alpha:beta ratios, particularly in group I </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was noticed between alpha:beta ratios and various haematological variables or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the alpha:beta ratio varied enormously across the entire population of patients, as well as within each FAB subtype, thereby restricting its prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although haem deficiency may be implicated in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, why this should be remains unclear </plain></SENT>
