<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because qualitative neutrophil and platelet dysfunction is an important concomitant of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, functional studies were performed prospectively of cells from eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> undergoing treatment with recombinant alpha 2 interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil studies performed included myeloperoxidase release and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> generation, measured spectrophotometrically, in response to stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, opsonized zymosan, and the chemotactic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> formyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylalanine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most consistently abnormal of these tests was the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> generation, which was low in six of seven patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean results with this test were significantly lower than controls (mean +/- SD = 5.11 +/- 2.41 nmol/10(6) patient cells vs. 10.14 +/- 3.02 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant change was noted following 2 or 8 weeks of interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, fewer platelet studies were feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient, however, exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet numbers but markedly decreased aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of treatment, this patient's platelet aggregation was noted to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelets from two patients were purified by gel filtration, and the ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratios were determined by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio of one patient was 4.85 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> = 1.85 +/- 0.28) which declined to 3.27 on treatment and then returned to 4.80 following a 14-day period off treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another patient, also with elevated ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, exhibited a smaller decline during a treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these studies it was concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation may be a sensitive marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found for improvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> following alpha 2 interferon treatment. alpha 2 interferon, however, may sometimes have beneficial effects upon platelet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
