<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We prospectively observed a child exposed to intensive multimodality therapy for metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> from emergence of a MLL translocation to disease diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(4;11)(p12;q23) was detected in the marrow 17 months after starting treatment following topoisomerase II poisons, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, local radiation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody with granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and a high cumulative dose of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal genomic breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts joined MLL with FRYL, the Drosophila melanogaster protein homologue of which regulates cell fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> metabolites induced topoisomerase II cleavage complexes that could form both breakpoint junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells harboring the translocation replaced the marrow without clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and differentiation appeared unaffected for 37 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent bilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased blasts in addition to the translocation fulfilled criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MEIS1 target gene of typical MLL fusion oncoproteins was underexpressed before and at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with repair of topoisomerase II cleavage from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> metabolites as the translocation mechanism, whereas other agents in the regimen may have contributed to progression of the clone with the translocation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MLL-FRYL did not increase MEIS1 expression, conferred a proliferative advantage without altering differentiation, and had protracted latency to disease </plain></SENT>
