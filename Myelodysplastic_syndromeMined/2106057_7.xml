<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous trials with alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) have shown some beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of long-term application of IFN-alpha at higher dosages in patients with "low-risk" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were included in the study; eight were treated for a period of 6-36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha was administered at a median dosage of 9, 6, 4 mU/week during the first, second, and third year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response was determined by the status of peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolonged exposure to IFN resulted in a response rate of 3/10 (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an additional case, disease progression was retarded during the third year of therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the withdrawal of IFN, hematological and clinical parameters rapidly deteriorated in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observed improvement of the patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> possibly prolongs their survival and seems to justify further trials on IFN treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
