<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Graft source was related in 47 (56%), unrelated donor (URD) marrow in 11 (13%), and unrelated cord blood (UCB) in 26 (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen included total body irradiation (TBI) in 94% of transplantations; 52 (62%) myeloablative (MA) and 32 (38%) nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-year treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 39% (28%-50%, 95% CI), 23% (12%-32%, 95% CI), 38% (28%-48%, 95% CI), and 48% (38%-58%, 95% CI) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year in patients with pre-HCT complete remission (CR) or &lt;5% blasts was improved at 18% (8%-28%, 95% CI) compared to 35% (16%-54%, 95% CI) in patients with 5%-20% blasts (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, with MA conditioning, the incidence of relapse at 1 year trended lower at 16% (6%-26%, 95% CI) versus 35% (18%-52%, 95% CI) in NMA (P = .06), and a statistically significant decrease in relapse was noted in patients entering HCT with CR or &lt;5% blasts with an incidence of 9% (0%-18%, 95% CI) (MA) versus 31% (11%-51%, 95% CI) (NMA) (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For those patients with &gt; or =5% blasts, MA conditioning did not significantly decrease relapse rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-year TRM was similar between MA and NMA conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients entering transplant in CR or with &lt;5% blasts, prior treatment to reach this level did not impact rates of relapse or transplant-related mortality when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed; however, when broken down by conditioning intensity, there was a trend toward improved DFS in those NMA patients who were pretreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, 1-year DFS was similar using related donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)/marrow, URD marrow, or UCB grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that (1) blast percentage &lt;5% at HSCT is the major predictor of improved DFS and relapse and prior treatment to reach this disease status may have value in leading to improved DFS; (2) MA conditioning is associated with lower relapse risk, particularly in patients with CR or &lt;5% blasts, but is not able to overcome increased disease burden; (3) NMA conditioning yields equivalent TRM, DFS, and OS, and is reasonable in patients unsuited for MA conditioning; (4) the donor sources tested (PBSC, bone marrow [BM], or UCB) yielded similar outcomes </plain></SENT>
