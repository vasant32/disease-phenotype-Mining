<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that therapy of intermediate- and high-grade (excluding Burkitt lymphoblastic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) could be safely dose-intensified with routine filgrastim support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were those who were previously untreated and who had either bulky stage II, or stage III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with working formulation histology D, E, F, G, H, or J; performance status &lt; or = 2; and acceptable end organ function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No upper age limit was specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy was dose-intensified CHOP (CHOP-DI) with filgrastim support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each course was repeated every 14 days for six planned courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight eligible patients were treated with CHOP-DI and had a median follow-up of 5.1 years on this phase II study, designated Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (SWOG) 9349 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival was 51% at 2 years and 41% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 60% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three fatal treatment-related events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with CHOP-DI can be safely administered in the cooperative group setting and results in improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Estimated overall survival at 5 years was 14% better than that of patients treated with standard-dose CHOP in an earlier SWOG study, although progression-free survival of 60% at 2 years-the prespecified end point-was not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CHOP-DI, given every 2 weeks at escalated doses, is a strategy that should be tested in a future randomized clinical trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
