<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(1;7) was detected using a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labeled chromosome 1 centromere-specific DNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This aberration was present in CD34-positive stem cells, the erythroid cell lineage (GPA+), and the granulocytic/monocytic (CD13+ and CD64+) cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were not able to demonstrate the abnormality in the lymphoid cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, the aberration was detected with chromosome 8 centromere-specific DNA probe or by chromosome in situ suppression hybridization (CISS) with a chromosome 8-specific library probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> was detected in stem cells, erythroid precursor cells, megakaryocytes, and granulocytes/monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the chromosome aberrations appear to occur only in cells of myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
