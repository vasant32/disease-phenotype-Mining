<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An international working group of experienced clinicians involved in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reviewed currently used response definitions and developed a uniform set of guidelines for future clinical trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> differ from many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> in their chronicity and the morbidity and mortality caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cytopenias, often without disease progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas response rates may be an important endpoint for phase 2 studies of new agents and may assist regulatory agencies in their evaluation and approval processes, an important goal of clinical trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should be to prolong patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these response criteria reflected 2 sets of goals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: altering the natural history of the disease and alleviating disease-related complications with improved quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that the recommendations presented will require modification as more is learned about the molecular biology and genetics of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Until then, it is hoped these guidelines will serve to improve communication among investigators and to ensure comparability among clinical trials </plain></SENT>
