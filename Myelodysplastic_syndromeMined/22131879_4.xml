<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatic C-CBL mutations were recently described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to determine the role of C-CBL mutations in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to sAML and sought to correlate with clinicohematological features and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples from 51 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (13 with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast 1, and 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast 2) were analyzed for C-CBL mutations at both diagnosis and sAML in the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis was performed for exons 7 to 9 of C-CBL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 51 paired samples, C-CBL mutations were identified in 6 patients at the sAML phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient retained the identical C-CBL mutation (G415S) at sAML evolution and exhibited clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other five patients acquired C-CBL mutations (Y371S, F418S, L370_Y371 ins L, L399V, and C416W) during sAML evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the six patients harboring C-CBL mutations at sAML had additional gene mutations including JAK2(V617F), PTPN11, or N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in clinicohematological features and overall survival with respect to C-CBL mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that C-CBL mutation is very rare (0.6%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but acquisition and/or expansion of C-CBL mutant clones occur in 11.8% of patients during sAML transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that C-CBL mutations play a role at least in part in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients during sAML transformation </plain></SENT>
