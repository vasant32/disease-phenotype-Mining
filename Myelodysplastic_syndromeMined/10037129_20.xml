<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 292 allogeneic transplant recipients measured survival in a subgroup of ABO-incompatible bone marrow graft recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> receiving non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow grafts had an 85-percent greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 100 days of transplant (relative risk, 1.85, 95% CI, 1.33-2.58; p = 0.003) than comparable patients receiving ABO-compatible grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both ABO major- and minor-mismatched graft recipients were at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased mortality rate was not due to an increase in graft failure or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>; rather, patients died of multiple-organ failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, which is consistent with regimen-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was not seen in a larger group of 112 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> patients undergoing similar treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO incompatibility</z:e> may be a significant prognostic risk factor after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in susceptible subgroups of recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Care is necessary to design hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-processing and -transfusion policies to minimize this risk </plain></SENT>
