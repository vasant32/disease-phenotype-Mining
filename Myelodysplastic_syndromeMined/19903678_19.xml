<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> may concur to this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative impact of these factors on the outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> receiving allogeneic stem-cell transplantation remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic effect of transfusion history and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> on the post-transplantation outcome of 357 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> reported to the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) registry between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfusion-dependency was independently associated with reduced overall survival (hazard ratio=1.48, P=0.017) and increased non-relapse mortality (hazard ratio=1.68, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of transfusion-dependency was noted only in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning (overall survival: hazard ratio=1.76, P=0.003; non-relapse mortality: hazard ratio=1.70, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between transfusion burden and overall survival after transplantation (P=0.022); the outcome was significantly worse in subjects receiving more than 20 red cell units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, transfusion-dependency was found to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among transfusion-dependent patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation, pre-transplantation serum ferritin level had a significant effect on overall survival (P=0.01) and non-relapse mortality (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect was maintained after adjusting for transfusion burden and duration, suggesting that the negative effect of transfusion history on outcome might be determined at least in part by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-transplantation transfusion history and serum ferritin have significant prognostic value in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> undergoing myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation, inducing a significant increase of non-relapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that transfusion history should be considered in transplantation decision-making in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
