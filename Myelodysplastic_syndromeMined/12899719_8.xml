<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD)-specific survival (GSS) and the duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment (IST) in 82 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD following allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two major study endpoints were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> solely due to the relapse of underlying disease or accidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were censored at the time of occurrence for the analysis of GSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of GSS at 5 years was 74.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of systemic IST for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 272 d (range: 7-1450), and the probability of withdrawal of systemic IST at 1, 2 and 3 years was 67.3%, 82.4% and 89.0% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis based on a multivariate model showed that a diagnosis other than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (P = 0.049), prior occurrence of grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (P = 0.021), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD before d 120 (P = 0.013), serum alkaline phosphatase over 120 IU/l (P = 0.034), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> over 34.2 micromol/l (P = 0.015) were independent adverse prognostic factors for GSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior occurrence of grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD significantly influenced the duration of systemic IST (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, analyses of GSS and the duration of systemic IST will allow patients with different outcomes to be stratified for appropriate treatment application and will provide important parameters in prospective trials for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
