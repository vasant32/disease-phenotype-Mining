<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>) were treated with 150-300 units/kg rHuEPO for a median time period of 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as an increase of the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level by at least 2 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> were comparable (44.4% and 40% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, respectively), whilst the response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> depended strongly on the disease entity (77.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, 10% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment serum levels of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) were significantly higher in non-responding patients than in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During rHuEPO therapy, EPO levels in non-responders increased even further, while they remained basically unchanged in responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In responders, the WHO performance status before the start of rHuEPO therapy was more favorable and showed impressive improvement during the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of responders was 28.0 months as compared to only 9.2 months for non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> subsided or at least considerably improved under successful rHuEPO therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of occasional flu-like symptoms, no undesirable effects of rHuEPO treatment were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, rHuEPO treatment corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> both in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> and in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, but responsiveness varied considerably amongst the different disease entities </plain></SENT>
