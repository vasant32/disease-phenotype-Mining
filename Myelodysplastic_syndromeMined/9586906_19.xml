<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency of inversion of chromosome 16 (inv[16]) and the type of rearrangement of the CBFB and MYH11 genes in therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and to evaluate a possible relationship to specific types of previous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic studies were performed in 180 consecutive patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in Copenhagen and in 270 consecutive patients in Chicago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells were available for studies of the molecular biology in 72 patients, including four with inv(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An inv(16)(p13q22) was observed in only two of 180 cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in Copenhagen and in only four of 270 cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in Chicago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and inv(16) previously had received combination chemotherapy, which included an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, and in two a DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> was included (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had received paclitaxel followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and one patient had received radiotherapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient, previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, presented a new and, to our knowledge not previously reported, type of fusion transcript, with breakpoint at nt 399 of the CBFB gene and at nt 2134 of the MYH11 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> both presented the less common type D transcript, whereas the most common A transcript, observed in 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) de novo with inv(16), only was observed in the patient treated with paclitaxel and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow or blood cells from 68 patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without an inv(16) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were found to be negative for chimeric rearrangement between the CBFB gene and the MYH11 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study and a review of the literature shows that inv(16) is an uncommon aberration in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and, like balanced translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 and the t(15;17), often is associated with prior chemotherapy with DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints within the MYH11 gene may vary between t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> de novo </plain></SENT>
