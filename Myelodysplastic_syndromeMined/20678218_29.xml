<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gene mutation is an important mechanism of myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the number and combination of gene mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> is still a matter of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched for mutations in the ASXL1, CBL, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, TET2 and WT1 genes in 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) and 64 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>) without balanced translocation or complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations in ASXL1 and CBL were frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TET2 occurred with similar frequency in MDSs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> and associated equally with either ASXL1 or NPM1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations of RUNX1 were mutually exclusive with TET2 and combined with ASXL1 but not with NPM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FLT3 (mutation and internal tandem duplication), IDH1, IDH2, NPM1 and WT1 occurred primarily in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only 14% MDSs but half <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> had at least two mutations in the genes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the observed combinations and exclusions we classified the 12 genes into four classes and propose a highly speculative model that at least a mutation in one of each class is necessary for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with simple or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
