<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study evaluated toxicity, relapse rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival after allogeneic transplantation and conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 52 years (range, 17 to 71 years) and the majority of patients had high-risk disease, comorbidities, and/or modest reduction in performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent of patients had unrelated or mismatched related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 2 to 34 months), 1-year survival was 48% (95% CI, 34% to 61%), progression-free survival was 38% (95% CI, 25% to 52%), relapse rate was 27% (95% CI, 15% to 40%), and treatment-related mortality was 33% (95% CI, 20% to 46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was only 18% (95% CI, 8% to 40%); extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was only observed in recipients of unrelated donor transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performance score and disease status were the major predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk disease (ie, active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with &gt; 5% blasts) or even modest decreases in performance status were associated with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (first or second complete remission) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (&lt; 5% blasts) had excellent outcomes despite unfavorable disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fludarabine and melphalan combined with in vivo alemtuzumab is a promising transplantation regimen for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with active disease, this regimen provides at best modest palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a low incidence of GVHD, transplantation is still associated with considerable nonrelapse mortality in patients with decreased performance status </plain></SENT>
