<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied 28 such cases using the French-American-British Co-operative Group (FAB) classification, which groups them into a separate category termed "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was found to be a heterogenous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Certain patients (4/28) had a previously established <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, but most presented directly as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
