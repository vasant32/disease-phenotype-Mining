<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recombinant (r) human (h) granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (rh GM-CSF) has been shown to increase the number of peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the effect of rh GM-CSF therapy on the in vitro growth of granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colonies (CFU-GEMM), erythroid colonies (BFU-E), and granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 2) to assess in these patients, while they are being treated in vivo with rh GM-CSF, the possible additive effect of rh IL-3 and rh G-CSF on the in vitro growth of haematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The in vitro growth of CFU-GEMM, BFU-E and CFU-GM was studies in 10 myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients, before and after in vivo administration of rh GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After rh GM-CSF administration, the number of CFU-GM increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> standard risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 out of 5 cases, this effect was more pronounced and persisted up to 30 days after the end of rh GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the number of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E was substantially unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When rh GM-CSF, rh G-CSF and rh IL-3 were added in vitro alone or in combination as the source of colony stimulating activity, no significant increase of the CFU-GM colony number was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rh GM-CSF therapy appears useful for increasing the number of peripheral blood granulocytes and of marrow CFU-GM in standard-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are far less responsive to rh GM-CSF treatment, probably reflecting a more aggressive and/or advanced disease </plain></SENT>
