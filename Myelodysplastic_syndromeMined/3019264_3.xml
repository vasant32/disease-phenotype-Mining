<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient, after a prodrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> 60 months after the start of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four months before frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed, bone marrow culture studies showed a marked inability to form colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies demonstrated an abnormal clone of cells that included the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No morphologic abnormalities were noted in the bone marrow of any other long-term survivor; however, the mean corpuscular volume of peripheral red blood cells was greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in three of four patients who remain alive and disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients marrow culture studies also failed to grow colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patients showed a decreased ability to form multilineage colonies and colonies of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in vitro compared with a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed some degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> on cytogenetic analysis; in two cases approximately 50% of cells were aneuploid </plain></SENT>
