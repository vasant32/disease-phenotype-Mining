<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quantity and the quality of mitoses found in BM cultivations of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is rather low and a new possibilities to increase the proliferative activity of the cells are under research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One promising method is the stimulation of the BM cells with addition of hemopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro influence of GM-CSF on the proliferative activity and the representation of chromosomally different clones in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The bone marrow cells of 25 patients (12 males, 13 females) of mean age 52.5 years (range 20-85) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mitotic index (MI), quality of mitoses and chromosomal complement were evaluated in 24 and 72 h cultivations with 100 and 1000 ng/ml GM-CSF concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No stimulation was used in control cultivations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of cultivation 100 ng/ml of GM-CSF increased the mitotic index (112%) but lowered the quality of mitoses (-7.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On contrary after 72 h of presence of 100 ng/ml GM-CSF both parameters showed the decrease (MI-30%, quality of mitoses-36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar effect had the addition of 1000 ng/ml for 24 h of cultivation (MI-5%, quality of mitoses-11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied cells in every type of cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratio of chromosomally abnormal clones was the same in six other cases and only non-significant changes appeared in seven patients after GM-CSF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The influence of GM-CSF on the division of the bone marrow cells is strictly individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF in concentration of 100 ng/ml in 24 h cultivation increases the activity of proliferation, but at the same time moderately decreases the quality of mitoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of GM-CSF has not changed the cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
