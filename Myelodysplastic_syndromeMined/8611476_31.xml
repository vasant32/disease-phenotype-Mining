<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the use of unrelated donors has not been well-characterized, we report on the outcome of 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> consecutively treated between 1987 and 1993 with unrelated donor marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 33 (range 1-53) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>33 patients received chemotherapy and total body irradiation and the remainder <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donors were phenotypically identical at the HLA-A, B and Dw/DRB1 loci in 34 cases and mismatched for one HLA locus in 17 cases and two loci in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow was non-T-cell depleted and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK506 was used for postgrafting immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2-year disease-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality rates were 38%, 28% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient who relapsed survives disease-free after withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>16/19 survivors have a performance status of 90-100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in transformation or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had a significantly higher risk of relapse than patients with less advanced disease (P = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased non-relapse mortality was significantly associated with higher age, longer disease duration before transplant, lower neutrophil count on admission and, unexpectedly, being seronegative for cytomegalovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the outcome with transplantation using unrelated donors is similar to reported results using related donors and that a meaningful proportion of eligible patients with an otherwise incurable disease may be cured with this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, mortality from the transplant procedure is high and future studies should focus on reducing toxicity </plain></SENT>
