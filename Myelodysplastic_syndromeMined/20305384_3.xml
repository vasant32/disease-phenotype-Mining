<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although DNA methyltransferases have been shown to interact with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferases such as EZH2 (which methylates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 on lysine 27) and G9a (which methylates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 on lysine 9), the relationship between DNA methylation and repressive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks has not been fully studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, promoters of genes are often aberrantly methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (a DNA demethylating drug) is used for treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no genome-scale studies of the effects of this drug have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, we report the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on global gene expression and analyze approximately 24,000 human promoters using ChIP-chip to determine how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment effects H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that (1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment results in large changes in gene regulation with distinct functional categories of genes showing increased (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27518,29854,46880">C2H2</z:chebi> zinc finger transcription factors) and decreased (e.g., genes involved in regulation of mitochondria and oxidoreductase activity) levels; (2) most genes that show altered expression are not regulated by promoters that display DNA methylation prior to the treatment; (3) certain gene classes switch their repression mark upon treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (from H3K27me3 to H3K9me3 and vice versa); and (4) most changes in gene expression are not due to relief of repression mediated by DNA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation </plain></SENT>
