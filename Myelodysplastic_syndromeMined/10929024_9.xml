<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the clinical significance of haematopoietic chimaerism as a parameter of patient outcome and detection of relapse for early intervention by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between July 1994 and March 1999, 101 adult patients with malignant disease were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 15 months (range 0.7-56.5) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received busulphan-containing (n = 82) or total body irradiation (TBI)-containing (n = 19) regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen out of 98 (15%) patients with predictive chimaerism analyses relapsed, 5 out of 20 (25%) with mixed chimaerism (MC) and 10 out of 78 (13%) with complete donor chimaerism (CC) before apparent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) as relapse therapy with conversion from MC to CC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with successful DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data stress the importance of chimaerism monitoring after allogeneic transplantation and demonstrate the more frequent occurrence of disease relapse in patients showing MC, rather than CC, after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the assessment of chimaerism has been shown to be a valuable tool in monitoring the efficiency of donor lymphocyte infusions for relapse </plain></SENT>
