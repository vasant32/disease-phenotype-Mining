<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-arm, open-label, multi-center, phase 2 trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) in patients with low or intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt;100 g/L, erythropoietin (EPO) levels &lt;500 IU/L and transfusion requirements &lt;2 units/month over the preceding 2 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was initiated at 300 μg weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients who did not achieve MaR by 8 weeks, filgrastim 300 μg weekly was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01039350 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients (72.7% transfusion independent) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 76.0 years (range 41.3-92.4), 54.5% were male, and 90.9% presented ECOG Status (0-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients received filgrastim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An erythroid response was achieved by 31 of 44 patients (70.5%) at week 8 (47.7% MaR, 22.7% MiR), 31 of 44 patients (70.5%) at week 16 (61.4% MaR, 9.1% MiR), and 32 of 44 patients (72.7%) at week 24 (61.3% MaR, 11.4% MiR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean (95% CI) change in FACT-F at week 24 was 3.61 (0.72 to 6.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline EPO levels &lt;100 IU/L were a predictive factor of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was well tolerated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A fixed dose of 300 μg of darbepoetin alfa weekly (with or without filgrastim) seems to be an effective and safe treatment for anemic patients with low or intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, low transfusion burden and EPO levels &lt;500 IU/L </plain></SENT>
