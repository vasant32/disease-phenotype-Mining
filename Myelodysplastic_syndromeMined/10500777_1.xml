<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The importance of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> can be overcome by several agents including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA), PSC833 and GF120918 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe an investigation into the expression, using MRK16 and UIC2, and function of P-gp using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> with and without modulators by flow cytometric analysis on previously frozen blast cells from 27 patients with primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared this with the in vitro chemosensitivity, using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, of fresh blast cells from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whilst we found a correlation between P-gp function using CsA and GF120918 and expression using MRK16 (p &lt; 0.05) and (p &lt; 0.02) respectively, we were unable to find any overall correlation between expression and function of P-gp with either in vitro sensitivity to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, previous treatment, or 1 degree or 2 degrees disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However it was possible to identify individual patients whose cells exhibited P-gp expression and function teamed with in vitro resistance to, and modification of, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is possible to identify which modulator had the greatest effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fact that we obtained higher indications of resistance reversal using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay along with finding P-gp expression and function in patients sensitive to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, suggests studies of P-gp should be teemed with chemosensitivity testing to identify specific patients who will benefit </plain></SENT>
