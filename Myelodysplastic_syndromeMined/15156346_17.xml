<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responding patients received two consolidation courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, AraC, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, followed by a late consolidation course of intermediate-dose AraC (600 mg/m2 IV every 12 h x 5 days) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi> (60 mg/m2 IV x 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 112 patients (57 male/55 female) with a median age of 58 years (range: 22-75) have been entered and are evaluable for response: 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), 84 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) evolving from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and 9 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after chemotherapy/radiotherapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was higher in patients &lt; or = 60 years (68 vs 55%), mainly due to a lower early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (5 vs 21%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 58 months, the median overall survival is 14.5% and median duration of relapse-free survival 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 60 months, the probability of CR patients to still be in CR and alive is 16% (20% in patients &lt; or = 60 years and 13% in patients &gt;60 years), while the probability of overall survival is 12% (15% in patients &lt; or = 60 years and 9% in patients &gt; 60 years) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, intensive chemotherapy with G-CSF priming is both well tolerated and highly effective for remission induction in these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
