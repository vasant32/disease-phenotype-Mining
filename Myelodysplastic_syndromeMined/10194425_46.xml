<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we randomized 215 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (153 patients) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>] or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, 62 patients) to receive fludarabine + ara-C + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (FAI) alone, FAI + ATRA, FAI + G-CSF, or FAI + ATRA + G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility required one of the following: age over 71 years, a history of abnormal blood counts before M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anderson (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) presentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, failure to respond to one prior course of chemotherapy given outside <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, or abnormal renal or hepatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the two treatment arms containing ATRA, ATRA was given 2 days (day-2) before beginning and continued for 3 days after completion of FAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the two treatment arms including G-CSF, G-CSF began on day-1 and continued until neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts &gt;50,000/microL began ATRA on day 1 and G-CSF on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, failure to achieve complete remission [CR], or relapse from CR) have occurred in 77% of the 215 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reflecting the poor prognosis of the patients entered, the CR rate was only 51%, median event-free survival (EFS) time once in CR was 36 weeks, and median survival time was 28 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A Cox regression analysis indicated that, after accounting for patient prognostic variables, none of the three adjuvant treatment combinations (FAI + ATRA, FAI + G, FAI + ATRA + G) affected survival, EFS, or EFS once in CR compared with FAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were no significant effects of either ATRA ignoring G-CSF, or of G-CSF ignoring ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As previously found, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no indications that the effect of ATRA differed according to cytogenetic group, diagnosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or treatment schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis indicated that, after accounting for prognosis, addition of G-CSF +/- ATRA to FAI improved CR rate versus either FAI or FAI + ATRA, but G-CSF had no effect on the other outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that addition of ATRA +/- G-CSF to FAI had no effect on CR rate, survival, EFS, or EFS in CR in poor prognosis, newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
