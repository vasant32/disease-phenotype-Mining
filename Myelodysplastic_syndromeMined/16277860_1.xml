<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrows</z:e> and 11 patients had normocellular or hypercellular marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose of CsA was 2.5-5.5 mg/(kg.d) for 2 weeks to 2 years (mean 8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two out of 16 patients were treated with CsA alone, 14 patients were treated with CsA, recombinant human erythropoietin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, 1, 25 dihydroxy <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) or two or three of them combination with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment responses were classified according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), hematological improvement (HI) and no response (NR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who obtained CR, PR or HI were defined as responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HI was observed in 12 patients, PR in 2 patients and NR in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total response rate was 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rates shown in neutrophil lineage, platelet and erythroid lineage were 83.3%, 66.7% and 60%, respectively; their shortest time required to obtain some hematologic improvement after initiation of CsA therapy was 2 weeks, 1 month and 1 month, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients being transfusion-dependent before treatment, 3 patients did not need transfusion any more and 5 showed the reduced transfusion requirements after CsA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with RA, 9 responded to CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 1 patient had no response and died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and 5 patients had transient responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the latter transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and two relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The total response rate decreased to 50% in the patients with CsA therapy lasting more than 3 months at the end of following-up </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the usefulness of CsA based therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> with any marrow cellularity is useful, the CsA dose of 3-5 mg/(kg.d) is safe and efficacious </plain></SENT>
