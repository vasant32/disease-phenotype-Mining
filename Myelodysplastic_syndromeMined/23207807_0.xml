<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies focused specifically on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in the elderly, especially regarding the underlying causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in non-institutionalized elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 190 consecutive patients ≥70 years, admitted to a geriatric short-stay unit over a 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was &lt;120 g/L, the following serum assays were performed routinely: iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, TSH, albumin, and haptoglobin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When these tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was performed to look for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> was &lt;120 g/L in 83 (43.7%) of 190 included patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> had a mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 105 ± 11 g/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common potential causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>; each of these causes was found in at least one-third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anemic patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum screen (12/83, 14.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was multifactorial in most patients: the mean number of potential causes per patient was 1.85 ± 1, and 65.4% of the patients had two to four concomitant causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The serum screen used in our study is easy to perform in ambulatory patients and identifies potential causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> for which safe and effective treatments are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Second-line bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> adds to the diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
