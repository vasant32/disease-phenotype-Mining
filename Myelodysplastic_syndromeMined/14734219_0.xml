<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a group of 46 patients with a variety of myelocytic and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with an inversion of chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both pericentric and paracentric inversions occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identified hotspots for breakage were p13 and q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These correspond to gene-rich areas of known chromosome instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inv(12) is difficult to detect and may be misinterpreted as a partial deletion by routine cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies revised the G-banding interpretations of a deleted 12p in some cases to an inversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inv(12) may occur as the sole abnormality in both myelocytic and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, suggesting lineage promiscuity as seen with MLL and ETV6 gene disruptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with the inv(12) had complex karyotypic changes that predicted a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients with known clinical follow-up, many were refractory to chemotherapy and overall survival was short </plain></SENT>
