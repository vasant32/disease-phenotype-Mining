<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic and epigenetic alterations detected by different procedures have been associated to different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types and are considered important indicators for disease classification, differential diagnosis, prognosis, response, and individualization of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The search for new biomarkers has been revolutionized by high-throughput technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this point, it seems that we have overcome technological barriers, but we are still far from sorting the biological puzzle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence based on translational research is required for validating novel genetic and epigenetic markers for routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We herein discuss the importance of genetic abnormalities and their molecular pathways in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss how novel genomic abnormalities may interact and reassess concepts and classifications of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
