<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can produce prolonged clinical remission in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, disease relapse may occur despite BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in animal models and clinical experience have provided evidence that immunologic factors play an important role in preventing relapse post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To stimulate immunologic activity in patients post-BMT, we administered prolonged uninterrupted continuous infusions of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen marrow recipients (seven autologous BMT, six CD6 T-depleted allogeneic BMT) received rIL-2 at a dose of 2 x 10(5) U/m2/d for a scheduled period of 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rIL-2 was administered through a Hickman catheter with a portable pump beginning a median of 85 days after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was minimal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment could be undertaken in the outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient developed any signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ARDS|A.R.D.S.">pulmonary capillary leak syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment did not affect the absolute neutrophil count or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, but eosinophils increased substantially in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts decreased by 20% in 10 of 13 individuals within 2 weeks, but stabilized thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the low dose of rIL-2 administered, significant immunologic changes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients experienced a marked increase (fivefold to 40-fold) in natural killer (NK) cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characterization showed that the majority of NK cells were CD56bright+ CD16+ CD3- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100828'>increase in T-cell number</z:hpo> was noted in only 4 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low-dose rIL-2 treatment resulted in augmentation of in vitro cytotoxicity against K562 and COLO <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This cytotoxic activity could be dramatically enhanced by incubation with additional rIL-2 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The immunologic effects of rIL-2 treatment were similar in both autologous and allogeneic marrow recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that prolonged infusion of rIL-2 at low doses is safe and can selectively increase NK cell number and activity after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further studies to assess the impact these changes may have on disease relapse post-BMT will be undertaken </plain></SENT>
