<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of familial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in a 17-year-old female showing (1) the spontaneous expression of a heritable rare fragile site at 16q22 and (2) a deletion at the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The del(16)(q22), which most likely originated from the fragile site, was the main clonal abnormality detected in the patient's bone marrow cells, whereas a few cells with either del(16)(q22) or fra(16)(q22) were seen in the patient's peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the del(16q) was also detected in the patient's uncultured cells, as demonstrated by FISH, excluding an in vitro origin of the del(16q) during culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow was hypocellular with decreased neutrophils and their precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute neutrophil counts ranged from (0.62 to 1.24) x 10(9)/L with a median value of 1.02 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> than her mother, which correlated with the presence of more cells with del(16q) in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's mother, who was also diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, revealed only a few cells with the rare fra(16)(q22) in her peripheral blood cells, whereas her bone marrow showed cells with both fra(16)(q22) and del(16)(q22), although the del(16q) was present in only 2/20 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some possible candidate genes contributing to the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities involving the 16q22 breakpoint have been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this patient, the del(16)(q22) risk factor is unknown for subsequent development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another point to consider is the need to determine the origin of a chromosome abnormality, particularly when the clinical picture does not fit the chromosome findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although, the observation of a constitutional structural abnormality in a mosaic form is an extremely rare event, it is somewhat different in the case of a fragile site expression, which can, as in this case, be present in some cells and not in others </plain></SENT>
