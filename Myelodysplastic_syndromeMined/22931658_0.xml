<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten MLL-related genes (dupMLL, MLL-ELL, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-AF17, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AF1Q) in 221 MDS cases were detected by multiplex nested RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that 20 patients were detected with positive result among 221 patients and the positive rate was 9.05% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of the positive cases and positive rates of the above mentioned 10 fusion genes were in order: 7 (3.16%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 (0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 2 (0.9%), 1 (0.45%), 1 (10.45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the multiplex nested RT-PCR has been confirmed to be able to detect 10 fusion genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which can provide important evidences for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and give related necessary information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and its prognosis </plain></SENT>
