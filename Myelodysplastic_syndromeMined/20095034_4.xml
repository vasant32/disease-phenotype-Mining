<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCV-infected patients are also prone to developing peripheral cytopenias, the etiologies of which are multifactorial and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> and/or antiviral medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of these patients may undergo bone marrow biopsy but no study has systematically recorded the bone marrow findings in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the range of bone marrow findings in 47 adult HCV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients, who lacked concurrent human immunodefiency virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, most commonly presented for a bone marrow biopsy due to abnormal peripheral cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow biopsies displayed a range of findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dyserythropoiesis, present in 19% of the cases, was the most common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>(n = 6), as defined by current World Health Organization standards, were the most likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow abnormalities</z:e>; two pancytopenic patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, and one patient had a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation in bone marrow findings and antiviral medications, MELD score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, suggesting that the degree of bone marrow dysfunction is independent of stage of HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that bone marrow biopsy in HCV-infected patients, even those with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> and/or documented antiviral therapy, can be a valid test for hematologic evaluation, especially for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and/or sudden alterations in peripheral cell counts </plain></SENT>
