<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data of our group and others provide evidence that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> may regularly occur at the level of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells can be discriminated by function and specific surface molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD34, a glycophosphoprotein, is a cellular surface antigen characteristically expressed by stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ stem cells can be further subdivided by the expression of additional surface molecules like CD38 and CD117 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article we present results from cytogenetic examinations of FACS-isolated stem cell subpopulations in eight patients (four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of them displayed clonal karyotype abnormalities at the time of first diagnoses in the native bone marrow (5q-; 5q- and complex abnormalities; +8; inv(16) and +8; i(17q) and -21; i(21q)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used CD117, the receptor for the stem cell factor (also KIT oncogene) as a new cellular surface marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34+/CD117+/- stem cell subpopulations were examined in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found leukemic stem cells in every type of stem cell subpopulation examined (CD34+/CD38-, CD34+/CD38+, CD34+/CD117-, CD34+/CD117+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary, progression-associated chromosome abnormalities likewise were demonstrable in CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In three patients a mosaic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal metaphases was found in the highly purified stem cell subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stem cells are the target of leukemogenic genetic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CD117 as a new marker to isolate different CD34+ subpopulations was not sufficient to discriminate between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings have implications for autologous stem cell transplantation, high-dose chemotherapy and the pathogenetic concept of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
