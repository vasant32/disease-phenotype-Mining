<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least eight conflicting guidelines or consensus statements on iron management in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been published by medical organizations during the past 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncertainties about the clinical importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and the necessity for iron chelation in transfusion-requiring patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> for patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I also draw parallels between iron and <z:chebi fb="72" ids="33314">radon</z:chebi> with respect to the possibility of biological harm, lack of definitive study results, existence of groups at special risk, and fear that the ongoing uncertainties about these elements incite in patients </plain></SENT>
