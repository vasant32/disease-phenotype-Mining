<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a preliminary study involving 10 dogs to assess the applicability of body MRI for staging of canine diffuse hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted (before and after intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>), T2-weighted, in-phase, out-of-phase, and short tau inversion recovery pulse sequences were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using digital region of interest (ROI) and visual comparison techniques, relative parenchymal organ (medial iliac lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney cortex, and kidney medulla) signal intensity was quantified as less than, equal to, or greater than that of skeletal muscle in 2 clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> young adult dogs and 10 dogs affected with either B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 7) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Falciform fat and urinary bladder were evaluated to provide additional perspective regarding signal intensity from the pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs with nonfocal disease could be distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs according to both the visual and ROI signal-intensity relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs, liver signal intensity on the T2-weighted sequence was greater than that of skeletal muscle by using either the visual or ROI approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However in affected dogs, T2-weighted liver signal intensity was less than that of skeletal muscle by using either the ROI approach (10 of 10 dogs) or the visual approach (9 of 10 dogs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the comparison of relative signal intensity among organs may have merit as a research model for infiltrative parenchymal disease (ROI approach) or metabolic effects of disease; this comparison may have practical clinical applicability (visual comparison approach) as well </plain></SENT>
