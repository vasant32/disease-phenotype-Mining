<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received a 10-day continuous intravenous infusion of this compound, which is complementary to p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No major toxicity attributable to a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/hr was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A range of approximately 9 to 18% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as intact oligonucleotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of malignant cells recovered from bone marrow and peripheral blood at intervals before, during, and after treatment reveals no enhanced growth potential following oligonucleotide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can be administered at this dose level to humans without major toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher doses need to be evaluated for toxicity and potential clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
