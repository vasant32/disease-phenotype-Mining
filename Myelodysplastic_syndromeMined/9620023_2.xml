<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of the hematologic effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have emphasized the morphologic changes induced by these growth factors, but few have reported increases in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report six cases in which growth factor treatment resulted in a marked but temporary increase in peripheral and bone marrow blasts that led to diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients were receiving treatment for hematologic malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and one patient had an optic nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100620'>germinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth factor treatment included single agent therapy with G-CSF (three patients), GM-CSF (one patient), or simultaneous therapy with G-CSF and GM-CSF (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, there was a dramatic increase in blasts in the peripheral blood (39% and 20%), whereas four had substantial increases in blasts on the aspirate smear (8%-41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had a medium-sized blast cluster shown on the core biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blasts decreased after removal of growth factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that growth factor therapy can cause a substantial transient increase in blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood that may be confused with relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or progression of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
