<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicenter phase II study of cloretazine was conducted in patients 60 years of age or older with previously untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cloretazine 600 mg/m2 was administered as a single intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by age, performance score, cytogenetic risk category, type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred four patients, median age 72 years (range, 60 to 84 years), were treated on study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Performance status was 2 in 31 patients (30%) and no patient had a favorable karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (45%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, 25 patients (24%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e>, and 19 patients (18%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, defined as per the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 32%, with 29 patients (28%) achieving complete response (CR) and four patients (4%) achieving CR with incomplete platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rates in 44 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, 45 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, and 15 high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were 50%, 11%, and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response by cytogenetic risk category was 39% in 56 patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk and 24% in 46 patients with unfavorable cytogenetic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (18%) patients died within 30 days of receiving cloretazine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 94 days, with a 1-year survival of 14%; the median duration of survival was 147 days, with a 1-year survival of 28% for those who achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cloretazine has significant activity and modest extramedullary toxicity in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Response rates remain consistent despite increasing age and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
