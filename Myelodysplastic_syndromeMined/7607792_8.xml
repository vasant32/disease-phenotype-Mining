<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to determine the prevalence and histologic appearance of cutaneous lesions in patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The histologic changes of cutaneous lesions in 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, and myeloid, myelomonocytic, or monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are presented in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two types of cellular infiltrates were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first group, the most common pattern was a diffuse involvement by the leukemic cells through the entire dermis with preservation of a "grenz zone" in the superficial dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases exhibited a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-like pattern, with prominent slit-like blood-filled spaces lined by myeloblasts against a fibrocellular stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second group of lesions was characterized by dense, neutrophilic dermal infiltrates resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000999'>pyoderma</z:hpo> gangrenosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of these cases, scattered immature blast cells admixed with the mature neutrophilic elements were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of these different morphologic features and application of special stains are of value in the evaluation of suspicious cutaneous infiltrates in patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
