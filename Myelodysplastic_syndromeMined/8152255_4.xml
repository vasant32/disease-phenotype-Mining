<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomies</z:mp> were detected by interphase FISH with repeat-sequence probes (RSP) or by using metaphase FISH with whole-chromosome paint probes (WCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific translocations were detected using WCP probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations were observed using metaphase FISH in two patients in uncertain or complete remission (CR), who both later suffered relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients with no abnormal cells remained in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> detected during CR suffered relapse; metaphase FISH detected the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in 0.17-16% of metaphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients for whom the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> occurred in 0.034% of cells remained in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trisomic nuclei were observed in 0.27-2.3% of interphase cells, by means of RSPs, in four patients who later suffered relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients with trisomic nuclei in 0.061% remained in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When two probes were used simultaneously in a sample from one patient, 1% of the residual cells were abnormal </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient with anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CD30-positive interphase cells were shown to have trisomic chromosome 7 by immunophenotyping and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that metaphase FISH using WCP probes is a sensitive and specific method for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> especially in patients with translocations </plain></SENT>
