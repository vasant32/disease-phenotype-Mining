<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to link hematopoiesis-relevant miRNAs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed 25 mature miRNAs in total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of 25 newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve miRNAs in BM and six in PB were differentially expressed between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of these miRNAs, belonging to the cluster 17-92, were overexpressed in both BM and PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>miR-15a in BM ( p = 0.034) and miR-16 in PB ( p = 0.005) were differentially expressed between low-risk and high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>miR-222 ( p = 0.0023) and miR-181a ( p = 0.014) expression was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in both BM and PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study adds further evidence to the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and their transformation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
