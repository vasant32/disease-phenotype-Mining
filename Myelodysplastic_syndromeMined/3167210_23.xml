<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was still present in eight patients when t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-ANLL developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 16 patients with chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow cells had loss or rearrangement of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a t(15;17), and one had inadequate material for cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphase cells (3% to 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for HDAC therapy were progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in 13 patients or rising blast count in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients died of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> following therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four others had refractory t-ANLL and died within the subsequent 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one of ten patients with a poor performance status (PS greater than or equal to 2 using the ECOG scale) achieved a complete remission, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients with a good performance status (PS less than or equal to 1) had a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematologic remissions were achieved in 8 patients (47%) after one (6 patients) or two (2 patients) induction courses and were confirmed by recovery of a 100% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow karyotype in six of the seven patients who were retested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in remission received one to four consolidation courses with HDAC alternating with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, but seven relapsed within 8 months (median remission duration, 5 months) </plain></SENT>
