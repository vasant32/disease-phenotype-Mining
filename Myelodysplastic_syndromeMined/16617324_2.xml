<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disorders</z:e>, 6p abnormalities, isolated in six patients, were highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with different breakpoints along the 6p arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal translocations were found in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 10 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>), the short arm of chromosome 6 was involved in unbalanced translocations in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other three patients showed full or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the 6p arm, that is, i(6)(p10) (one patient) and dup(6)(p) (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5/7 patients with unbalanced translocations, DNA sequences were overrepresented at band 6p21 as either cryptic duplications (three patients) or cryptic low-copy gains (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the eight patients with cytogenetic or cryptic 6p gains, we identified a common overrepresented region extending for 5-6 megabases from the TNF gene to the ETV-7 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6p abnormalities were isolated karyotype changes in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we hypothesize that 6p gains are major pathogenetic events arising from acquired and/or congenital genomic instability </plain></SENT>
