<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a 50-year-old male patient who had originally presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in October 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) FAB subtype <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t was established in April 1993 by histological bone marrow (BM) examination, and therapy with low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a phase of partial hematological remission, cytogenetic assessment in August 1993 revealed a ring chromosome 1 in 13 of 21 metaphases beside BM cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes [46,XY,r(1)(p35q31)/46,XY] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One month later, the patient progressed to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), subtype M4 with 40% BM blasts and cytogenetic examination showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> by the appearance of additional numerical aberrations in addition to the ring chromosome [46,XY,r(1),+8,-21/45,XY,r(1),+8,-21,-22/46, XY] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy was applied to induce remission in preparation for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from the patient's HLA-compatible son </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After BMT, complete remission was clinically, hematologically and cytogenetically (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male karyotype) confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete hematopoietic chimerism was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relapse in January 1997 was successfully treated using donor lymphocyte infusion and donor peripheral blood stem cells (PB-SC) in combination with GM-CSF as immunostimulating agent in April 1997, and the patient's clinical condition remained stable as of January 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is an interesting case of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the ring chromosome 1 we also describe a rare cytogenetic abnormality that predicted the poor prognosis of the patient, but the patient could be cured by adoptive immunotherapy and the application of donor's PB-SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case confirms the value of cytogenetic analysis in characterizing the malignant clone in hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, the importance of controlling the quality of an induced remission and of the detection of a progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
