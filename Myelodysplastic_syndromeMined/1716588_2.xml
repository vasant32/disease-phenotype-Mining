<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the pharmacokinetics of an i.v. bolus of recombinant human EPO in ten subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal serum EPO concentration varied from 210 to 5984 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma half-time clearance (t1/2) varied from 3.9 to 20.0 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between t1/2 and basal EPO concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in immature peripheral blood reticulocytes was found on days 1 and 2 after EPO treatment; this may represent either an effect on hemopoiesis or on reticulocyte release from the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
