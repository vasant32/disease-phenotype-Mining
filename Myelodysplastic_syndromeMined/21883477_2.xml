<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transplant outcomes from 46 consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed according to the conditioning intensity: reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC; n = 14), intensified RIC by adding low-dose total body irradiation (iRIC; n = 15), and myeloablative conditioning (MAC; n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 73.7 months, RIC had a better 4-yr overall survival (OS) (92.9%) compared with the iRIC (64.2%) or MAC (70.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that RIC was associated with improved OS compared with the MAC [relative risk (RR) of 0.08, P = 0.022] because of a lower transplant-related mortality (TRM) (RR, 0.08, P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>iRIC failed to show survival benefits over the MAC (RR of 0.77, P = 0.689) because of similarly high TRM (RR of 0.41, P = 0.480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) after RIC was higher, but GVHD-specific survival was significantly better (RIC 100% vs. iRIC 45.7% vs. MAC, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse rate was not different among the three groups, but in the RIC group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was available and useful for inducing remission in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that RIC improved OS by directly lowering TRM and indirectly giving an additional chance for relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the era of hypomethylating treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIC-SCT should be considered for relative healthy lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
