<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significantly reduced NK activity was detected in the patients' PB compared with the activity in the healthy controls (p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar difference in NK cell activity between the 2 groups was also observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant differences in cells positive for the NK cell markers Leu-7 and Leu-11b were found between patients and controls, either in PB or in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' PB and bone marrow mononuclear cells had, however, a reduced percentage and absolute number of Leu 3a+ and T8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with smouldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> have immunological derangements which may make them predisposed for the later development of florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
