<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 63-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> at the stage of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), first diagnosed in December 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a period of stability, with no need for transfusions, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in August 1998 with the emergence of a cytogenetic abnormality (11q-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two courses of chemotherapy were given, resulting in prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>; however, no clearance of bone marrow (BM) blasts was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At that time, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequent transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (2-3/week) were necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 months of persisting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, we started a therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>: 4 x 250 mg intravenously (i.v.) weekly for 1 month, followed by a maintenance therapy with 500 mg once weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> therapy, hematopoiesis began to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent 2 months, the patient became completely independent of the platelet transfusions; the transfusion frequency of RBC was permanently reduced (2 RBC transfusions/month) and a significant decrease of BM blasts was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 30 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> therapy, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> switched to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>)-like appearance, with continuously increasing leukocytes, so that we discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> therapy for 1 month to exclude a possible side effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At that time, leukocytes further increased to 74,000/microl; thus, we decided to perform a cytoreductive chemotherapy (hydroxycarbamide) and continued weekly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During 1 year of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> therapy, the patient had a good quality of life, with no need for hospitalization and a complete cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in this case, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> had two effects: a significant improvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>impaired hematopoiesis</z:mp> and a slowing down of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> might be a therapeutic option in older patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
