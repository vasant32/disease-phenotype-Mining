<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were distributed in 5 FAB subgroups: RA 21, SA 7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t 9 and MMCL 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukaemic transformation occurred in 3 RA, 3 RAEB, 7 RAEB-t and 3 MMCL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No SA patient suffered from leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic alterations occurred in 13 of 29 examined patients; 5q- was the most common abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find any relation between chromosomal anomalies and FAB subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leukaemic transformation, however, was more frequent in patients with cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases it was not easy to determine the precise diagnostic allocation according to FAB subgroups; it is possible, however, to subdivide <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prognosis into 2 classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The more satisfactory therapy of leukaemic transformation is often due to low doses of Ara-C; this therapy allowed a better survival and sometimes to obtain CR which in a M6 ANLL patient continued for 24 months </plain></SENT>
