<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence and prognostic value of TET2 point mutations and other genomic alterations by direct sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis in 111 de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations were observed in 19 (17%) of the 111 patients compared with 10 (27%) of 36 patients who had failed to achieve CR (P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 111 patients who had achieved CR, TET2 alterations were only significantly associated with NPM1 mutations but not with other pretreatment characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TET2 gene status was not significantly correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival, both in the entire cohort and in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
