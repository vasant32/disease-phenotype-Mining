<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment of remission and treatment decisions are based on cytological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the prognostic impact of cytogenetic remission status in 118 patients with abnormal karyotype who received induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial cytogenetics were: 28 good-risk (14x t(15;17), 9x t(8;21), 5x inv(16)), 44 intermediate-risk, and 46 high-risk karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 20 achieved partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the patients who reached cytological CR retained an abnormal karyotype after induction, 13 of whom had been classified as standard-risk and therefore did not receive intensified consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients achieved cytogenetic CR (CCR), including 24 out of 28 (86%) patients with low-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CCR rate was lower in patients with intermediate-risk (48%) or poor-risk cytogenetics (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival (excluding patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M3) of the CCR group was 37 months, as compared to 11 months in patients with persistence of abnormal karyotype (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference remained statistically significant when calculated only for patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis after induction chemotherapy provides meaningful information especially in patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with a persisting abnormal karyotype must be regarded as high-risk patients who should receive intensified treatment </plain></SENT>
