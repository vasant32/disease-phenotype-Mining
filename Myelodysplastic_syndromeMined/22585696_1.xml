<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> age 15 to 65 years with appropriate organ function and no core-binding factor abnormality were candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy was vorinostat 500 mg orally three times a day (days 1 to 3), idarubin 12 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) daily Ã— 3 (days 4 to 6), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 1.5 g/m(2) IV as a continuous infusion daily for 3 or 4 days (days 4 to 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in remission could be treated with five cycles of consolidation therapy and up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with single-agent vorinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to stop early if either excess toxicity or low probability of median event-free survival (EFS) of more than 28 weeks was likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a three-patient run-in phase, 75 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 52 years (range, 19 to 65 years), 29 patients (39%) were cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and 11 (15%) had FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No excess vorinostat-related toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction mortality was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EFS was 47 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks), and overall survival was 82 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate (ORR) was 85%, including 76% complete response (CR) and 9% in CR with incomplete platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ORR was 93% in diploid patients and 100% in FLT-3 ITD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Levels of NRF2 and CYBB were associated with longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of vorinostat with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is safe and active in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
