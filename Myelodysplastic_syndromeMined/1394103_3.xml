<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, there was complete agreement between metaphase and interphase findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interphase analysis alone provided important cytogenetic information on the first specimens received following intensive combination chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation where metaphase analyses were uninformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of a minor post-treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 population by interphase but not metaphase studies may have identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> prior to recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this longitudinal study, it is concluded that metaphase and interphase cytogenetic analyses form complementary approaches and that use of both provides greater analytical power when appropriate chromosome markers are available </plain></SENT>
