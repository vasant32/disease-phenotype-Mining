<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and clonal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of clonal cells identified by FISH among apoptotic cells was lower than the proportion among nonclonal cells in 17 of 18 patients, regardless of whether ISEL or AV/ FLOW was used to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique allows us to identify simultaneously clonality (as determined by FISH) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in individual cells and shows that although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurs predominantly in residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (FISH-negative) cells, a proportion of clonal precursors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow also die from programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism may be responsible for the generally slow expansion of the clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
