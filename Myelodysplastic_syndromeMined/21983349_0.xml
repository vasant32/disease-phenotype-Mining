<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to examine the presence of -308A/G TNFα variants and to analyze whether it is associated with clinical parameters in a cohort of 101 Argentinean de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The A/A+A/G genotype at TNFα -308 was overrepresented 2-fold in our population (p=0.0499, odds ratio-OR: 2.107) and these differences were more evident in RA-FAB subtype (p=0.0424, OR: 2.502) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the high expressing -308A allele was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (8.3 vs 9.9g/dL; p=0.0206), <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>reduced platelet counts</z:mp> (89,000 vs 130,000/μL; p=0.0381) and younger age (59 vs 68years; p=0.0122) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, these patients showed 3.8-fold higher risk of transfusion requirement (76% vs 46%, p=0.0105) during the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of an inherited -308A TNFα, which increases its transcription level, was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phenotype in our cohort of Argentine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, an overexpression of TNFα may promote an underlying proinflammatory state that cooperates with intrinsic defects within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors to increase the severity of certain phenotypic features of the disease </plain></SENT>
