<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD15 MAbs stained mature myeloid cells predominantly located close to the bone marrow trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-gpIIIa MAbs permitted precise identification of megakaryocytic cells including precursors and dysplastic megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Labelling with CD45 and CD68 MAbs, recognizing lymphocytes and macrophages respectively, was intense in patients in steady state, but progressively decreased during leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increase in CD45+ and/or CD68+ cells was also observed in most bone marrow biopsies after 3 months of r gamma-interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
