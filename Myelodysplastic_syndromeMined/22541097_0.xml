<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of p57kip2 and CXCR4 in 67 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was measured by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD34(+) cells in the bone marrow from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>18 healthy volunteers were recruited for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of SDF-1 on p57kip2 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was investigated in vitro, and difference between them was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> displayed a significant reduction of p57kip2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in BMMNC compared with that in control group (P &lt; 0.001) and there was a negative correlation between p57kip2 expression and percentage of CD34(+) (r = -0.458, P &lt; 0.001); the patients with abnormal karyotype showed lower expression of p57kip2 gene, compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of CXCR4 had no difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, a positive correlation between p57kip2 and CXCR4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was still found (r = 0.609, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SDF-1 increased p57kip2 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMMNC in dose-dependent manner, but BMMNC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed no response to SDF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SDF-1-induced p57 expression was blocked by AMD3100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the low expression of p57 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SDF-1-induced p57kip2 expression in BMMNC, and the decreasing response of BMMNC to SDF-1 may contribute to the low expression of p57kip2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
