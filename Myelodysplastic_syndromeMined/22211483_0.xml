<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on 31 consecutive lower-risk non-del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> refractory to ESA and treated with LEN in a compassionate programme, 20 of whom also received an ESA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An erythroid response was obtained in 15 patients (48%), including 10 of the 27 (37%) previously transfusion-dependent (RBC-TD) patients, who became transfusion-independent (RBC-TI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of the responders relapsed, whereas 6 (40%) were still responding and transfusion-free after 11(+)-31(+) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median response duration was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The erythroid response rate was lower in refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (27% vs. 60%) and tended to be higher in patients treated with LEN + ESA (55% vs. 36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response duration was significantly longer in responders who obtained RBC-TI and in patients treated with LEN after primary resistance to ESA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main toxicity of LEN was cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirm that, in a patient population of lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without del 5q clearly resistant to ESA, LEN is an interesting second line therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its combination with ESAs in this context warrants prospective studies </plain></SENT>
