<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The elimination half-life of rhG-CSF varied with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The half-life of an initial dose of rhG-CSF (2 micrograms/weight kg) was significantly prolonged in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (2.7 +/- 0.3 h, n = 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (2.0 +/- 0.3 h, n = 3) when compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.9 +/- 0.5 h, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> which was overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation, the half-life was shortened after chemotherapy (0.2 +/- 0.1 h, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The half-life of rhG-CSF in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in complete remission was prolonged (2.0 and 2.7 h) at the time of marrow-suppression after chemotherapy and then shortened (0.5, 1.0 h, respectively) in the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The half-life of rhG-CSF was very weakly, inversely correlated with absolute neutrophil count in blood (n = 24, r2 = 0.32, P &lt; 0.01), and was inversely correlated with the absolute count of bone-marrow myeloid cells (nucleated cell count in bone-marrow aspirates x the percentage of myeloid cells/100) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (n = 12, r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the half-life of intravenously administered rhG-CSF (2 micrograms/kg) reflects the size of the myeloid cell compartment in vivo, and support the hypothesis that receptor-mediated consumption mainly accounts for the clearance of exogenous G-CSF </plain></SENT>
