<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in the absence of increased myeloblasts or cytogenetic abnormalities is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of ring sideroblasts (RS) in this setting is often used to support the diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed 843 patients initially classified as therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in our hospital over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (2.3%) patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, &lt;5% bone marrow (BM) blasts, and ��15% RS (17-70%), forming this study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reviewing clinical charts and follow-up BM specimens, we confirmed the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 13 patients, but in 6 patients the blood counts returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and RS and associated dyserythropoiesis disappeared in the follow-up BM biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 21 months, none of these 6 patients died of BM causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, the 6 patients with transient/reversible RS showed comparable numbers of RS and BM blasts, but infrequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> involving non-erythroid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the presence of ≥15% RS in the post-therapy setting is not necessarily indicative of a clonal stem cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients with transient/reversible RS received α-interferon therapy which may contribute to RS formation in this setting </plain></SENT>
