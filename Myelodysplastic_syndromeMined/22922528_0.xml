<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional signaling-dependent or signaling-independent pathways lead to metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of GPVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: Analysis of platelet GPVI expression and signaling in a patient with a collagen-selective defect associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) uniquely demonstrates divergent pathways leading to ROS generation and Syk phosphorylation in human platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surface expression of GPVI and ligand-induced ROS generation was quantitated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GPVI shedding and Syk phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite platelet count/size and GPVI surface expression within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, platelet-rich plasma showed no aggregation in response to collagen or GPVI-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> collagen-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, but aggregated in response to other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, consistent with dysfunctional GPVI signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed rapid GPVI-dependent Syk-independent ROS generation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-dependent GPVI homodimerization, but not Syk-dependent ROS or ligand-induced shedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Temporal analysis showed a gradual decline in platelet count and the appearance of ligand-induced phosphorylation of an ∼40-kDa Syk fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that GPVI ligation in platelets induces intracellular ROS production independent of either Syk activation or divergent pathways leading to platelet aggregation or ectodomain shedding </plain></SENT>
