<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the survival rate, prognostic factors, incidences of late sequelae, and immune reconstitution in 22 infants who underwent allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival estimate was 45.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 24.4% to 63.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients died of transplant-related complications and six died of disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission status at the time of BMT was the most important prognostic factor (P = 0.005): no patient who received a transplant while their disease was not in remission survived, whereas the 5-year survival estimate for infants who underwent BMT during remission was 56% (95% CI, 31% to 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes in the 10 infant survivors were compared with those of 10 older controls matched for diagnosis, disease status at the time of BMT, calendar year at the time of BMT, and source of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune function 1 year after transplantation and the incidences and spectra of late sequelae were similar for both groups during a median of 3.5 years (range, 1.5 to 7.2 years) of follow-up </plain></SENT>
