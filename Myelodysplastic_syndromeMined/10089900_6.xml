<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells were enriched to a purity of 87% +/- 2% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and assayed in short-term suspension cultures in the presence of 10 ng/mL of PEGylated recombinant human megakaryocyte (MK) growth and development factor (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF) and in addition to 50 ng/mL stem cell factor and 10 ng/mL interleukin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells of the megakaryocytic lineage were identified by flow cytometric analysis of CD42b (GP1b) and mature MKs by morphologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcription of c-mpl receptor-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the CD34+ cells of these patients was investigated by full-length reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the p form of c-mpl as well as of the alternative splice product c-mpl k </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cells from seven healthy bone marrow donors served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentiation along the MK pathway was stimulated in five patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-mpl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in the CD34+ cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three low-risk patients the capacity for in vitro MK growth was absent or minimal even though <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for c-mpl receptor was detected in the CD34+ cells of this group as well </plain></SENT>
