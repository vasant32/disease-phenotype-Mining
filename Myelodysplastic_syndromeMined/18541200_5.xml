<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 291 consecutive patients, 178 (61%) had absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) &lt;1500/microL and 113 (39%) had ANCs &gt; or =1500/microL within 2 weeks before HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutropenic patients more often had poor-risk karyotypes (34% versus 12%, P &lt; .0001) and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System scores (37% versus 18%, P = .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After HSCT, the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>Gram-positive</z:mp> bacteria and invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> was significantly increased among neutropenic patients (rate ratio [RR] 1.77, P = .02 and RR = 2.56, P = .03, respectively), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> bacteria were not affected (RR 1.33, P = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hazards of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.62 [1.1-2.4], P = .01), overall mortality (HR = 1.55 [1.1-2.1], P = 0.007), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality (HR = 2.22 [1.2-4.2], P = .01) were increased in neutropenic patients, whereas relapse, engraftment, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> were not affected </plain></SENT>
