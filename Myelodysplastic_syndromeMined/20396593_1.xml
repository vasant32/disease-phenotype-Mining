<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic and epigenetic pathways that determine disease stage and progression are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we used gene expression microarray methodology to examine the gene expression differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at different disease stages, using both unselected and CD34+ selected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hematopoietic cells were observed for several genes and pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several genes promoting or opposing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were dysregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, most notably MCL1 and EPOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression from RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>(T) was associated with increased expression of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the RAR-RXR pathway, critical for maintaining a balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, was found to be deregulated in hematopoietic cells from patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insights into the understanding of the pathophysiology and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and may guide to new targets for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together with previous published data, the present results also underscore the considerable complexity of the regulation of gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
