<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present analysis involving 7950 patients showed an HLA-DR15 frequency of 31% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, compared with only 23% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR15 was more prevalent in Caucasian patients than in non-Caucasian patients (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients in the non-Caucasian subgroups were too small to allow further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among Caucasian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, the presence of HLA-DR15 did not significantly affect the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant correlation between DR15 and TNF polymorphisms at position -308 among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the TNF-308 AG genotype conferred an increased risk of NRM compared with the GG genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; P = .02), even after adjusting for DR15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the TNF-863 AA genotype was correlated with decreased overall mortality and NRM compared with the CC genotype (HR, 0.36, P = .04 vs HR, 0.13, P = .04), even after adjusting for DR15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between TNF-308 or -863 polymorphisms and transplantation outcome in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TNF polymorphisms, but not DR15, affect transplantation outcome in a disease-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
