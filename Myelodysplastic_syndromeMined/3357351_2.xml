<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, Adipo-CFC in IDA was higher than that in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment, Adipo-CFC decreased in IDA, but it increased in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> only at the responsive stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, it is suggested that increase of Adipo-CFC occurs during not only regenerating hemopoiesis but also accelerated erythropoiesis such as severe IDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colony-stimulating activity (CSA) production by marrow stromal cells (MSC) in AA was lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low Adipo-CFC and defective CSA production by MSC may explain in part the pathogenesis of microenvironmental defect in AA </plain></SENT>
