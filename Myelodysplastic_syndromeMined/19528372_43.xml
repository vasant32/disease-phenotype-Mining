<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of an alternative dosing regimen administered on an outpatient basis in academic and community-based practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> 20 mg/m(2) by IV infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were &gt; or = 18 years of age and had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (de novo or secondary) of any French-American-British (FAB) subtype and an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score &gt; or = 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR) by International Working Group (IWG 2006) criteria; secondary end points included cytogenetic responses, hematologic improvement (HI), response duration, survival, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were enrolled; the ORR was 32% (17 complete responses [CR] plus 15 marrow CRs [mCRs]), and the overall improvement rate was 51%, which included 18% HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar response rates were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB subtypes and IPSS risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients who improved, 82% demonstrated responses by the end of cycle 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 33 patients assessable for a cytogenetic response, 17 (52%) experienced cytogenetic CR (n = 11) or partial response (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> given on a 5-day schedule provided meaningful clinical benefit for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with more than half demonstrating improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> can be administered in an outpatient setting with comparable efficacy and safety to the United States Food and Drug Administration-approved inpatient regimen </plain></SENT>
