<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PC-SPES is an eight herbal mixture which has been shown to be active against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cells in vitro as well as in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we discovered that it has anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, NB4, U937 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of PC-SPES (0.06-0.5 micro l/ml) for 4 days, and cell numbers were counted by Trypan blue exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PC-SPES inhibited proliferation of these cells with an ED50 of 0.17, 0.09, 0.18, 0.32 micro l/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In clonogenic assay, PC-SPES inhibited growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells (ED50, 0.043 micro l/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, PC-SPES (0.1 micro l/ml) stimulated growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid committed stem cells (CFU-GM) by 1.4-fold of control (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effects also occurred against freshly isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when PC-SPES was combined with ATRA, the antiproliferative effect was markedly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, PC-SPES (0.125 micro l/ml) or ATRA (10(-8) mol/l) inhibited growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells after 4 days of culture, by approximately 40 and 30%, respectively; simultaneous treatment with both, suppressed growth by 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, PC-SPES induced differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and NB4 cells, as measured by expression of CD11b and reduction of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ATRA synergistically enhanced this activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For example, either PC-SPES (0.5 micro l/ml) or ATRA (10(-8) mol/l) induced 23 and 18% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells, respectively to express CD11b on day 2 of culture; and when both were combined, 60% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells were stimulated to express CD11b antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PC-SPES (0.5 micro l/ml) produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and NB4 cells, as measured by TUNEL assay, with 17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells and 52% of NB4 cells becoming apoptotic on their third day of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Importantly, PC-SPES stimulated expression of the novel myeloid specific transcription factor C/EBPepsilon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and NB4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taken together, PC-SPES inhibits growth and induces differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, and enhances the antiproliferative and prodifferentiative effects of ATRA on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>PC-SPES might be useful with ATRA for treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL), and it could have a role in other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
