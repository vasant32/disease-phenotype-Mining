<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The financial burden of caring for iron-related complications (IRCs) is an emerging medical problem in Korea, as in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced a preliminary estimate of the costs of treating patients for IRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of patients who had received multiple transfusions were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> were defined as IRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The costs of laboratory studies, medication, oxygenation, intervention, and education were calculated using working criteria we defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs that had a definite causal relationship with IRCs were included to produce as accurate an estimate as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2006, 650 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e>, including 358 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 102 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 58 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>, 46 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and 31 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, received more than 10 units of red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients developed IRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary diagnoses of eight patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and that of one patient was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were excluded because one was treated at another hospital and the other was diagnosed as oxymetholone-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients included, liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> developed in two, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in four, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of them had two diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total cost attributed to IRCs for the seven patients was 47,388,241 KRW (approximately 50,000 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The medical costs of IRCs are considerable, and more effective iron-chelating therapy is necessary to save medical resources and improve patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More in the way of comprehensive health and economic studies of IRCs are needed to allow both clinicians and health-policy makers to make better decisions </plain></SENT>
