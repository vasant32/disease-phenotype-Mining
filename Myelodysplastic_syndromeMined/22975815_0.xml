<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 102 specimens from 93 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (52 specimens), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (4), or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (46) were analyzed between April and August, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematogones were detected in 55 specimens and highly identified in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in remission and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage 1 (CD34(+)CD20(-)) and stage 2/3 (CD34(-)CD20(+)) were detected in 9.9% and 52.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the intermediate type (CD34(+)CD20(+)) was identified in 37.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens of stage 3 in bright CD45 expression were positive for CD5 and included CD5(+)CD23(-)CD11c(-), 11.1%, CD5(+)CD23(+)CD11c(-), 85.2%, and CD5(+)CD23(+)CD11c(+), 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that hematogones with unreported immunophenotypes may exist and the appearance of hematogones in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> may be relatively frequent </plain></SENT>
