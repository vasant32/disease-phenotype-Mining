<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed an increase in megakaryocyte count in these patients, whereas the percentage of blast was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase in blood platelet count was accompanied by an increase in serum GM-CSF in a patient with AA, whereas serum IL-6 level was not changed throughout the treatment with IL-1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IL-1 beta may be useful for the treatment of a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA who are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
