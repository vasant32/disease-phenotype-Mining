<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two (73.0%) strains of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (Acb complex) were the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 (3.5%) strains it was impossible to decide whether they belonged to the Acb complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other acinetobacter species were represented by 20 (23.5%) strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The greatest amount (28.2%) of these strains was collected from the Clinic of Internal Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were the most frequent clinical diagnoses (20.0%) of the patients with a positive haemoculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most effective antimicrobial preparations tested were as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43968">meropenem</z:chebi> (98.8% of susceptible strains), colistin (94.1%), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23765">quinolones</z:chebi> (90.6-94.1% according to the type of agent) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2637">amikacin</z:chebi> (91.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Acb complex strains were less susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other acinetobacters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Production of inductive chromosomal beta-lactamases AmpC was proved in 42 (49.4%) strains whilst no occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in the isolated organisms was recorded </plain></SENT>
