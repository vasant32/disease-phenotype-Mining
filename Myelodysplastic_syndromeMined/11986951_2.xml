<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the assumption that this gene may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, we investigated the HTIF1alpha DNA structure and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression in leukemic cells from 36 M1-M5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (28 "de novo" and eight "secondary" to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal HTIF1alpha DNA fragments were never found, whereas loss of HTIF1alpha DNA was observed in the patients with chromosome 7q32 deletion and translocation, and in one case without detectable chromosome 7 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HTIF1alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelocytic leukemic blasts, and was almost undetectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression varied among the patients: higher in M1 to M3 subtypes, with the highest values in M1; low levels were constantly observed in M4 and M5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, HTIF1alpha was significantly overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that HTIF1alpha expression was high in myeloid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In myeloblastic HL60 and promyelocytic NB4 cells, induced to differentiate along the monocytic-macrophage pathway by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>, HTIF1alpha expression decreased, whereas it was maintained at high levels on induction to granulocytic differentiation by RA or DMSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In K562 cells, HTIF1alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels did not change after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-induced erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HTIF1alpha could play a role in myeloid differentiation, being distinctly regulated in hematopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
