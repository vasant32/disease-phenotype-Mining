<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rigorous assessment of the effect of lenalidomide on QTc intervals was conducted in healthy volunteers who each received, in randomized order, a single oral dose of 10 mg lenalidomide, 50 mg lenalidomide, 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control) and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma lenalidomide exposure was compared between healthy volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, moxifloxacin produced the expected significant prolongation in QTcI (individual correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For lenalidomide 10 mg and 50 mg, the time-matched changes from placebo in the baseline-adjusted least-squares mean QTcI were &lt;3 ms with the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the change &lt;10 ms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No subjects experienced QTcI &gt;450 ms or change-from-baseline &gt;60 ms after lenalidomide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen with QT interval data corrected by Fridericia and Bazett methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C-QTc analysis yielded no significant association between lenalidomide concentrations and QTcI changes up to 1522 ng/mL; this range was close to that observed in patients receiving lenalidomide doses up to 50 mg, including those with reduced drug-clearance due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, single doses of lenalidomide up to 50 mg were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc intervals</z:hpo> in healthy males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The C-QTc analysis further assured that lenalidomide doses up to 50 mg are not expected to prolong QTc intervals in patients </plain></SENT>
