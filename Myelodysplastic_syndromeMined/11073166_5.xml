<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results are expressed as the ratio of chimeric bcr-abl transcripts on abl transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Highly reproducible results were obtained for t(9;22)-positive K562 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten copies of bcr-abl DNA from a recombinant KW-3 plasmid and one positive cell in 10(4) can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 25 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 7 with other myeloproliferative syndromes were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained in bcr-abl positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those of conventional nested RT-PCR and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative RT-PCR values correlated well with both these methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in some cases the only means of detecting early relapse or blastic transformation was to examine the kinetics of real-time quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, real-time quantitative RT-PCR appears suitable for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with the t(9;22) translocation </plain></SENT>
