<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is mainly based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several efforts to analyze <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by flow cytometry have been reported in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies have focused on the identification of abnormalities in the maturation pathway of antigen expression of myelo-monocytic cells, and characterization of blast populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, phenotype has been proposed as a diagnostic and prognostic criterion tool for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current article provides data concerning the blast phenotype in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry 26 MDS pediatric patients with more than 2% of blast cells at bone marrow morphological examination (17 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 9 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 145 pediatric de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cases (M3 excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As control group, 12 healthy age-matched donors for allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMD) and 6 regenerating bone marrow samples, collected from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in remission after induction chemotherapy, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a blast immunophenotype typically expressed in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and a strong correlation between CD7 expression and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34+ compartment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow was also analyzed: a significant decrease of B-cell precursors was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the blasts phenotypic features can constitute a diagnostic and prognostic tool also for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
