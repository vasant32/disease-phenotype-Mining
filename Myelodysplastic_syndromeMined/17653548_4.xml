<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, multicolor-FISH and array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were applied to characterize clonal chromosome aberrations in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between January 2004 and December 2005, we prospectively analyzed 90 samples of 73 patients with proven or suspected CBMF disorders enrolled in a German Study Network of CBMF diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal aberrations could be identified in four of 73 patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001905'>congenital thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e>, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, transition into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brother, who was also afflicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e>, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the fourth patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo>, an add(21)(q22) marker containing a low-level amplification of the AML1 gene was identified at the time point of transition into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients </plain></SENT>
