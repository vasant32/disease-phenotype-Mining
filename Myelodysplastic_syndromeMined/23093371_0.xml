<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we employed methylation-specific PCR to examine the methylation status of six Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> genes in 144 MDS patients and in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line SKM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also used real-time PCR to examine the expression of Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> genes and Wnt pathway genes in the SKM-1 cell line after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that methylation of the gene promoters of each of the six genes were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at the following methylation frequencies: 41 % for sFRP1, 89.6 % for sFRP2, 43.1 % for sFRP4, 50.7 % for sFRP5, 44.4 % for DKK-1, and 69.4 % for DKK-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the SKM-1 cell line, the gene promoters sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, DKK-1, and DKK-3 were methylated, while sFRP4 was not methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the SKM-1 cell line with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> induced re-expression of methylated Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and inactivation of the Wnt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed that methylation status of sFRP1, sFRP4, and sFRP5 was associated with worse survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and sFRP5 methylation also predicted a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evolution (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that epigenetic regulation of the Wnt pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line, and the methylation status of Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> predicts prognoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
