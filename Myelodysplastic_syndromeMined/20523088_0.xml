<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survival and late toxicity were analyzed in 55 patients enrolled to receive 4 x adriamycin 60 mg/m(2), 4 x paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2), 4 x <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 800 mg/m(2), every 2 weeks, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50224">cardioxane</z:chebi> and filgrastim support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival analyses were performed according to the presence of casting-type calcifications on the mammogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 78.5 (64.3-100.0) months, 29 (52.7%) patients were free of relapse (local, regional, distant or contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>), 34 (61.8%) patients were free of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and 36 patients (65.5%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median times of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, DDFS and OS were not yet reached at 100.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, DDFS and OS times among <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> not associated with casting-type calcifications were &gt;100.0 months, the corresponding parameters among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> accompanied by casting calcifications were 11.5 (p &lt; 0.001), 11.5 (p &lt; 0.001) and 29.6 months (p = 0.035), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that adjuvant sequential ddATC is an efficient and less toxic chemotherapy regimen in high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of casting-type calcifications on the mammogram points to a special biologic nature with very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
