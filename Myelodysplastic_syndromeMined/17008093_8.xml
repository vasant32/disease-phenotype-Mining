<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receiving standard ABVD (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, vinblastine, and decarbazine) chemotherapy every 14 d were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received one fixed dose of 6 mg pegfilgrastim approximately 24h after each ABVD infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were measured weekly while on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After completion of therapy, ANCs were measured every 3-4 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients received 115 courses (230 doses) of ABVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nadir ANC below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was observed only in two cases (1.1%), and ANC counts on the day of ABVD therapy below 1 x 10(9)/L was observed only once (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifteen (93.5%) doses of ABVD were given on time as scheduled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> was observed after 0.4% of ABVD doses, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> lung toxicity was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 29 months after completion of ABVD, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients relapsed and subsequently underwent successful stem cell collection and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pegfilgrastim was found to be safe in support of ABVD chemotherapy that is administered every 14 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pegfilgrastim was also effective in maintaining ABVD dose intensity, and keeping planned dose of chemotherapy on schedule </plain></SENT>
