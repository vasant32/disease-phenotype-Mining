<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the nature of blast cells in 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> following a previous primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by a combined multiparameter analysis including morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic (Igs, T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, -gamma, and -delta and the major breakpoint cluster region [M-bcr]) investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon analyzing whether the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemias</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> following a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
