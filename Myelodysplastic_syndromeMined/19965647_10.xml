<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1075 patients less than 60 years of age were randomized to receive or not receive ATRA in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/Ara-C/thioguanine chemotherapy with Ara-C at standard or double standard dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were data on FLT3 internal tandem duplications and NPM1 mutations (n = 592), CEBPA mutations (n = 423), and MN1 expression (n = 195) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete remission rate was 68% with complete remission with incomplete count recovery in an additional 16%; 8-year overall survival was 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant treatment effect for any outcome, with no significant interactions between treatment and demographics, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, there were no interactions by FLT3/internal tandem duplications, NPM1, or CEBPA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a suggestion that ATRA reduced relapse in patients with lower MN1 levels, but no significant effect on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were consistent when restricted to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATRA has no overall effect on treatment outcomes in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study did not identify any subgroup of patients likely to derive a significant survival benefit from the addition of ATRA to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
