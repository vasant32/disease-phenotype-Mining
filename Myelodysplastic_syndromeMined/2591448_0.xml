<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating that these remissions are not reached by differentiation induction but through cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In HL60 cells differentiation was measured by a comprehensive panel of quantitative and qualitative markers of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exposure to ARA-C (10(-7) M) for 4 days HL60 cells did not mature morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell volume increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in esterase activity was small and did not reach the amount measured in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in latex phagocytosis and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction between cultures with and without ARA-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HL60 cells were arrested in S-phase and clonogenic capacity persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed changes after exposure to ARA-C seem to be caused by impeded cell division while synthesis of protein continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ARA-C in low dose exerts its effect by halting proliferation through cytotoxic effects and not by differentiation induction </plain></SENT>
