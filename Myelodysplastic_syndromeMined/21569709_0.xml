<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA methylation levels of p15, CDH1, DAPK and HICI in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) samples from 52 MDS patients were detected by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlation of the methylation level with clinical features and hematological findings was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>38 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and 46 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The methylation levels of p15, CDH1, DAPK and HICI were 16.23 ± 21.69, 6.59 ± 9.39, 0.14 ± 0.11 and 7.81 ± 9.70 in BM, and 14.96 ± 20.16, 6.00 ± 9.26, 0.12 ± 0.14 and 6.74 ± 9.72 in PB, respectively from 18 MDS patients, and the difference between BM and PB was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation levels of p15 (14.70 ± 18.17) and CDH1 (6.61 ± 8.79) genes in high risk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBI</z:e>/II) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were significantly higher than in low risk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>/5q-, p15: 1.99 ± 1.59, CDH1: 1.23 ± 1.14 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, p15: 3.02 ± 3.42, CDH1:1.53 ± 2.06) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or control (p15: 1.69 ± 1.82, CDH1: 1.01 ± 1.12) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation levels of DAPK gene had no difference among subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that of HIC1 gene only differed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB I</z:e>/II (9.16 ± 11.95) and control (2.49 ± 2.26) (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference of methylation levels of p15, CDH1, DAPK and HICI in BM was statistically significant among subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.001, 0.003, 0.039, 0.023, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And so did of p15 and DAPK in PB (P = 0.013, 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The methylation level of p15 and CDH1 was significantly correlated with IPSS classification and blasts percentage in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p15 and CDH1 genes are special hypermethylation genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Methylation level of HIC1 gene showed an upward tendency from low risk to high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
