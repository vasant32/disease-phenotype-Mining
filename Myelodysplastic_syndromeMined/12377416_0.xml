<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the first case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (AMMoL) with both t(8;12)(q13;p13) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old woman was initially diagnosed as having AMMoL with t(11;19) (q23;p13) as a sole abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the second relapse, G-banding analysis of the bone marrow cells showed 46,XX,t(11;19)(q23;p13)/46,XX,t(8;12)(q13;p13),t(11;19)(q23;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with chromosome-specific painting probes confirmed both the der(8)t(8;12) and the der(12)t(8;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the MLL/ELL fusion transcript, indicating that the breakpoint on chromosome 19 was 19p13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells at the second relapse were positive for CD2, CD13, CD33, and CD34 but negative for CD14 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient died within 2 months after a subclone with t(8;12)(q13;p13) had appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the literature, t(8;12)(q12;p13) has been observed in two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that t(8;12)(q13;p13) may be one of the recurrent aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, although molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the breakpoints might exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is suggested that t(8;12)(q13;p13) may play an important role in the progression of the disease and lead to the poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
