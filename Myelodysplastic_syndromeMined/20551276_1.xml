<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Array-based genomic platforms have identified copy number alterations in 50% to 70% of bone marrow samples of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, suggesting a diagnostic role for these platforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether blood granulocytes harbor the same copy number alterations as the marrow of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients, 4 had cytogenetic abnormalities shown by conventional karyotyping involving chromosomes 5, 8, 11, 20, and X, and these changes were seen in the granulocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients by using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryptic alterations were identified at a significantly higher level in marrow CD34+ cells compared with granulocytes (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that aCGH analysis of circulating granulocytes may be useful in detecting gross karyotypic alterations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when marrow examination has failed or not been done </plain></SENT>
