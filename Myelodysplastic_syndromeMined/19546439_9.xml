<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is not always straightforward when patients lack specific diagnostic markers, such as blast excess, karyotype abnormality, and ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We designed a flow cytometry protocol applicable in many laboratories and verified its diagnostic utility in patients without those diagnostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardinal parameters, analyzable from one cell aliquot, were myeloblasts (%), B-cell progenitors (%), myeloblast CD45 expression, and channel number of side scatter where the maximum number of granulocytes occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The adjunctive parameters were CD11b, CD15, and CD56 expression (%) on myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow samples from 106 control patients with cytopenia and 134 low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients, including 81 lacking both ringed sideroblasts and cytogenetic aberrations, were prospectively analyzed in Japan and Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data outside the predetermined reference range in 2 or more parameters (multiple abnormalities) were common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those lacking ringed sideroblasts and cytogenetic aberrations, multiple abnormalities were observed in 8/26 Japanese (30.8%) and 37/55 Italians (67.3%) when the cardinal parameters alone were considered, and in 17/26 Japanese (65.4%) and 42/47 Italians (89.4%) when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple abnormalities were rare in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters were used, the diagnostic sensitivities were 65% and 89%, specificities were 98% and 90%, and likelihood ratios were 28.1 and 8.5 for the Japanese and Italian cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This protocol can be used in the diagnostic work-up of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients who lack specific diagnostic markers, although further improvement in diagnostic power is desirable </plain></SENT>
