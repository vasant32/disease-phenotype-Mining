<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) daily for 6 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 4 mg/kg daily for 2 days and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, rabbit) 10 mg/kg daily for 4 days in 11 patients, while one patient received fludarabine, ATG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and thiotepa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 37-59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of blasts in bone marrow aspirate at transplantation was 15% (range &lt;5% to 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis at transplant was RA (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (n = 5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> (n = 5) and sAML (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complex karyotype including <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was noted in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reasons for using a dose-reduced conditioning regimen were prior autologous/syngeneic BMT (n = 4), active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (n = 2) or age/reduced performance status (n = 6) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients died during follow-up due to relapse (n = 4), liver toxicity (n = 2), aspergillus (n = 1) or aGVHD grade IV (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 19 months, the 2-year estimated disease-free survival is 12% (95% CI: 2-23%) and the overall survival is 26% (95% CI: 4-52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine dose-reduced conditioning prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, who were not eligible for standard transplantation, resulted in stable engraftment with complete chimerism, but the toxicity and relapse rate were considerable </plain></SENT>
