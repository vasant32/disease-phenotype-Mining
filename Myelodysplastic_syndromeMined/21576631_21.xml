<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the incidence and prognostic impact of mutations in Additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Overall, 193 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 65 healthy volunteers were examined for ASXL1 mutations by direct sequencing and for expression levels of ASXL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ASXL1 frameshift mutations were associated with a reduced time to progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; HR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.74; P = .017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence, and IDH1 mutation status, ASXL1 frameshift mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (overall survival: HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.34; P = .040; time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression: HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.09; P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ASXL1 mutations are frequent molecular aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that predict an adverse prognostic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening of patients for ASXL1 mutations might be useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future </plain></SENT>
