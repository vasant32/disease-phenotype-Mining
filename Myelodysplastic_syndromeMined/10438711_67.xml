<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase I study that examined the biodistribution of (131)I-labeled anti-CD45 antibody and determined the toxicity of escalating doses of targeted radiation combined with 120 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) followed by HLA-matched related allogeneic or autologous transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> received a biodistribution dose of 0.5 mg/kg (131)I-BC8 (murine anti-CD45) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> estimated radiation absorbed dose (centigray per millicurie of (131)I) delivered to bone marrow and spleen was 6.5 +/- 0.5 and 13.5 +/- 1.3, respectively, with liver, lung, kidney, and total body receiving lower amounts of 2.8 +/- 0.2, 1.8 +/- 0.1, 0.6 +/- 0.04, and 0.4 +/- 0.02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (84%) had favorable biodistribution of antibody, with a higher estimated radiation absorbed dose to marrow and spleen than to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients received a therapeutic dose of (131)I-antibody labeled with 76 to 612 mCi (131)I to deliver estimated radiation absorbed doses to liver (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organ receiving the highest dose) of 3.5 Gy (level 1) to 12.25 Gy (level 6) in addition to CY and TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose was level 5 (delivering 10.5 Gy to liver), with grade III/IV mucositis in 2 of 2 patients treated at level 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 25 treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 7 survive disease-free 15 to 89 months (median, 65 months) posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 9 treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 3 survive disease-free 19, 54, and 66 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (131)I-anti-CD45 antibody can safely deliver substantial supplemental doses of radiation to bone marrow (approximately 24 Gy) and spleen (approximately 50 Gy) when combined with conventional CY/TBI </plain></SENT>
