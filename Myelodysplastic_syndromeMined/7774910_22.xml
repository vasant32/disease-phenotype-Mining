<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The E2F transcription factor plays an important regulatory role in cell proliferation, mediating the expression of genes whose products are essential for inducing resting cells to enter the cell cycle and synthesize DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible involvement of E2F in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e>, we isolated genomic clones encompassing the human E2F1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize E2F1 to human chromosome 20q11, telomeric to the p107 locus, a gene whose product is related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene product (pRb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding contrasts with the 1p36 and 6q22 chromosomal locations previously assigned E2F2 and E2F3, two additional members of the E2F family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although deletions or structural rearrangements of E2F1 were not detected in 14 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> samples with structural abnormalities of chromosome 20q11, the gene was amplified and overexpressed in HEL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cells and translocated to other chromosomes in several established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence of gene amplification involving a member of the E2F family of transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that E2F1 overexpression in erythroid progenitors may stimulate <z:mp ids='MP_0000350'>abnormal cell proliferation</z:mp> by overriding negative regulatory signals mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor proteins such as pRb </plain></SENT>
