<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> gene WT1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that is inactivated in a subset of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">kidney cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During embryogenesis, WT1 is expressed in a time- and tissue-specific manner in various organs including gonads and kidney but also in the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although widely regarded as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> WT1 is overexpressed in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, most notably in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction of WT1 expression levels leads to decrease of proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of leukemic cells, suggesting that in certain contexts WT1 might act as an oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) can promptly and dramatically downregulate Wt1 expression levels in different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was mostly due to the cessation of transcription and was mediated by sequences located in intron 3 of Wt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, TSA also caused enhanced degradation of the Wt1 protein by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was at least in part due to induction of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, downregulation of Wt1 expression might contribute to the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors that are currently used in clinical trials as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapeutics </plain></SENT>
