<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aregeneratoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (AA) occurs rarely after ABO-incompatible allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT), and its management is generally difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a 31-year-old white man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who developed AA after receiving stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical, but ABO-incompatible sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because his anti-A antibody titers were high, therapy with conventional doses of erythropoietin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> failed to treat the AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following 8 cycles of plasma exchange and higher doses of erythropoietin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> administration, anti-A titers decreased, and his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, to treat and obtain a low titer of antibodies in a patient with AA following an ABO-incompatible alloPBSCT, higher doses of erythopoietin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> associated with plasma exchange have to be used </plain></SENT>
