<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a heterogenous group of haematopoietic stem cell disorders that are multifactorial in their aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unique genetic alterations in combinations or in isolation account for a small fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suggesting the epigenetic hypermethylation as a possible leading cause for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, promoter hypermethylation status of key cell cycle regulators was assessed as markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and association of hypermethylation with clinical progression of disease was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Promoter hypermethylation analysis of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> associated genes namely p16, p15, MGMT, hMLH1 and E-cadherin were done for 41 MDS patient samples with its various subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypermethylation analysis was done by using semi-nested multiplex PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty per cent of (33/41) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples were found to be methylated in any one of the four genes (p16, p15, MGMT and E-cadherin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p15 methylation was found to be the most frequent 61 per cent (25/41), E-cadherin was methylated in 39 per cent (16/41) and p16 in 37 per cent (15/41) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MGMT gene showed a low 5 per cent (2/41) methylation whereas hMLH1 gene was not methylated in any one of the samples analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: Differential rate of methylation of the four genes (p16, p15, MGMT and E-cadherin) was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the samples analysed showed the absence of a methylator phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these genes increased with the clinical severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, hypermethylation may be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in ascertaining the clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
