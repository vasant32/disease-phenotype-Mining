<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 286 canine clinical bone marrow reports evaluated retrospectively, 13 (4.5%) noted at least 3% hemophagocytic macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Macrophages comprised between 6% and 44% of nucleated bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnoses for dogs with hemophagocytic disorders included malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 4), round cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (n = 2), immune-mediated disorders (n = 2), and idiopathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of benign and malignant forms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> was problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two dogs with a diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> had macrophages with atypical features similar to those described for malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only 2 of 11 dogs with presumably benign hemophagocytic disorders had exclusively mature macrophages in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other dogs had variable numbers of large reticular-type cells characterized by lacy chromatin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011273'>anisocytosis</z:hpo>, anisokaryosis, and prominent and/or multiple nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, cytomorphologic evaluation of bone marrow alone may not be adequate to consistently differentiate benign and malignant forms of hemophagocytic disorders </plain></SENT>
