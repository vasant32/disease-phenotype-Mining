<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analyses of complementary DNA and genomic clones of CD14 show that it has a novel structure and that it maps to chromosome 5 within a region containing other genes encoding growth factors and receptors; it may therefore represent a new receptor important for myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the CD14 gene is included in the "critical" region that is frequently deleted in certain myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
