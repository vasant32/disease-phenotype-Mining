<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>Mastocytosis</z:hpo> is a rare clonal disorder that might be accompanied by non-mast-cell clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>, such as myeloproliferative or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to further understand the pathologic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> and to identify novel molecular markers of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> preparations obtained from bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with gene expression profiles performed on bone marrow mononuclear cells of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of gene expression in neoplastic bone marrow tissues revealed highly consistent profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred four genes were significantly upregulated, and 64 genes were significantly downregulated in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prominent differentially expressed gene was alpha-tryptase (44.6-fold increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also upregulated were genes involved in cell proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both hierarchical and K-means clustering analyses identified an identical group of 10 genes highly coordinately overexpressed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, including genes for the mast-cell-associated enzymes alpha- and beta-tryptase and carboxypeptidase A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression level of 3 of these 10 genes (alpha-tryptase, the activating transcription factor type 3, and the muscle aponeurotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> type F oncogene) was significantly correlated with serum tryptase levels, a surrogate marker of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data presented in this study reveal significant differences in gene expression in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> compared with healthy subjects, demonstrate highly coordinated genes that might contribute to pathology, and identify 3 genes as candidate molecular markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
