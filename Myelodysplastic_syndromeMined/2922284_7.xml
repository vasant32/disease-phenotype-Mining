<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four patients we have previously localized the breakpoints in band 7q22 between the erythropoietin (EPO) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PLANH1) genes that map 3 cM apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pro alpha 2(I) collagen (COL1A2, in band 7q22) and T cell receptor beta chain genes (TCRB, in band 7q35) have been found undeleted in one patient with an interstitial deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to map the breakpoints more accurately in two patients with a 7q- chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that lymphocytes and granulocytes give identical restriction patterns with several enzyme-probe combinations, and that a breakpoint possibly was within 195 kb of EPO in one patient but not in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene order cen-COL1A2-EPO-breakpoint-tel was suggested but physical linkage between COL1A2 and EPO was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new putative TCRB restriction fragment length polymorphism or inherited methylation site was detected </plain></SENT>
