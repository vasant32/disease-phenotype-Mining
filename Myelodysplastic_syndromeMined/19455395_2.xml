<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted the first study to assess the prognostic role of neighborhood SES among a cohort of 2,118 patients (age &gt;/= 66 years) who were diagnosed with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the United States during 2001-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis was used to develop a summary SES score by combining multiple measures of neighborhood SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The score was then used to classify the census tract each patient resided in into a category of high, medium, or low SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and histological subtypes, compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients lived in high-SES census tracts, those resided in medium (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.30) and low (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02-1.34) SES census tracts had significantly increased the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of SES on survival was more apparent for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>-patients residing in medium (HR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.17-2.91) and low (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.27-3.37) census tracts had a nearly two-fold increased the risk of mortality, compared with those living in high-SES census tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this population-based study suggests that neighborhood SES status is a significant and independent determinant of survival among elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the United States </plain></SENT>
