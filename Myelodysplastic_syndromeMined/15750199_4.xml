<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research has mainly focused on the cellular events, but the bone marrow matrix has attracted minor interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study bone marrow biopsies were obtained from 35 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrows were analyzed regarding the occurrence and distribution of hyaluronan (HYA) and reticulin fibers (type III collagen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow sections were analyzed histochemically and compared with bone marrows from 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HYA staining was significantly stronger in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient demonstrated abnormal reticulin staining score, but in the group of patients with antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the reticulin staining score was significantly higher compared with the patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the HYA staining and reticulin staining scores in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients as was seen in the control group </plain></SENT>
