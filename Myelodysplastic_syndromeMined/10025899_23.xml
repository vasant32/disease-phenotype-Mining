<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two main types of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (tAML) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (tMDS) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first classical type typically occurs late after use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and presents as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with -7/del 7q and/or -5/del5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second form occurs early after the use of agents targeted at topoisomerase II, and presents as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with 11q23 or other rearrangements of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we and others reported, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a strong correlation between cytogenetic rearrangements leading to 17p deletion, a specific type of dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation; several of those cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">17p- syndrome</z:e> were therapy-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the last 15 years, we observed 25 cases of tAML and tMDS with 17p deletion, which represented 36% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with 17p deletion diagnosed during that period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had tMDS and four tAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typical dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation and/or overexpression were seen in 22 of 24 and 16 of 19 evaluable patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>17p deletion resulted from unbalanced translocations involving 17p (18 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 (five cases), i(17q) (one case) or del 17p (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients also had -5/del 5q, and/or -7/del 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median interval from treatment of the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of tAML and tMDS was 94 months (range 19-252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survival was only 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> used, patients could be relatively well divided into two groups: a first group of 11 cases, occurring mainly after a lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (eight cases) treated by chemotherapy with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> (10 cases), and a second group of 14 cases occurring after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) treated mainly by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (10 cases), pipobroman (eight cases), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> (six cases) but rarely by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>-7/del 7q was found in 10 of the 11 patients in the first group, as compared to three of the 14 patients of the second group (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapy-related cases represent a high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">17p- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They have many features in common with classical tMDS and tAML, including long interval from the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, a usual preleukemic phase, and frequent occurrence of -5/del 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>About one half of them, in addition, occur after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and generally carry -7/del 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The other half, however, occur mainly after ET or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> or other non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and usually have no -7/del 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings bring further support to a possible relationship between prior drugs used and cytogenetic rearrangements in tAML and tMDS </plain></SENT>
