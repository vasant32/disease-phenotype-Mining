<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether currently accepted cytogenetic risk groups, which were established for patients treated mostly with standard therapy, are optimally discriminating for patients undergoing HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, the impact of cytogenetics in the growing population of patients with therapy-related disease has not been completely elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively analyzed data on 556 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transplanted at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined, in multivariate analyses, the contribution of cytogenetics to survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality for the 476 patients with de novo disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used these results to establish an optimal cytogenetic grouping scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then applied this grouping scheme to the 80 patients with therapy-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our proposed 3-group cytogenetic classification outperformed the established grouping schemes for both de novo and therapy-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When classified by this new scheme, cytogenetics was the strongest prognostic factor for overall survival in our cohort, through its impact on the risk of relapse (and not on nonrelapse mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After accounting for cytogenetics, patients with therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had an equivalent outcome to those with de novo disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the impact of cytogenetics on the risk of relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for patients with both de novo and therapy-related disease undergoing transplantation; it also emphasizes the necessity of using cytogenetics to stratify patients entering clinical trials, and provides a system for doing so, which can be validated in a multi-institutional database </plain></SENT>
