<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With disease progression evaluated by the FAB classification this parameter decreased significantly for both the immature myelo- and erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the proliferative activity of the mature myelopoiesis defined by the CD66 antigen revealed no difference between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using another assay simultaneously labelling bone marrow cells for three leucocyte differentiation antigens during treatment with GM-CSF and low-dose AraC the cells clearly differentiated in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another patient the disease seemed to progress as evaluated by cells only expressing immature antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above mentioned immunophenotypic changes persisted at least one month after termination of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the evaluation of proliferation and differentiation of leucocyte subsets using multiparameter flowcytometric assays in myelodysplastic patients from different FAB groups before as well as during treatment with haemopoietic growth factors may prove valuable in the future </plain></SENT>
