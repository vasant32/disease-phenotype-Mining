<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>Hemolysis</z:mp> as a result of donor-recipient minor ABO mismatching is a complication of allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation (PBPCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased B-lymphocyte content of PBPC grafts and immunosuppressive regimens without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) may increase incidence and severity of this event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients were analyzed after allogeneic PBPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 25 (27%) cases, minor (n=21) or bidirectional (n=4) ABO mismatching was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 15 patients received myeloablative and 10 received nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For GVHD, prophylaxis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) alone (n=2) or CsA with MTX (n=13) was given after myeloablative conditioning and CsA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) after nonmyeloablative conditioning (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>Hemolysis</z:mp> occurred in 4 out of 25 (16%) patients with minor or bidirectional ABO mismatching only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning and were given CsA with MMF, and one patient underwent myeloablative conditioning and was given CsA alone for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>Hemolysis</z:mp> began 7 to 10 days after transplantation, and donor type alloantibodies were detectable concomitantly with recipients type RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients receiving minor or bidirectional ABO-mismatched PBPC grafts and GVHD prophylaxis without MTX are at risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic interventions in patients before minor ABO-mismatched PBPCT not receiving MTX should be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful monitoring of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> parameters during the first 15 days after PBPCT transplantation is mandatory </plain></SENT>
