<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: In patients with unexplained cytopenias, abnormal karyotyping studies can be found with inconclusive light microscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multidimensional flow cytometry (FCM) can identify myelomonocytic cells with aberrant phenotypes often not seen by standard <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: In 431 patients presenting with unexplained cytopenia(s) FCM results were compared to abnormal karyotyping and FISH results recognized as associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in the 2008 WHO classification, to assess the degree of and types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> observed using a previously reported flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence activated cell sorting was also used to identify subpopulations of abnormal maturing myelomonocytic cells that carry the genotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: For marrows with complex (three or more karyotypic abnormalities), two abnormalities, isolated chromosome seven anomalies, del(5q) or del(13q), 100% of cases were positive when using a FCSS cutoff of ≥2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8, del(20q), and minus Y had flow scores ≥2 in 72, 60, and 18%, respectively, but in some cases the flow score was high, indicating myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients (16/22) with high myeloid progenitor cells (MyPC) (&gt;20%) also exhibited maturing myeloid cell abnormalities by FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> was negative in the maturing myeloid cells in many cases with phenotypically abnormal myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The high correlation between genotypic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> suggests a possible increased utility of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of patients with unexplained cytopenias and may be useful in future clinical studies and in the classification by the WHO, using the FCSS rather than simple counting of flow cytometric abnormalities. © 2010 International Clinical Cytometry Society </plain></SENT>
