<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation cytoreduction with induction chemotherapy (IC) has been used to reduce relapse rates but is associated with significant toxicity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylating agents may achieve cytoreduction with limited toxicity; however, data on the effect of pre-HCT hypomethylation on post-HCT outcomes are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed results in 68 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had received cytoreduction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> before HCT with either a high-dose (40%) or a reduced-intensity (60%) conditioning regimen, and 33 had undergone IC before HCT with high-dose conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated 1-year overall survival (OS) was 57% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> group and 36% in the IC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of post-HCT mortality (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.30), nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-2.34), and relapse (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-2.34) were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> group compared to the IC group, but only the hazard for relapse was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for cytogenetic risk, International Prognostic Scoring System, and donor, the rates of post-HCT relapse for the 2 cohorts were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the current study was retrospective and nonrandomized and needs to be interpreted in this context, the results add to the growing evidence that pre-HCT therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> is associated with less toxicity than IC and may allow for similar post-HCT outcomes </plain></SENT>
