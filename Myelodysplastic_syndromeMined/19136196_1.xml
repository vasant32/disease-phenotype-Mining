<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The capacity of mononuclear blood cells to form autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes was investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism of successful immunosuppressive therapy in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients (autoreactivity studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The failure in autoreactivity studies raised the question of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (alloreactivity studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and relevant controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoreactive lymphocytes directed against autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and alloreactive lymphocytes directed against unrelated third-party cells were tested using cytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction, human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor test for clonality detection, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and interferon-gamma testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not confirm the presence of autoreactive T cells in eight of nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response to allogeneic cells was impaired in 11 of 16 MDS patients, more often in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA; 80%) than in RA with ring sideroblasts (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the response to allogeneic cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes were polyclonal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and interferon-gamma level in supernatants of mononuclear cells was significantly reduced in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presumed autoaggressive T cells were not confirmed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in our experimental arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alloreactivity studies demonstrated the impairment of effector cytotoxic phase of cell-mediated immunological reaction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, namely in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The significance of our finding of defective cytotoxicity for pathogenesis, clinical course, and even for therapy is discussed together with other immunological defects reported so far </plain></SENT>
