<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of comorbidity prognostic score systems applied in our population of patients. as well as other clinical-biological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively considered the outcome of 120 patients aged &gt;65 years diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> between January 2001 and December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities were evaluated by using Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), Hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCTCI) and a score proposed by Dombret et al. in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy and 23 reached a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four patients received only supportive therapies or low-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.0013), antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (p = 0.011), FLT3 abnormalities (p = 0.032), CCI (p = 0.0037) and Dombret et al. score (p = 0.045) as independent prognostic parameters for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these variables we were able to stratify patients in low and high risk, with different median overall survival: patients were considered as low risk if they had none or only one of the above mentioned adverse factors for survival, with a median overall survival of 447 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with two or more adverse factors were categorized as high risk: this subgroup had a median overall survival of 227 days (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities are independent factors that influence survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Application of CCI and Dombret score may help to better identify patients at diagnosis who can benefit from intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
