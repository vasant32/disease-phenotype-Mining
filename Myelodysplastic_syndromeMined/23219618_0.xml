<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under various pathological conditions impairs <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal and causes <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> senescence, and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence, which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells enriched with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the percentages of SA-Î²-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> positive senescent CD34(+) cells increased in lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but not in higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, compared to that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells enriched with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> progression from lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> present p21 dependent premature senescence, increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could contribute to this process; however, CD34(+) cells from patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence </plain></SENT>
