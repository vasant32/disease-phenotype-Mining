<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown in a study of 55 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL 21, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 20 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 14), that patients who demonstrate increase amounts of autologous marrow repopulation (increasing mixed chimerism) have a significantly enhanced risk of relapse (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we asked whether post-transplant relapse can be prevented by withdrawal of immunosuppression and/or by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe the results of a pilot study where adoptive immunotherapy was used to treat 12 patients (five ALL, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who showed increasing mixed chimerism (MC) post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A response to immunotherapy, defined as the re-establishment of complete chimerism (CC) and continuous complete remission (CCR), was achieved in four patients (two ALL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following withdrawal of CsA and in a further six patients (three ALL, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) after additional DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One ALL patient, who initially responded to DLI, developed severe GVHD that required further immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GVHD was controlled but this patient subsequently relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another patient with ALL became a CC but developed an isolated relapse in the bone marrow 260 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed severe GVHD after DLI and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two children (one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) did not show any response to interventional treatment and died due to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients treated, seven remain in CCR at a median follow-up of 747 days (range 351-1109 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, these results provide evidence that increasing MC can be used to guide adoptive immunotherapy strategies and that these treatment modalities can be used to prevent relapse in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
