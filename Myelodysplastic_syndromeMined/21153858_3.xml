<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches that target the epigenetic mechanisms implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the acetylation status of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> has been linked to transcriptional regulation of genes involved particularly in differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, DAC inhibitors (DACi) have attracted considerable attention for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DACi encompass a structurally diverse family of compounds that are being explored as single agents as well as in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, small molecule inhibitors of signaling pathways and hypomethylating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While DACi have shown clear evidence of activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, their precise role in treatment of these different entities remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful development of these compounds as elements of novel targeted treatment strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> will require that clinical studies be performed in conjunction with translational research including efforts to identify predictive biomarkers </plain></SENT>
