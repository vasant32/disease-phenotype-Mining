<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a phase II pilot study of dose-intensive adjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> followed sequentially by high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> to determine the safety and feasibility of this dose-dense treatment and to estimate the disease-free and overall survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients received adjuvant treatment with four cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 75 mg/m(2) as an intravenous bolus every 21 days, followed by three cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 3,000 mg/m(2) every 14 days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were assessable, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> planned chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicity was neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, which occurred in 39% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free survival is 66 months (95% confidence interval, 34 to 98 months), and median overall survival has not yet been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 5 years of follow-up, the disease-free survival is 51.7%, and overall survival is 60.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no long-term treatment-related toxicity, and no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our pilot study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the sequential dose-dense plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up, although noncomparative, is promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this regimen is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity (and also higher costs) than the standard dose and schedule of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and therefore it should not be used as conventional therapy in the absence of demonstrated improvement of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials testing the dose-dense approach have been completed but not yet reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the sequential plan can decrease overlapping toxicities, it is an appropriate platform for the addition of newer active agents, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxanes</z:chebi> or monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
