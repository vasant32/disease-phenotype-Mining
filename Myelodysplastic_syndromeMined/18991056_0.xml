<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) can be detected in a substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive analysis of the chromosomal rearrangements in these CCAs has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cytogenetics (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) is a new generation FISH technique which allows simultaneous identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 24 human chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So it is very useful in clarifying CCAs, identifying cryptic interchromosomal rearrangements and characterizing marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But it also has some limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used M-FISH and whole chromosome painting (WCP) to accurately refine the CCAs revealed by R-banding CC in seven cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The composition and origin of 6 kinds of marker chromosomes, nine kinds of chromosomes with additional material undetermined and five kinds of derivative chromosomes undefined by CC were defined after M-FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four kinds of cryptic translocations overlooked by CC were found on derivative chromosomes and previously <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, M-FISH revealed some nonrandom aberrations which most frequently involved chromosome 17 (5/7) and -5/5q-(4/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence flaring is a main factor leading to misinterpretations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH were corrected by WCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>M-FISH is a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool in clarification of CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complementary WCP can further identify misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CC in combination with molecular cytogenetic techniques including M-FISH and WCP can more precisely unravel CCAs </plain></SENT>
