<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the available evidence indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is among the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In a previous study, we showed that incidence rates rose from 1 to 4.1 in the period 1976-1990, with no increase between 1986 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We extended our study, covering the years 1991 through 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria and cytomorphology remained the same, consistently applying the criteria of the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three-hundred and eight new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were identified in the town district of Düsseldorf, which provides the reference population for calculating incidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no further rise in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence in the period 1991-2001 was 4.9 (5.52 in males, 4.36 in females), which is similar to that in the 1986-1990 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age specific incidences were 8.7, 24.5, and 31.3 for the age groups 60-70, 71-80, and 80-90, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the age group &gt;70 years was significantly higher among males (42.3) than among females (19.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preponderance of males was found among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (16 vs 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (7 vs 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (15 vs 6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (7 vs 2), whereas, somewhat surprisingly, the age-related incidences <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> was similar for males and females (4 vs 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence in the town district of Düsseldorf showed a plateau since 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Interpreting our data covering a 26-year period, we feel that the increase in the early years primarily reflected improved case ascertainment, whereas our new data may provide a good approximation of the true incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence that the age-adjusted incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is rising </plain></SENT>
