<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses include <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=43), non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=30), Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=3), ALL (n=2) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the entire cohort, the disease-free survival (DFS) and OS were 61.2 and 35.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients relapsed, 18 within the first three years, and 14 patients succumbed to progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 31 patients died from transplant-related complications within the first three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Day 100 non-relapse mortality correlated with a higher total nucleated cell dose in the graft (odds ratio: 3.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those in CR at 3 years, the DFS and OS were 84.2 and 81.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, of 43 patients with active disease at the time of transplantation, 16 remained in CR after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the long-term survivors were functioning independently </plain></SENT>
