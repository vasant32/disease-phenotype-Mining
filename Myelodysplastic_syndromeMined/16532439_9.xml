<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The current study describes what to the authors' knowledge is the first large case series reported to date of 26 t(3;21)(q26;q22)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, in which 24 cases arose after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional G-band karyotyping and flow cytometry immunophenotyping were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect fusion transcripts between AML1 and EAP, MDS1, or EVI1, followed by DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, including 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), the occurrence of t(3;21) heralded myeloid blast transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (93%) patients had been previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e>) were found to have t(3;21) with t(9;22) as the sole cytogenetic abnormality; in 5 other patients this was accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 10 cases of t(3;21)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 8 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumors</z:e> after chemotherapy for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that had been treated with regimens including fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> in 3 patients each and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of the blasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 tested cases was similar, with uniform expression of myeloid markers and CD34 and variable expression of CD7 and CD9, but minimal morphological myeloid maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic micromegakaryocytes and bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed predominantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing showed that the AML1-/MDS1-/EVI1 (AME) fusion transcript was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 cases assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e>, 8 died of disease (at a median of 6.5 mos) and 5 achieved disease remission with bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 7 died of disease (at a median of 2 mos) and 2 had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activation of AME through t(3;21) defines a highly aggressive, therapy-related leukemic blast syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prior treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> or other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolites</z:chebi> is implicated as a contributory cause </plain></SENT>
