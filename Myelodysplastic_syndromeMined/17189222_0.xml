<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, t(5; 17)(q13;q11), although relatively rare, has been reported to be a component of complex chromosomal abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated a 29-year-old woman with the first reported case of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AMML Eo</z:e> with inv(16)(p13q22) in addition to t(5; 17)(q13;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although she attained complete remission (CR) immediately after induction therapy, the disease recurred 1 year after the completion of consolidation therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She underwent HLA-matched unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (UBMT), together with a myeloablative conditioning regimen, after achieving a second CR and has survived without a recurrence for more than 24 months since UBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, certain secondary chromosomal abnormalities are associated with the phenotype of the disease, which retains its essential biologic characteristics established by the primary abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the primary nature of the leukemic cells in this case differs from the findings for core-binding factor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with inv(16)(p13q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe this report is the first of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AMML Eo</z:e> with t(5; 17)(q13;q11) showing as a secondary chromosomal aberration with inv(16)(p13q22) </plain></SENT>
