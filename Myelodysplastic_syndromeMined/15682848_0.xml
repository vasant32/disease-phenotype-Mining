<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 14 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of the bone marrow scintigraphy tracer was classified according to the degree of accumulation in the axial bone marrow and peripheral expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which are frequently used for prognostic evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were investigated in prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the relationship between enlargement of the liver and spleen and the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accumulation patterns were as follows: pattern I, The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> accumulation pattern (2 cases); pattern II, the expanded accumulation pattern (6 cases); pattern III, low accumulation pattern (5 cases); and pattern IV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> accumulation pattern (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationships between the two prognostic factors and accumulation patterns were investigated, and the prognosis was found to be significantly poorer in the patients with the low accumulation pattern than the expanded accumulation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of the liver and spleen was not significantly correlated with the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
