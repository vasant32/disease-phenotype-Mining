<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former two (1 and 2) can be referred to as nonleukemic patterns and latter two (3 and 4) as leukemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a search for a role for cytokines in leukemic-type growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells, marrow CD34+ cells were purified up to 94% for 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 88% for 12 MDS patients, using monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic microspheres (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days with various combinations of cytokines, including recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3), and stem cell factor (SCF; a ligand for c-kit) in serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clonal growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells supported by a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above cytokines was subdivided into the two patterns of leukemic or nonleukemic, and then the role of individual or combined cytokines in proliferation and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells was analyzed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence we obtained showed that SCF plays a central role in the leukemic-type growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells and that G-CSF, GM-CSF; and/or IL-3 synergize with SCF to increase undifferentiated blast cell colonies and clusters over that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCF is present in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> plasma at a level of nanograms per milliliter, and this physiologic concentration of SCF can stimulate progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This means that progenitor cells are continuously exposed to stimulation by SCF in vivo and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> leukemic cells have a growth advantage over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This depends, at least in part, on cytokines such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and SCF </plain></SENT>
