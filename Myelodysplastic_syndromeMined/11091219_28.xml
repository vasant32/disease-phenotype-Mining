<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The projected 10-year survival rates were 55 +/- 8% and 97 +/- 3% respectively (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the IST group included 11 non-responders who were salvaged by BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor, we compared failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> at 10 years was 97 +/- 3% for the BMT group, compared with 40 +/- 8% for the IST group (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and the estimated cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 10 years after diagnosis was 20 +/- 7% in the IST group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the outcome of children treated with IST during the two consecutive periods of 1983-91 (group A, n = 40) and 1991-8 (group B, n = 23) to assess the impact of combined therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> at 7 years follow-up was the same in the two groups (50 +/- 8% vs. 40 +/- 15%, P = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend BMT as first-line therapy in paediatric severe AA patients with an HLA-matched family donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternative donor BMT is recommended as salvage therapy in patients who relapse or do not respond to initial IST </plain></SENT>
