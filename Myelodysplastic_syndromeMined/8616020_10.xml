<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of our patients was 4 months (range 1-89), as was the median survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 30% of the cases there was a history of preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or previous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and cytogenetic remission was obtained in 7/36 patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of 7q- detection, three patients previously treated with CT for ANLL were in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5q- was the most recurrent associated abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotypes were observed in 68% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, statistical differences in survival were observed according to diagnosis (therapy-related and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary diseases</z:e> had a worse prognosis than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disorders</z:e>), the chromosomal segments deleted (the loss of band 7q32 was of poor prognostic value), the karyotype complexity (patients with single anomalies did better than patients with complex anomalies) and the response to therapy (patients who achieved complete remission had a better survival probability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the loss of band 7q32 was found to be significantly related to very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that band 7q32 may contain critical genes that should be explored at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
