<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a preliminary observation that colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-responsive myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) from a few patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) did not respond to the costimulating effects of SLF, we evaluated responsiveness of bone marrow or blood CFU-GM from 26 patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to the effects in vitro of SLF and/or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients responded to the stimulating effects of GM-CSF, but marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was detected in each disease category to the costimulating effects of SLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 2 of 6 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 4 of 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had clonogenic cells that did not respond significantly to the costimulating effects of SLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a more limited study of cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it was noted that if the CFU-GM of that patient did not respond to SLF enhancement of CSF-induced colony formation, neither did the erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent erythroid (BFU-E) or multipotential (CFU-GEMM) cells of that patient (3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> [RA] evaluating bone marrow and in 1 case blood progenitors as well) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If CFU-GM responded, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM responded (bone marrow from 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [CMMol]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical criteria did not readily distinguish between patients who had SLF-responsive vs. -nonresponsive clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the mechanistic reason for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in responsiveness is not clear, these differences should be carefully considered for possible clinical trials with SLF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
