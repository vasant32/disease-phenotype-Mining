<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using synthetic oligonucleotide hybridization, we have found a ras mutation in 11 of 27 patients (41%) with primary or non-therapy related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This high incidence of mutation, mainly of the N-ras oncogene, was generally found in patients with disease progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (8 of 11 patients = 73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two general mechanisms of ras mutation were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five patients the ras mutation was present in only a fraction of the cells; sometimes appearing in late stages of the disease, suggesting that it can occur in a differentiated cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six other patients, the ras mutation was present in the great majority of bone marrow or blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation was detected in mature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and persisted following a complete clinical remission in two of these patients, implying that the ras mutation can occur in an early stage of cell differentiation or stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a ras mutation had a median survival of nine months (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients dead) compared to 16 patients without a ras mutation that had a median follow-up of 16 months (10 patients alive; P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since 9 of the 11 patients (82%) with a ras mutation were found to have an abnormal monocytic component at diagnosis or during disease evolution, it is possible that in myeloid disorders a ras mutation is preferentially associated with myelomonocytic cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
