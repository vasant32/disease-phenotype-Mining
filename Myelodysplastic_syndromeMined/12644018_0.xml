<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are characterized by peripheral cytopenia and ineffective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in certain inherited marrow failure syndromes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is increased and is mediated mainly through activation of the Fas pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the various <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> share the same <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>I investigated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways in a patient with refractory cytopenia with ring sideroblasts associated with congenital 4p deletion to determine the mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Marrow cells and lymphoblast cell lines generated from peripheral blood were analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and protein expression by flow cytometry, Western blot, and confocal microscopy, either directly or after gamma irradiation (15 G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability after treatment with inhibitors of specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, the patient's marrow and lymphoblastoid cells showed significantly higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates and activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway showed a consistent pro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> profile, namely, upregulation of Bax, Bax-alpha, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and Apaf1, and low bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences between the patient's and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells were further accentuated after irradiation; p53 expression was strikingly higher in the patient only after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Fas and FADD expression on the patient's and the control's cells were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of caspase 3 or caspase 9 inhibitors markedly increased patient cell viablity, but blocking anti-Fas antibody did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ineffective hematopoiesis in this case is explained by <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and is linked to hyperactivation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> machinery and not to the Fas pathway, which might be secondary to an intramitochondrial defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This information is crucial because the development of anti-apoptotic agents for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may not be universally efficacious and should target the specific derangement </plain></SENT>
