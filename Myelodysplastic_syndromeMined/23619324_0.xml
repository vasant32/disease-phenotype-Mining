<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is characterized by peripheral cytopenias and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in one or more cell lines in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of patients require blood product support due to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> during the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was planned to evaluate the transfusion requirement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the role of ferritin in predicting transfusion requirement and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 35 MDS patients [median age: 66 (22-84); male/female: 21/14] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria was used for disease classification and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (62.8%) required transfusions during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 22 patients received packed red blood cells (PRBCs), only 8 patients (22.9%) required platelet transfusion(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no significant relationship was demonstrated between transfusion dependency and disease progression, patients who responded to disease-specific treatment were exposed to less PRBC transfusions compared to non-responders (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment response was found to be better in patients who had lower serum ferritin levels at diagnosis (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients were followed for a minimum of 24months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfusion load was not different among these patients with respect to disease subtype, IPSS risk score and treatment protocol in the first and second 12-month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival of the cohort was 26.3 (0.4-160.3) months and median progression free survival was 24.9 (0.4-160.3) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present report underlines the association of baseline hyperferritinemia and transfusion dependency with treatment success in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even in patients treated with new generation agents, the vicious impact of transfusion load seems to be the tender spot of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> puzzle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of baseline hyperferritinemia should be validated with further studies </plain></SENT>
