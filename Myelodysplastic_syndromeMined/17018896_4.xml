<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study of 284 MDS patients, we identified 32 patients (11.3%) with clinical or serologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> (group A) and compared them to the remaining 252 cases (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A consisted of 20 patients with clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and 12 asymptomatic patients with serologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from significant female predominance in group A (M/F = 2.5 vs M/F = 0.7, p = 0.001), the other clinical and biological features such as median age, distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes, incidence of karyotyopic abnormalities, "abnormal" in vitro growth of GM-progenitors and survival times were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune manifestations partially responded to immunosuppressive therapy, with moderate improvement of peripheral cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), and CD56(+) cells were quantified in peripheral blood of 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matched with similarly aged healthy control group, most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo>, mainly due to the reduction of T-helper series (in both absolute numbers and percentage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-cells were reduced in absolute numbers, but their percentage still overlapped with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major abnormalities of natural killer cells (CD56(+)) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and asymptomatic immunologic abnormalities are common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but except for female predominance, no correlation between these abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-specific disease features were found </plain></SENT>
