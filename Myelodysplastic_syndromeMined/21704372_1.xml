<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicians may be hesitant to refer older patients with unexplained cytopenias and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> for a bone marrow biopsy (BM), and consequently undiagnosed patients may be deprived access to effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we described factors which were independently predictive of a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at time of bone marrow: age â‰¥65, mean cell volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), and suggested a scoring system to calculate the post-test probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we validate this scoring system in a cohort of 313 individuals who underwent bone marrow examinations for the investigation of unexplained cytopenias and or <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> over a 3 year period at our institution (2006-2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 9% had suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The post-test likelihood of a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increased from 12% when none of the four identified factors were present to 48% when 3 or more factors were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This scoring system can be used to guide the diagnostic testing of patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias or <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
