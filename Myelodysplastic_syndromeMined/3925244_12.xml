<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently proposed that physiological and pharmacological agents which enhance differentiation and maturation in vitro act by two fundamentally different routes: (1) by hastening the progression through various differentiation/maturation steps; (2) by slowing proliferation (usually by inhibition of DNA synthesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to test this thesis we looked for synergistic effects on differentiation using pairs of agents from the two groups in cultures of cells from myelodysplastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results with three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples show that combinations of differentiation inducing agents (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7438">N-methylformamide</z:chebi>) with DNA synthesis inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and aphidicolin) produce a differentiation inducing effect equivalent to that of 10-100, or even 1000 fold higher concentrations of single agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myelotoxic effects in vitro were not synergistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of these synergistic combinations should greatly enhance the usefulness of differentiation inducers in the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
