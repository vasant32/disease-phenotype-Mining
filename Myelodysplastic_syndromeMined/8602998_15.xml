<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical, cytological and cytogenetic features of 49 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three children had received prior cytotoxic treatment (group 1); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these had cytogenetic abnormalities and died shortly after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>22 children had constitutional anomalies (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 24 MDS were considered as 'primary' (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoplastic marrow</z:e> was found in nine cases, and only 53% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> fitted the adult FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> occurred in 11 cases, development of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in three cases, and spontaneous remission in one case each of RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences were observed between groups 2 and 3 in terms of mean age at diagnosis (11.1 months v 5 years), rate of cytogenetic anomalies (15% v 38%) and rate of progression towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (13% v 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the fur girls studied exhibited a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation, which suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be only the haematological expression of an embryological defect with different target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in childhood can exhibit particular features such as congenital anomalies associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo>, polyclonality, and spontaneous remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It emphasizes that the FAB classification is not adequate for children and addresses the question of whether these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are always malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
