<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the next future, classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> will include a cartography of different molecular markers at diagnosis that could help in treatment decision making, as it is increasingly the case in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
