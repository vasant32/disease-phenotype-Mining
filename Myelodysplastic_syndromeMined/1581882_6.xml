<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aneuploid cells (p less than 0.001) and of structural aberrations (p less than 0.005) was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but showed no relationship with FAB type or with the presence of clonal karyotype abnormalities in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exchange configurations were only observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (27.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that there may be an association between high peripheral blood aberration levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
