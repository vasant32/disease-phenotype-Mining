<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is becoming more apparent that progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> is the result of defects in progenitor cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MPC of bone marrow was analyzed in mice using a cell culture assay for measuring the relative frequency of proliferative myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to the cytokines SCF, IL-3, and GM-CSF was determined by this assay for the leukemic mouse strain BXH-2 and ten other inbred mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found to exist among ten inbred mouse strains in the nature of their MPC in bone marrow, indicating the presence of genetic polymorphisms responsible for the divergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SWR/J and FVB/J strains show consistently low frequencies of myeloid progenitors, while the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J and SJL/J inbred strains show consistently high frequencies of myeloid progenitors within the bone marrow compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in silico linkage disequilibrium analysis was conducted to identify possible chromosomal regions responsible for the phenotypic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the importance of this cell compartment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progression and the soon to be released genomic sequence of 15 mouse strains, these differences may provide a valuable tool for research into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
