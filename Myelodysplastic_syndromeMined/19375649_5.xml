<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Tyrosine kinases are involved in cytokine signaling and are frequently aberrantly activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lnk, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, plays critical nonredundant roles in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By binding to phosphorylated tyrosine kinases, Lnk inhibits major cytokine receptor signaling, including c-KIT; erythropoietin receptor-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2); and MPL-JAK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated Lnk expression and possible function in transformed hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coimmunoprecipitations were performed to identify binding between Lnk and mutant tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation assays were done to examine the affect of Lnk overexpression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516170" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer cell growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to determine Lnk expression in patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that, in parallel to binding <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> JAK2 and c-KIT, Lnk associates with and is phosphorylated by mutant alleles of JAK2 and c-KIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Lnk does not bind to and is not phosphorylated by BCR-ABL fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of Lnk strongly attenuates growth of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, while others as well as most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines are either moderately inhibited or completely insensitive to Lnk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Lnk-mediated growth inhibition is associated with differential downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, analysis of Lnk in a large panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patient samples revealed high levels of Lnk in nearly half of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although how leukemic cells overcome the antiproliferative effects of Lnk is not yet clear, our data highlight the multifaceted role negative feedback mechanisms play in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
