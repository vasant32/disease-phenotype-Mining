<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PLC beta1 is a well-known example, given that it has been shown that only the enzyme located in the nucleus targets the cyclin D3/cdk4 complex, playing, in turn, a key role in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PLC beta1 gene, which is constituted of 36 small exons and large introns, maps on the short arm of human chromosome 20 (20pl2, nearby markers D20S917 and D20S177) with the specific probe (PAC clone HS881E24) spanning from exon 19 to 32 of the gene itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosome band 20pl2 has been shown to be rearranged in human diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> without a more accurate definition of the alteration, maybe because of the absence of candidate genes or specific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, non-specific alterations in chromosome 20 have been found in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The availability of a highly specific probe gave an opportunity to perform in patients affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, painting and FISH analysis aimed to check the PLC beta1 gene, given that this signaling molecule is a key player in the control of some checkpoints of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progression through the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis disclosed in a small group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype the monoallelic deletion of the PLC beta1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PLC beta4, another gene coding for a signaling molecule, located on 20pl2.3 at a distance as far as less than 1 Mb from PLC beta1, is unaffected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with the deletion of PLC beta1 gene, hinting at an interstitial deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, bearing the deletion, rapidly evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, whilst the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, showing non-deletion of PLC beta1 gene, are still alive at least 24 months after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immunocytochemical analysis using an anti PLC beta1 monoclonal antibody showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients who were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at FISH analysis also had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining of the nucleus, which is a preferential site for PLC beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the monoallelic deletion gave rise to a dramatic decrease of the nuclear staining suggesting a decreased expression of the nuclear PLC beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reported data strengthen the contention of a key role played by PLC beta1 in the nucleus, suggest a possible involvement of PLC beta1 in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and pave the way for a larger investigation aimed at identifying a possible high risk group among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
