<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of hematopoietic disorders diagnosed using morphologic and clinical findings supported by cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because abnormalities may be subtle, diagnosis using these approaches can be challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric (FCM) approaches have been described; however the value of bone marrow immunophenotyping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains unclear due to the variability in detected abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to refine the FCM approach by using peripheral blood (PB) to create a clinically useful tool for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PB from 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry using an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patterns of neutrophil antigen expression were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 16) to establish light scatter and/or immunophenotypic abnormalities that correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A scoring algorithm was developed and validated prospectively on a blinded patient set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PB neutrophils from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had lower side scatter and higher expression of CD66 and CD11a than did controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> PB neutrophils demonstrated abnormal CD116 and CD10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because none of these abnormalities proved consistently diagnostic, we sought to increase the power of the assay by devising a scoring system to allow the association of multiple abnormalities and account for phenotypic variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PB <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> score differentiated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from controls (P &lt; 0.0001) in the test set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a prospective validation, the PB <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> score successfully identified patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (sensitivity 73%, specificity 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FCM analysis of side scatter and only four additional immunophenotypic parameters of PB neutrophils using the PB <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> score proved more sensitive than standard laboratory approaches and may provide an additional, more reliable diagnostic tool in the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
