<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to provide an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-oral regimen suitable for palliative treatment, we assessed the antileukemic efficacy of combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 20 mg/m(2) (days 1, 3, and 5) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (EI) in increasing doses (75-125 mg/m(2)) on days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were included (median age 69 years, range: 56-77) with prognostically unfavorable characteristics (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, relapse, or unfavorable karyotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No complete remission and five partial remissions were observed whereas four patients had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were two patients who succumbed to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 100 days (range: 8-493 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonhematological toxicities were acceptable with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> being the predominant side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicity with grade III/IV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study EI did not show convincing antileukemic efficacy and was unable to induce clinically useful complete remissions, with a substantial risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the situation of elderly patients with standard-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in which similar oral treatment has shown promising activity, EI cannot be recommended for elderly patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
