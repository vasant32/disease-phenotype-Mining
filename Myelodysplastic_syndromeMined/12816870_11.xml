<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unbalanced translocation der(1;7)(q10; p10) is a nonrandom chromosomal aberration commonly observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We molecularly analyzed the breakpoints of der(1;7)(q10;p10) by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using centromeric satellite DNAs mapped to chromosomes 1 and 7 as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the signal intensities of 2 centromere alphoid probes, D1Z7 on chromosome 1 and D7Z1 on chromosome 7, were almost invariably reduced on the derivative chromosome compared with those on their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this translocation results from the recombination between the 2 alphoids, which was further confirmed by fiber FISH experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the relative reduction in the intensities of D1Z7 and D7Z1 signals on the derivative chromosomes was highly variable among patients, it was estimated that the breakpoints in these patients were randomly distributed over several megabase pairs within each alphoid cluster except for its extreme end to the short arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a novel insight into the structural basis for generation of this translocation as well as its leukemogenic roles </plain></SENT>
