<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to analyze DICER1 and DROSHA gene and protein expression in mesenchymal stromal cells (the osteoblastic progenitors) obtained from bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, in addition to microRNA expression profile and other target genes such as SBDS, a DICER1-related gene that promotes bone marrow dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> when repressed in a murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Mesenchymal stromal cells from 33 bone marrow samples were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DICER, DROSHA and SBDS gene expression levels were assessed by real-time PCR and protein expression by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA expresion profile was analyzed by commercial low-density arrays and some of these results were confirmed by individual real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mesenchymal stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients showed lower DICER1 (0.65±0.08 vs. 1.91±0.57; P=0.011) and DROSHA (0.62±0.06 vs. 1.38±0.29; P=0.009) gene expression levels, two relevant endonucleases associated to microRNA biogenesis, in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed at protein levels by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, no differences were observed between paired mononuclear cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, mesenchymal stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients showed significant lower SBDS (0.63±0.06 vs. 1.15±0.28; P=0.021) gene expression levels than mesenchymal stromal cells from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mesenchymal stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients showed an underlying microRNA repression compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR approach confirmed that mir-155, miR-181a and miR-222 were down-expressed in mesenchymal stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions This is the first description of an impaired microRNA biogenesis in human mesenchymal stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, where DICER1 and DROSHA gene and protein downregulation correlated to a gene and microRNA abnormal expression profile, validating the animal model results previously described </plain></SENT>
