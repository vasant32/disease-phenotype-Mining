<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess whether this is due to uncertainty in interpretation of the observed banding pattern or whether it reflects true genomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, we decided to analyze the breakpoint positions using fluorescence in situ (FISH) techniques in eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and rearrangements of chromosomes 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three patients, colocalization of the NPM1 and MLF1 spanning BACs was demonstrated and NPM1/MLF1 fusion shown by PCR in one while in the remaining cases breakpoints were located outside the NPM1 and MLF1 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, loss of a copy of the NPM1 gene was found in three of these latter patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This findings suggest that haploinsufficiency of NPM1 may play a role in subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
