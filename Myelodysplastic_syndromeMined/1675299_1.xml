<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients with various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied for the loss of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) heterozygosity on chromosome 5q as inferential support for the presence of a growth regulatory locus in this area of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional chromosomal analysis was performed in addition to RFLP studies of constitutive and granulocyte DNA using five polymorphisms from chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss in granulocyte DNA was identified in only one patient in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 had already been defined cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DNA sequence loss from chromosome 5q other than that observed cytogenetically is a rare event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the potential involvement of a growth regulatory gene(s), from this area of the genome, in the leukemogenic process most likely involves a more subtle genetic change </plain></SENT>
