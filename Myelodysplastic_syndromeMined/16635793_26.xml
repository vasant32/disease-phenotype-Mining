<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), we added Thymoglobulin (THY) to dose-adjusted oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (targeted BUCY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The starting dose of THY was 4.5 mg/kg given over days -3, -2, and -1, escalated in steps of 1.5 mg/kg in cohorts of 15 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Escalation was dependent on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD incidence and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and other myeloid disorders underwent transplantation with peripheral blood progenitor cells from related (n=30) or unrelated (n=26) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients achieved engraftment, and 56% survived in remission beyond 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 50%, and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest THY dose was 6.0 mg/kg, a dose at which 1 patient experienced Epstein-Barr virus reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients did not receive the prescribed THY dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were comparable for related and unrelated transplants and for patients given 4.5 or 6.0 mg/kg THY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients (14 with related and 13 with unrelated donors) who underwent transplantation concurrently with targeted BUCY without THY, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, THY 4.5 to 6.0 mg/kg seemed beneficial for GVHD prevention in BUCY-conditioned patients who underwent transplantation with peripheral blood progenitor cells, although relapse-free survival did not differ significantly from that in comparable historical controls not given THY </plain></SENT>
