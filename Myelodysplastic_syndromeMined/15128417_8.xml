<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To further characterise the genetic background of the two closely related B-lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL), and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) we have identified characteristic copy number imbalances by comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, areas of special interest were fine mapped, and relevant probes constructed for use in interphase-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, using the CGH data from 52 HCL and 61 SMZL patients, we identified the characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances for both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were a gain of 5q13-31 (19%) and loss of 7q22-q35 (6%) for HCL, and gain of 3q25 (28%), loss of 7q31 (16%), and gain of 12q15 (16%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A partial loss of 7q unusual for low-malignant B-cell diseases was found to be common to the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This loss was therefore fine mapped with BAC/PAC clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping revealed that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> the minimal lost region covers 11.4 Mb spanning from 7q31.33 to 7q33 located between sequence tagged site (STS)-markers SHGC-3275 and D7S725 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This area was distinct from the commonly deleted 7q region of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A FISH probe specific for the 7q region was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using this probe in an interphase-FISH investigation we showed the minimal lost 7q-region of HCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> to be one and the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one HCL case, this investigation furthermore showed the extent of the deleted region to be below the detection limit of CGH, whereas interphase-FISH screening of 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) cases showed no deletion of the 7q area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances in HCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> and fine mapped the minimal extent of a commonly lost 7q area of special interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that this region may contain (a) gene(s) important for the pathology of HCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
