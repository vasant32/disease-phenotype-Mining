<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present previously unpublished data from two large phase III trials describing common adverse events (AEs) associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and methods to manage them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) 9221 study, patients with any French-American-British (FAB) subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> or best supportive care (BSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 56 d, patients randomized to BSC with disease progression could cross over to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the AZA-001 study, patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (FAB-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocitic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and IPSS int-2 or high) were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> or to conventional care regimens (CCR), which included low-dose ara-C, BSC, or intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> dose was 75 mg/m(2)/d SC for 7 d every 28 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AEs were graded per National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (AZA-001) or CALGB Expanded CTC (CALGB 9221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In safety-evaluable patients in AZA-001 (N = 175) or CALGB 9221 (N = 150), the most common AEs with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> included hematologic (eg, cytopenias) and non-hematologic administration-related events (eg, injection-site reactions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most AEs were transient and resolved during ongoing therapy (&gt; 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematologic AEs, most frequently observed during early treatment cycles, decreased during subsequent cycles and were usually managed with dosing delays (23-29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal symptoms were primarily managed with anti-emetics and <z:chebi fb="35" ids="50503">laxatives</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hematologic and non-hematologic AEs with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> decreased in frequency as treatment continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, duration and management of AEs can facilitate treatment, permitting patients to continue therapy for maximum benefit </plain></SENT>
