<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the bone marrow was hypercellular and 77% of the cells were blasts, mainly lymphoblast-like cells and cytogenetic study demonstrated 45, XY, -7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytochemically most of those blasts were negative for peroxidase, sudan black B, alpha-NB esterase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunological phenotype was J5 (CD10)+, I2 (HLA-DR)+, SmIg-, CyIgmu-, Leu1 (CD5)-, OKT11 (CD2)-, MY7 (CD13)-, suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight months later, the bone marrow cells were occupied with large sized blasts which were almost positive for peroxidase stain and the cells showed coexpression of Mo1 (CD11b)+, MY4 (CD14)+, MY7+, MY9 (CD33)+, MCS2 (CD13)+, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36899">I2+</z:chebi>, J5-, B4 (CD19)-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37238">Mo2</z:chebi> (CDw14)-, at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He died 2 years and 6 months after his initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An autopsy was performed which revealed generalized infiltration of leukemic cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in childhood, and is terminated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this case, bone marrow blasts demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cytogenetically, and this case was considered as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of bilineal type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And this case proved that a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 can also be terminated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with both lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes </plain></SENT>
