<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her karyotype was defined as 47, XX, +8[20] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though she was treated successfully with multi-drug chemotherapy, she relapsed after 2 years of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow transplantation from HLA matched her brother was performed to induce hematological remission which persisted for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She again relapsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and an abnormal complex karyotype was newly detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She eventually died without further chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed FISH on the patient's stained bone marrow smears using DNA probes for chromosome 8 and Y to analyze the clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the most of blasts and bone marrow cells except lymphoid cells were of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, while in the 1st remission, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone was slightly detected only in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1st and 2nd relapse, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone was detected again in most of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this case, it was considered that underlying stem cell disorder with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 during the entire disease course contributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
