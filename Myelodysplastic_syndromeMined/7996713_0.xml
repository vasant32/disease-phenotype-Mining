<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell population in the phases of G1, S and G2 + M were well analyzed, when we used 3 x 10(6) cells lysed with 0.1% <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline, staining with 30 micrograms/ml of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) within 30 min after staining with PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have further developed cell cycle analysis for cells bearing lineage specific antigens recognized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated monoclonal antibodies using two color analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When we fixed cells with 50% ice-cold <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> after staining cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated antibodies, positive population ratio in these cells have been unchanged before and after fixing for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD10, CD19, CD14, CD33, and HLA-DR, but CD7 positive cells were markedly decreased after fixing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this method, CD41 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells have 3.4% in S phase and 6.8% in G2 + M phase, while CD41 negative cells have 1.8% in S phase and 2.0% in G2 + M phase in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: M7, resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells were rich in S phase and G2 + M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similar results were obtained in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>:M2 using CD33 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the clinical course, the changes of the blast numbers were well-correlated with changes of S-phase proportion in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>:M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> in our hospital tested here, only 2 cases with 4.3% of total patients showed to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in malignant cells </plain></SENT>
