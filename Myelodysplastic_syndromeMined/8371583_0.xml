<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The density distribution patterns of erythrocytes from the patients prior to treatment were in accordance with their inability to produce compensating levels of circulating RBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The complete response of one patient to rhEPO and partial responses of two other patients were accompanied by shifts to larger proportions of low density (young) RBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro phagocytosis of density-fractionated RBC from the complete responder was similar to those of age-matched non-anemic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated erythrophagocytosis prior to rhEPO administration was observed for the partial responders and further increased during treatment in one, suggesting the stimulation of abnormal progenitors producing highly defective erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between levels of erythrophagocytosis and RBC membrane-bound immunoglobulins in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that density distribution analysis of circulating RBC coupled with in vitro erythrophagocytosis may provide useful predictive tools for selecting potential responders to rhEPO administration among anemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
