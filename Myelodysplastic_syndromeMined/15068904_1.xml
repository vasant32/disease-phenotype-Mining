<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Continuous human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL) cell lines represent a rich resource of abundant, accessible and manipulable living cells contributing significantly to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, classical and molecular cytogenetics have benefitted enormously from the availability of LL cell lines with specific chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such aberrations may be the portal to the discovery of novel oncogene rearrangements for which positive cell lines provide a resource for both discovery and functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The new continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line MUTZ-11 was established in 1994 from the peripheral blood of a 60-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) M4 (following 2 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA fingerprinting confirmed the authenticity and derivation of the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoprofile as determined by flow cytometry was as follows: positive for myelocytic markers (CD13, CD15, CD33, CD65 and CD68), negative for T-cell (except for CD4 and CD7), B-cell and erythroid-megakaryocytic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell line is constitutively cytokine-dependent and growth depends on externally added cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to cytokine receptor expression, the cell line was found to be positive for GM-CSFRalpha (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, CD116), Kit (CD117) and IL-3Ralpha (interleukin-3 receptor, CD123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytokine response profiles as determined by [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assay were: 2-to-12 fold growth stimulation of MUTZ-11 by GM-CSF, IFN-alpha (interferon), IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-3 and SCF (stem cell factor); growth inhibition by TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor), TNF-alpha (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor) and TNF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis showed the following consensus karyotype: 46, XX, der(16)t(16;17)(p13.3;q23)x2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous molecular biological analysis documented that MUTZ-11 cells carry both an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and an MLL partial tandem duplication (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The scientific significance of MUTZ-11 lies (i). in the absolute cytokine-dependency and the proliferative response to various cytokines, (ii). in the unique cytogenetic (disomic t(16;17)) and (iii). molecular biological alterations (FLT3 ITD + MLL <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, the new cytokine-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-derived cell line MUTZ-11 displays unique novel features and emphasizes the need for comprehensive analysis of new LL cell lines which may lead to the discovery of important pathogenetic alterations </plain></SENT>
