<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the differences between HIV-related MDF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the morphological changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis and the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> treatment were studied in 158 HIV+ patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophilia</z:e> and the results were compared with those of 61 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (31 with RA, 10 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood and bone marrow examination revealed MDF in 44 HIV-infected haemophilic patients (27.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time from seroconversion was 12.5 years and the mean time under <z:chebi fb="39" ids="10110">AZT</z:chebi> therapy was 44.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of these patients (43.1%) had Hb levels &lt; 10 g dL(-1), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were observed in 29.5% and 25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Every patient of this study with Hb &lt; 10 g dL(-1) received erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant morphological alterations between HIV-related MDF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: hypocellularity, plasmatocytosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> were more pronounced in HIV haemophiliacs with MDF, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and granulocytes was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No HIV haemophilic patient with MDF had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow nor did any develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> during the period of this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete erythroid response was achieved with Epo administration in 84.2% of HIV+ haemophilic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> compared to 19.7% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that bone marrow changes in long-term HIV patients have different characteristics from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and constitute the entity for which the name HIV-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> has been proposed in the literature </plain></SENT>
