<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, existing cytogenetics grouping schemes are based on patients treated with supportive care, and may not be optimal for patients undergoing allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We proposed earlier an SCT-specific cytogenetics grouping scheme for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, based on an analysis of patients transplanted at the Dana-Farber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under this scheme, abnormalities of chromosome 7 and complex karyotype are considered adverse risk, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others are considered standard risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we validated this scheme on an independent multicenter cohort of 546 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse cytogenetics was the strongest prognostic factor for outcome in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4-year relapse-free survival and OS were 42 and 46%, respectively, in the standard-risk group, vs 21 and 23% in the adverse group (P&lt;0.0001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This grouping scheme retained its prognostic significance irrespective of patient age, disease type, earlier leukemogenic therapy and conditioning intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy-related disease was not associated with increased mortality in this cohort, after taking cytogenetics into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that this SCT-specific cytogenetics grouping scheme be used for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who are considering or undergoing SCT </plain></SENT>
