<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study of 82 MDS patients, we identified 10 (12%) with IMC (group A) and compared them to the remaining 72 cases (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A consisted of 5 patients with biopsy-verified skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and 1 case each with temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pmr">polymyalgia rheumatica</z:e>, necrotising <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival times, sex ratio and distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients in group A were younger than those in group B (median 66 vs. 76 years, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (40%) in group A had a history of previous genotoxic therapy for malignant disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow karyotype was evaluated in 62 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found more frequently in Group A than in group B (8/9 vs. 26/53, p = 0.03), and complex karyotypes, i.e., three or more aberrations, were also observed to be more common in group A (3/9 vs. 8/53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that IMC preferentially develop in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, in younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, and in patients with cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
