<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 195 MDS patients wa s performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in whom a karyotype was obtained and with an adequate follow-up were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (WBC &gt; 12x10(9)/l) were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 3.1 years, and median survival stratified by IPSS was 3.4, 4.1 and 0.5 years for the INT-1, INT-2 and high risk group and not yet reached for the low risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival by IPSS subcategorization were 6.88, 5.29, 5.30 and 2.12 years for the low, INT-1, INT-2, and high risk groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics were significant in predicting the overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IPSS score stratified patients into risk categories for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of development into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 8, 8, 33 and 54% for the low, INT-1, INT-2 and high risk groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IPSS score can be useful in predicting survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
