<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) protein is essential for proper lung and liver function and granulocytic and adipose tissue differentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that abnormalties in C/EBPalpha function contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in a variety of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this, genomic DNA from 408 patient samples and 5 cell lines representing 11 different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> was screened for mutations in the C/EBPalpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two silent polymorphisms termed P1 and P2 were present at frequencies of 13.5% and 2.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 mutations detected in 10 patients, silent changes were identified in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) subtype M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 9 remaining mutations were detected in 1 of 92 (1.1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) samples and 6 of 78 (7.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some mutations truncated the predicted protein with loss of the DNA-binding (basic region) and dimerization (leucine zipper [ZIP]) domains by either deletions or nonsense codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, inframe deletions or insertions in the fork region located between the leucine zipper and basic region, or within the leucine zipper, disrupted the alpha-helical phase of the bZIP domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inframe deletion and insertion mutations abrogated the transcriptional activation function of C/EBPalpha on the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These mutants localized properly to the nucleus, but were unable to bind to the C/EBP site in the promoter and did not possess dominant-negative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M2 patient were biallelic, indicating a loss of C/EBPalpha function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mutation of C/EBPalpha is involved in specific subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but may occur rarely in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0935681" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nonhematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
