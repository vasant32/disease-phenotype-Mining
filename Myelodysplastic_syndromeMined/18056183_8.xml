<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the influence of genetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific factors on Pgp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eight hundred and seventeen samples were studied prospectively for Pgp protein expression and function and G1199A, G2677T, and C3435T polymorphisms in the encoding gene ABCB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, low WBC count, high bcl-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and adverse cytogenetics <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlated strongly with high Pgp (MRK16) protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, ABCB1 3435TT homozygosity was negatively correlated with Pgp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pgp protein is only expressed in 41% of samples such that the negative effect of the polymorphism was not seen at baseline Pgp levels but was marked in the upper 41% of samples (MRK16 Deltamean fluorescence intensity of 75th centile sample = 9 units for TT variant samples and 26 units for CC/CT; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no association was found between genetic factors and Pgp function using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphism 3435TT (which results in unstable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) has a significant effect on Pgp expression, but this is only seen in approximately 40% of cases in which <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein are detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific factors, such as low WBC count and poor risk cytogenetics, have a much greater effect than genetic polymorphisms on Pgp expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts </plain></SENT>
