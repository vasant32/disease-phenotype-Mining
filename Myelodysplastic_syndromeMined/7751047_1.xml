<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of abnormal karyotypes was higher, detected in 88 per cent of the patients and the most frequent abnormality was a terminal deletion of chromosome 7 (45% of the patients with abnormal karyotypes) followed by an i (17q) (18%), +21(14%), -5/5q (9%), del (11) (q22) (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis after therapy/after leukaemic transformation indicated either stable clones (2 patients) or emergence of new clones such as inv(5) (q32q36), del (17) (p13), +20, +22 (1 patient each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is to be noted that of the 8 patients with leukaemic transformation, 5 had del (7q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The leukaemic transformation (32% of the patients) was not related to the percentage of abnormal karyotypes not to the percentage of blasts at the time of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome instability was shown by 10 (45%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations with involvement of chromosome 7 may be the result of underlying disease </plain></SENT>
