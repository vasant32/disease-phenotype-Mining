<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A pluripotent progenitor cell was demonstrated to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or with numerical chromosome aberrations, but the pattern of lineage involvement by the 5q31 deletion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed this study in order to define the distribution pattern of the 5q- anomaly better in the non-lymphoid cell compartment DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) smears from 8 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> were studied by a modification of the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique that allowed direct visualization of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A commercial LSI EGR1 probe (Vysis Inc.) for the 5q31 band was used simultaneously in dual-color experiments with a chromosome-5-centromeric probe (Vysis Inc.) on BM smears from 8 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As additional internal controls a chromosome-7-centromeric probe and a 7q31 probe were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To establish the sensitivity limit of this approach 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM smears were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 patients had the 5q- chromosome as the sole anomaly in 45% to 75% of the interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For each patient 20-40 erythroblasts were analyzed: they were mostly proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients a clone carrying the 5q31 deletion was detected (35-50% of the cells, median 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 20-50 granulocyte precursors were scored; the 5q31 deletion was found in 40%-50% (median 45%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of neutrophils carrying the 5q deletion was consistently lower than the corresponding value in promyelocytes (28.7% vs 45.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 20-25 megakaryocytes analyzable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the overall incidence of 5q31 deletion was 52-68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Equal proportions of large multilobular megakaryocytes and hypolobular megakaryocytes characteristic of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> were scored: the latter cells showed the 5q31 deletion more frequently than the former cells (93.6% vs 19.3% of the cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 66% to 100% of the cases (median 83%) a few cells with uncondensed nuclear chromatin pattern, and two or three prominent nucleoli with cytoplasmatic hypogranulation were seen in each sample carrying the 5q31 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We arrived at the following conclusions: i) the transformation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> involves an early progenitor cell retaining the ability to proceed along multiple differentiation pathways; ii) there is a preferential distribution of the 5q31 deletion within immature cells and morphologically abnormal megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
