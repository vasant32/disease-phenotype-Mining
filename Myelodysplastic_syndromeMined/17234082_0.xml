<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio in our series was 2:4, The median age <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis delay varied from 8 months to 4 years, with a median time of 18 months </plain></SENT>
