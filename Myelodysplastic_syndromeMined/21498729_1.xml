<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) complements CC since it is able to evaluate large numbers of interphase and metaphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The question has been raised as to whether interphase FISH in addition to CC is able to imprive the level of detection of del(5q) and del(20q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study performed interphase FISH with 5q and 20q probes in a series of 158 MDS patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No hidden del(5q) or del(20q) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature identified 20 patients (1.96%) of 1018 patients (including the current series) and 3 (0.91%) of 331 patients to have a del(5q) or del(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, interphase FISH adds little, if any, improvement to the probability of detecting these deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, interphase FISH is recommended in patients with no cell growth or when fewer than 20 metaphases are available for CC analysis </plain></SENT>
