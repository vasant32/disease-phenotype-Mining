<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the in vitro effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on neutrophil anomalies in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity was determined in nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and eight <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients by a scoring method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NAP scores were decreased in six of the nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with these diseases, NAP scores increased by incubating the blood with rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in NAP scores by rhG-CSF was observed even at a concentration of 1 U/mL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but was observed only at higher concentrations (1,000 to 10,000 U/mL) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in NAP scores occurred at 12 hours' incubation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas the increase was more gradual in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This time course difference was thought to be due mainly to the difference in cell populations of circulating myeloid cells between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of NAP activity by rhG-CSF in patients with both these diseases was suppressed by the addition of inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>) production induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>) was determined in the other 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This neutrophil function was decreased in seven of the 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two patients, and increased in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with rhG-CSF caused a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> production in nine of the 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rhG-CSF enhanced this neutrophil function in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and maximal stimulation was observed at 2,000 to 4,000 U/mL of rhG-CSF and at five to ten minutes' incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present results show that rhG-CSF is able to repair at least in part the neutrophil anomalies in these patients, and our data, especially for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, suggest the clinical usefulness of rhG-CSF for this preleukemic disorder </plain></SENT>
