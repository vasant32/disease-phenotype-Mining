<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were part of the large series of 209 patients cytogenetically examined during the last ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the cytogenetic findings we have distinguished three groups: 1) sixteen patients who has a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in bone marrow cells at the beginning of the investigation and this finding remained unchanged during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of them progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) without any detectable change in the chromosomal complement of the bone marrow cells; 2) twenty-five patients who had at the beginning of the study, different pathological chromosomal clones in bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no chromosomal evolution detectable during the disease; eight of them progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; 3) thirty-six patients who had either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or pathological chromosomal findings at the first examination and in whom further clonal abnormalities had developed during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of them progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two to nine cytogenetic examinations were successfully performed with a mean of three studies per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed strictly individual development of chromosomal abnormalities during the course of the disease, with an unfavorable prognosis for the patients with complex chromosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients with del 7q had very poor prognosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two cases with the same acquired abnormalities (del 20q, +8, -22) transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> within the period of 36 months from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
