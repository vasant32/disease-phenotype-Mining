<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T1 weighted images showed a reduction in signal intensity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of reduction in signal intensity correlated with bone marrow cellularity rather than percentage blasts or French-American-British Co-operative group (FAB) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2 weighted images showed an increase in signal intensity in 10 out of 11 patients; however, reliable grading was not possible using this sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both T1 and T2 weighted images indicated a homogeneous pattern of disease within the axial skeleton in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in multiply transfused patients is a significant factor influencing signal reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that MRI may have a diagnostic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but is unlikely to be of value in staging </plain></SENT>
