<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As our patients age and live longer with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, many having had PCI, they are more likely to develop potentially life-threatening comorbid conditions, including neoplastic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the United States, for example, an estimated 41% of the population will develop some form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>.1 As such, they become subject to a multitude of interactions between their cardiac and oncologic diseases, and the therapies used to treat each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is especially the case when patients have had PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), as a careful balance between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> must be maintained, and is particularly vulnerable to the interactions described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following cases and accompanying review will highlight potential risks of very late stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with acquired prothrombotic states, following coronary intervention with implantation of both 1st and second-generation DES </plain></SENT>
