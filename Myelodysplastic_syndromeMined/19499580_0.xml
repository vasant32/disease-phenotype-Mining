<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is offered as a curative therapy for pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), it may cause severe complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have shown the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), but its safety and efficacy remains to be fully elucidated in childhood RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Eleven children diagnosed with RA and enrolled on a prospective multicenter trial conducted by the Japanese Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Study Group were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If patients showed transfusion dependent or suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, they received IST consisting of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CyA), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (mPSL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight children received IST, 2 received only supportive therapy, and one underwent HSCT without IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five (63%) of eight children who received IST showed hematological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, one patient showed the disappearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responders were significantly younger than non-responders (29 months vs. 140 months; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse events related to IST were reported in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 6 children with chromosomal abnormalities who received IST, four showed hematological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of failure-free and overall survival at 5 years was 63 +/- 17% and 90 +/- 9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IST is likely to be a safe and effective modality for childhood RA </plain></SENT>
