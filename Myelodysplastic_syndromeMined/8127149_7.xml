<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As evaluated by characteristic morphological changes and oligonucleosomal lengths DNA ladder, the levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in P39 cells induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, or A23187, were far greater than in other myeloid lines examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When 22-oxa-1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 (D3), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) were used as differentiation-inducers, varying degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were seen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, RA induced profound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> concomitant with the progressive expression of differentiation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, functions and phenotypes of P39 cells exposed to differentiation inducers suggest that the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not affected by the process of differentiation, but cells in the process of varying degrees of differentiation may die via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RA-treated P39 cells are unique in the simultaneous occurrence of profound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation </plain></SENT>
