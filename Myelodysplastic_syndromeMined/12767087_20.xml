<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from 102 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> who were treated with the HDS regimen at 14 centers associated with the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had primary refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, 59 patients had their first recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (within 1 year in 32 patients and &gt; 1 year in 27 patients), and 19 patients had multiple disease recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HDS regimen included the sequential delivery of high-dose (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">hd</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with PBPC harvesting, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, then HDT (usually <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">hd</z:e> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17295,29997">L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> mustard) with PBPC autografting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, radiotherapy was delivered to 36 patients at sites of bulky or persistent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (90%) completed the HDS program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (treatment-related mortality rate, 4.9%) and six secondary malignan cies (five patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and one patient developed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 5 years, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) projections were 64% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 54-74%) and 53% (95% CI, 43-63%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with their first recurrence had the most favorable outcome, with 5-year OS and EFS projections of 77% (95% CI, 66-88%) and 63% (95% CI, 50-76%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between patients with early first recurrence and late first recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The poorest outcome was observed in patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, with 5-year OS and EFS projections of 36% (95% CI, 16-55%) and 33% (95% CI, 14-52%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who received HDS chemotherapy after multiple recurrences had an intermediate outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that refractory disease and systemic symptoms at the time of initial presentation were associated significantly associated with poor OS and EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of HDS chemotherapy for patients with refractory and/or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> is feasible at the multicenter level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The combination of intensive debulking and HDT with PBPC autografting offers a good chance of prolonged disease free survival for patients with their first recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
