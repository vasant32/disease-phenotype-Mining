<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall complete remission rate with or without platelet recovery was 7% (2/27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activity of lenalidomide was limited to patients with noncomplex cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is effective in low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with deletion 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with any chromosome 5 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 9 with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide was given orally at doses 5 to 25 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 27 patients was 64 years (range, 39-88 years) with a median of 2 previous therapies (range, 1-6 lines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (7%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 5q deletion and +8 cytogenetic abnormality in 2 separate clones achieved complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response durations were 4 and 6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No responses were seen in patients with chromosome 5 abnormality in a complex cytogenetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (74%) developed neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> requiring hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical activity of lenalidomide as single agent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with chromosome 5 abnormalities appears to be limited to patients with noncomplex cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
