<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different processes are involved in its pathogenesis, such as (epi)genetic alterations and immunological dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> is markedly different between various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the immune system is in a proinflammatory state, whereas in high-risk disease, immunosuppressive features facilitate expansion of the dysplastic clone and can eventually lead to disease progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various cell types contribute to dysregulation of immune responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells (DCs) are important regulators of immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the role of DCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that impaired DC function can hamper adequate immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the involvement of DCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> in low- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the implications for DC-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
