<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is a preleukemic condition that transforms into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic events underlying this transformation remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant DNA methylation may play a causative role in the disease and its prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared the DNA methylation profiles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) to those in refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 20 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (9 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>), and peripheral blood samples were collected from 4 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These samples were assessed using a commercial whole genome-wide methylation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the methylation of candidate gene promoters in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microarray data revealed significant hypermethylation in 69 genes within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes were mapped to 5 different networks, and network 1 had the highest score due to its involvement in gene expression, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five genes (GSTM5, BIK, CENPH, RERG, and ANGPTL2) were associated with malignant disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among them, the methylated promoter pairs of GSTM5 (55.5% and 20%), BIK (20% and 0%), and ANGPTL2 (44.4% and 10%) were observed more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DNA methylation of GSTM5, BIK, and ANGPTL2 may induce epigenetic silencing and contribute to the increasing blasts and resulting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression; however, the functions of these genes were not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study focusing on epigenetic silencing using various detection modalities is required </plain></SENT>
