<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The category of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) of the French-American-British (FAB) classification system comprises a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients: those with any combination of 5% or more blood blast cells, more than 20% but no more than 30% marrow blast cells, or the presence of auer rods and 30% or less marrow blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the prognostic significance of auer rods in RAEBt, we classified the 208 patients with RAEBt seen between 1973 and 1992 as (1) those having RAEBt solely on the basis of auer rods (RAEBta, n = 29), (2) those meeting blood or marrow blast criteria for RAEBt and also having auer rods (RAEBtpos, n = 40) or (3) those meeting blood or marrow blast criteria for RAEBt without having auer rods (RAEBtneg, n = 139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RAEBta group had a higher survival probability than either of the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within RAEBta, those patients who, without auer rods, would be considered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> by the FAB system (n = 19) had a higher probability of survival than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> as conventionally defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with RAEBtpos were more likely to live longer than those with RAEBtneg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RAEBta, RAEBtpos and RAEBtneg groups were similar with regard to the usual haematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with auer rods were more likely to have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and less likely to have prognostically unfavourable cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When analysis was performed within cytogenetic groups, the favourable prognostic impact of auer rods was still evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the favourable prognostic significance of auer rods was discernible both among patients who did not receive intensive therapy and those who received induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complete remission rate in auer rod positive patients was 77%, compared to 27% in those without auer rods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that: (1) patients with auer rods without blood or bone marrow blast criteria for RAEBt should not be grouped with those patients with such criteria, and (2) patients with auer rods and other criteria for RAEBt have a higher complete remission rate following induction therapy of the type frequently reserved for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
