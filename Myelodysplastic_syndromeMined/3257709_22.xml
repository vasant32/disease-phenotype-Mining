<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-cell number and activity were evaluated by counts of total T-cells and T-lymphocyte subsets, and by measure of DNA synthesis in response to phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B-cells were evaluated as surface immunoglobulin- (SIg+) bearing cells and by serum immunoglobulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte activities were evaluated by responses to chemotaxis and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complement activity was measured by classic hemolytic complement assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, circulating immune complexes were detected in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were associated with a significant decrease in the absolute numbers of total T (E-rosetting and T3+) cells, T4+, and T8+ cells and a dramatic decrease of the responses to Concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An impairment of either chemotaxis or of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) test was frequently encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in the levels of IgG or IgA was also a frequent feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings reveal that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a high degree of T-cell impairment have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> associated with an excess of medullary blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the data suggest that the counts of the absolute number of cells bearing the T3 and T8 phenotypes could be of prognostic value: the higher the number, the better the patient's survival </plain></SENT>
