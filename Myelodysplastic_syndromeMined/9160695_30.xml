<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients requiring allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phenotypically matched unrelated donor graft has been made available for approximately 50% of Caucasians and less than 10% of ethnic and racial minorities in need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients have a readily available partially mismatched related donor (PMRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We summarize our experience with 72 patients who ranged from 1 to 50 years of age (median, 16 years) and who were recipients of a PMRD allo-BMT from haploidentical family members following conditioning therapy using total body irradiation (TBI) and multiagent, high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and post-BMT immunosuppression were combined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of engraftment was 0.88 at 32 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 10 patients who failed to engraft achieved engraftment after secondary transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 9 of 58 (16%) evaluable patients; extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 4 of 48 (8%) evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in 2-year survival probability between low-risk and high-risk patients (0.55 v 0.27, P = .048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors that affected outcomes in multivariate analysis were (1) a lower TBI dose and 3-antigen rejection mismatch decreased stable engraftment (P = .005 and P = .002, respectively); (2) a higher T-cell dose increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (P = .058); (3) a higher TBI dose increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (P = .016); and (4) a high-risk disease category increased treatment failure from relapse or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = .037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A PMRD transplant can be performed with acceptable rates of graft failure and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using sequential immunomodulation, the disease status at the time of transplant is the only prognostic factor significantly associated with long-term successful outcome after PMRD allo-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When allogeneic rather than autologous BMT is indicated, progression in disease status before transplant can be avoided using a PMRD with equal inclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic or racial groups </plain></SENT>
