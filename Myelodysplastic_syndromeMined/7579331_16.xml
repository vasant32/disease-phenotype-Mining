<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment, but remains limited to a small subgroup of younger patients with HLA-compatible donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As autologous stem cell transplantation is currently being explored as an alternative treatment strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, more information needs to be acquired regarding the clonal nature of the progenitor cells in these autografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have analyzed the clonal patterns of highly purified hematopoietic progenitors and their mature daughter cells in mobilized peripheral blood collections produced from five female patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in complete hematologic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome activation patterns of flow-sorted immature (CD34 + 38low, CD34 + 33low) and committed (CD34 + 38high, CD34 + 33high) progenitors were studied with the polymerase chain reaction-based HUMARA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients, a polyclonal remission was shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stem cell subpopulations and their mature daughter cells whereas one patient was found to remain skewed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fractions, except T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides strong evidence that polyclonal immature hematopoietic progenitors can be mobilized and harvested in patients high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after treatment with high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
