<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is regarded as a stem cell disorder, the present studies were undertaken to examine the relative susceptibility and propensity of early progenitor CD34+ cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as compared to more maturing/matured CD34- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five serial studies were performed on 4 independent groups of 36 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, in 2 separate groups of 16 and 8 patients each, measurement of the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD34+ and CD34- fractions of the BM aspirate mononuclear cells was carried out using independent biparametric flow cytometry methods, CD34 labeling/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) (n = 16), and CD34 labeling/reduced uptake of nucleic acid staining dye LDS751 (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in the median degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD34+ vs. CD34- cells was not statistically significant by either technique (P = 0.583 and P = 0.674 for TUNEL and LDS751, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the next group of 4 MDS patients, a double-labeling was performed on plastic embedded marrow biopsy sections, to detect CD34 antigen with specific monoclonal antibody and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by in situ end labeling (ISEL) of fragmented DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite high overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (56.2% +/- 18.4%), only an occasional CD34+ cell was found to be simultaneously labeled with ISEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the last group of 8 MDS patients, CD34+ cells were separated from CD34- cells on affinity column and cultured in serum containing medium for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 0- and 4-hour time points, ISEL was carried out to label apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a fluorometric assay was employed to estimate the activity of a proapoptotic enzyme, Caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the net increase in % ISEL labeled cells (apoptotic index or AI) and Caspase-3 activity were significantly lower in CD34+ cells as compared to CD34- cells (AI, 0.87% +/- 0.5% vs. 3.97% +/- 1.4%, n = 6, P = 0.028 and Caspase-3 Units/mg protein, 46.9 +/- 25.0 vs. 71.7 +/- 23.03, n = 5, P = 0.042, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that when estimated in a total population of mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells and CD34- cells show comparable degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, once separated the CD34+ fraction demonstrates lower propensity to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, thereby suggesting the CD34- fraction as being a possible source for proapoptotic signaling </plain></SENT>
