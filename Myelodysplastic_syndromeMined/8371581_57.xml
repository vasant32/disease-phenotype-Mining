<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied karyotype at diagnosis in 408 cases of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (after excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes were classified in 10 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; isolated del 5q; del 5q and other rearrangements; isolated +8; isolated -7 or del 7q; del 20q; isolated -Y; miscellaneous single rearrangements; -7 or del 7q and other rearrangements; miscellaneous complex rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes were considered complex when at least three chromosomes were rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotypes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with del 5q and other rearrangements, -7 or del 7q and other rearrangements, and miscellaneous complex rearrangements (i.e. three of the 10 groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial survival of the 408 patients was 28 months, and 90 patients (22%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For survival, bone marrow (BM) blasts, circulating blasts, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count, platelet count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, age, sex, FAB classification, and Bournemouth and Sanz's scores had strong prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics also had strong prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unfavorable cytogenetic group (patients with complex karyotypes) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, although patients with isolated del 20q and del 5q had a somewhat better prognosis than other patients with non-complex cytogenetic findings, they could not be statistically individualized as a favorable group, possibly owing to their relatively limited number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By multivariate regression analysis, a three-variable new scoring system could be designed based on karyotype (1 point for complex karyotype; 0 for other groups), platelets (0 for &gt; 75 x 10(9)/l; 1 for &lt; 75 x 10(9)/l), and BM blasts (0 for &lt; 5%, 1 for 5-10%, 2 for &gt; 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total score (addition of points for the three variables) was able to separate patients in three groups with low (score 0) intermediate (score 1 or 2), and high risk (score 3 or 4) which included 34%, 47%, and 19% of the patients, and had a median survival of 55, 24, and 6 months, respectively (chi 2 = 110, p &lt; 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This new score (Lille score) was able to subdivide risk groups according to Bournemouth and Sanz's scores into further subgroups of different prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, BM blasts, circulating blasts, WBC count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, FAB type, and karyotype had prognostic value by univariate analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
