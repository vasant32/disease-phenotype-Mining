<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the prognostic implications of CA in 1000 MM patients receiving melphalan-based tandem autotransplants (median follow-up, 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Negative consequences for both overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in the presence of any CA were confirmed, especially when detected within 3 months of HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the context of standard prognostic factors (SPF), 'MM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>' (MM karyotype that contains, in addition, CA typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) imparted a poor OS and EFS, after adjusting for any CA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individual CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-year mortality was also high, especially for the MM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroup with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 within a MM signature karyotype (87%vs 34% in its absence, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient remained event free 5 years post transplant in the presence of these baseline high-risk CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, certain <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> (e.g. chromosomes 7 and 9) and del 20 had favourable clinical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher risk that is associated with CA compared with SPF justifies routine cytogenetic studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with MM at diagnosis and whenever additional treatment decisions are considered, such as in planning HDT either for initial response consolidation, at the time of primary unresponsiveness to induction therapy, or at relapse </plain></SENT>
