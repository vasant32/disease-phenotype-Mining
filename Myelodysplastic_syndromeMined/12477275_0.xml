<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e> syndrome) is a disorder that presents in the neonatal period, but predisposes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes a 4-y-old female with a history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo>, who developed a clonal abnormality associated with the translocation (7;21;8) (q32;q22;q22) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had circulating peripheral blasts and bone marrow blast counts as high as 64% when she received recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her marrow blasts decreased to 4-20% when rG-CSF was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on bone marrow cell populations sorted by flow cytometry to determine which cell populations had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The translocation was found in mature neutrophils and blasts, but not in monocytes, lymphocytes or stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the translocation occurred in a neutrophil progenitor, past the point in ontogeny where monocytes and neutrophils separate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The techniques described may be useful in understanding lineage relationships and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in other clonal abnormalities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
