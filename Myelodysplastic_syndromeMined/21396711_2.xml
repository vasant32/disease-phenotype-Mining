<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared characteristics of 62 MDS patients with isolated del 20q, 36 patients with del 20q and other cytogenetic abnormalities, and 1335 MDS patients without del20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del 20q and patients without del 20q were lower platelet count (mean 144 vs. 196 G/l, p=0.005), lower marrow blast count (mean 3.9% vs. 5.6%, p=0.0008), and higher reticulocyte count (mean 72.5 vs. 51.7 G/l, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten (16%) patients with isolated del 20q had Hb&gt;12 g/dl and platelets &lt;100 G/l, compared to 7.3% of patients without del 20q (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Review of marrow slides of those 10 patients showed that could be readily identified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prior to cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of patients with isolated del 20q progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compared to 11% with one and 24% with several additional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 54 months in patients with isolated del 20q, not reached and 12 months for del 20q with one and several additional abnormalities, respectively (p=0.035) confirming the favorable prognosis of del 20q without complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
