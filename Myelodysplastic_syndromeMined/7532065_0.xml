<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By serially measuring serum levels of alpha-1 microglobulin and beta-2 microglobulin following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we tried to define their relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as complications of the transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study involved a total of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received BMT in this department; one patient received re-transplantation, thus bringing the total number of transplants to 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients received BMT from HLA-identical siblings while two others received BMT from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alpha-1 microglobulin was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before BMT; among various complications such as nephrotoxicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> which took place after transplantation, a raised alpha-1 microglobulin level was found only in nephrotoxicity; however, the increase was not significant compared with the pre-transplantation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pre-transplantation beta-2 microglobulin level was higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in some patients; it was significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above complications compared with the pretransplantation level (1.57 +/- 0.57 mg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level and the beta-2 microglobulin level (r = 0.849) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some patients, however, the beta-2 microglobulin level increased earlier than the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level, and this finding was considered useful for the early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> following allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
