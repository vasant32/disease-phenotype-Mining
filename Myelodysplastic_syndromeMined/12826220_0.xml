<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method, however, does not provide information about specific lymphocyte subpopulations responding to different stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we modified previously described nonradioactive flow-cytometric T-cell activation assay measuring the expression of a CD69+ antigen on T-cell subsets and applied it to analysis of lymphocyte subsets activation/proliferation in children after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the percentage of spontaneously activated lymphocyte subpopulations (background) and the percentage of PHA-P, PWM, and SEB-stimulated cell subsets from two groups of patients: group 1, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus Host Disease</z:e> (GvHD) and group 2, children without any signs of GvHD at the time of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High rate of spontaneous T-cell subset activation was found in group 1 with CD3+CD8+Ts cells being the most affected cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High background activation of Th and B cells correlated with the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid quantification of CD69+ expression on unstimulated and stimulated T-cell subsets proved to be a valuable method for monitoring children after allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High proportion of activated, unstimulated Ts cells observed in the GvHD group may underline the critical role of CD3+CD8+ cells in the pathogenesis of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus in future immunosuppressive therapy may be adjusted according to the proportion of activated Ts cells </plain></SENT>
