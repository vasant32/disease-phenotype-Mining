<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between june 1988 and january 1992, cytogenetic studies were performed at the Cytogenetics Laboratory of the Abel Salazar Institute for Biomedical Sciences on 185 patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone-marrow and/or peripheral blood cells were used for such studies, two simultaneous cultures being prepared at 24 and 48 hr, plus another one, stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, at 72 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trypsin G-banding techniques were used for chromosome identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes were classified in accordance with the international system, and a clone was judged abnormal whenever two or more metaphases showed identical structural abnormalities or extra chromosome(s) and three or more metaphases lacked the same chromosome(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluable mitoses were found in 152 of the 185 cytogenetic studies performed (82.2%), pertaining to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (39/42), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (40/43), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (10/17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (30/36), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (10/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal alterations, previously described in each diagnostic variety, were found in 69% of the cases with abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (31%) had chromosomal abnormalities not reported consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The karyotype should be studied regularly in haematologic disorders since, although lacking precise prognostic implications, it may help gain information with regard to the genetic alterations in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
