<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Series I consisted of patient samples with numerical and/or structural abnormalities of chromosomes 7 or 8, matched with chromosomally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples from about the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Series II consisted of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient samples as well as patient samples in which one or more cells had numerical or structural abnormalities of 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both series, probes for chromosomes 7 and 8 were applied in each case and at least 100 nuclei were scored for each probe for the distribution of one, two, or three signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven cases had clonal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics (RC): 12 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7; one with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 8; five with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8; nine with clonal abnormalities other than 7 or 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cases gave abnormal interphase FISH (IF) results; one was subsequently confirmed by metaphase FISH analysis to have a clonal structural abnormality of chromosome 7; one case with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone, in remission by RC, showed 35% of cells by IF with three signals for chromosome 8; one case had heteromorphic chromosomes by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of eight remaining cases, five (four with -7 and one with +8 by IF) were among 22 cases of cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three remaining cases (two with +8 and one with both +7 and +8 by IF) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
