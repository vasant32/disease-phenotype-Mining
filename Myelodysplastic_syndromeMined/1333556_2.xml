<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and myeloperoxidase expression of this cell line, which was established from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who had an abnormal chromosome on the upstream region of 17p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron micrographs showed the cells to have a fragile and irregular cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SKM-1 cells were peroxidase-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 60% of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was released to the culture fluid from SKM-1 cells but only a few percent of MPO was released from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells into the culture fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> size of SKM-1 myeloperoxidase was 3.3 kb although there was a smaller size as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization of MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed strong staining in 5% to 10% of SKM-1 cells and of bone marrow cells from patients with myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 were positive </plain></SENT>
