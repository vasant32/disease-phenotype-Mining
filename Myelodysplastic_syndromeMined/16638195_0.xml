<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression rate and integral of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three proteins in the low-risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, high-risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients gradually increased, in addition to expression of Bcl-2 in low-risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The significant differences were observed in every two groups and there were positive relations between the every two proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that survivin, Bcl-2 and VEGF are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and related with the progression of this disease, the deregulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> through interaction among three proteins mentioned above </plain></SENT>
