<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with basophilic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> following a 2-year period with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The marrow showed 59.4% of blasts with 25.0% of mature and immature basophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukaemic blasts contained granules, positively stained with toluidine blue but negative for peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basophilic differentiation was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis demonstrating immature basophil granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a morphological transition from immature blasts to more mature basophils was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis of blasts and basophils showed positive for CD5, CD7, CD13, CD33 and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic investigation showed an abnormal karyotype, 46,XY,del(5)(q31q35), in 11% of the cells examined when the initial diagnosis of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, expansion of the same clone up to 100% was observed concomitantly with transformation to basophilic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
