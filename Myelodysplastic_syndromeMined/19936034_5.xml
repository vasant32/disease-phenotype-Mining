<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Particularly, we discuss the role of induction of hematopoietic stem cell (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) senescence via the p53-p21(Cip1/Waf1) and/or p16(Ink4a)-RB pathways in the induction of the injury and the therapeutic potential of molecularly targeting these pathways for amelioration of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced long-term BM toxicity </plain></SENT>
