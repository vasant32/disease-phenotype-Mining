<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antifungal prophylaxis posaconazole (P) is used during severe and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> resulting from chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and after autologous transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We realized a retrospective study in order to assess the efficiency of P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral prophylaxy dosage is 200mg every eight hours to beginning before presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure was defined as the occurrence of proven/probable invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (IFI), receipt of any other systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> for suspected IFI or for impossible swallowing and the occurrence of adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective is to note down the incidence of proven/probable IFI prevented by P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 22 patients of whom 86% suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P was prescribed in IFI prophylaxies during prolonged and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> postchemotherapy (72%) or postautologous transplant (28%) and initiated 7 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (50% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean treatment period was 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonization occurred in one third of patients (43% of Candida albicans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">Esomeprazole</z:chebi> (E) 40 mg was associated in 64% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>P prophylaxis failed in 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Proven/probable IFI occurred in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Different failure causes were: suspected or possible IFI (n=5) and impossible swallowing (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P prophylaxis seems to be efficient among these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, a P tardive initiation, an E association, P administration and resorption difficulties seem to have a importance in successful treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to optimize P treatment with plasmatic dosages to ensure efficiency and safety for patients </plain></SENT>
