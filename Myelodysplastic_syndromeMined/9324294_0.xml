<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the in vitro effects of IL-12, alone and in association with IL-2 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow and peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients and 14 healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural killer-activity (NK-a) levels and lymphocyte immunophenotypes were determined in fresh bone marrow (BMMNC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), which then were resuspended in medium containing IL-2, IL-12 or IL-2 + IL-12 for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Re-evaluation of NK-a levels, lymphocyte immunophenotypes, clonogenic activity and cytokine release showed that, unlike IL-2, IL-12 did not significantly increase NK-a or CD3-/56+ cell levels in either bone marrow or peripheral blood; IL-2 + 12 led to a significant increase that fell between the values reached by each cytokine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-2 + 12 and, although to a lesser extent, also IL-12 alone induced the release of large amounts of gamma-IFN and alpha-TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of clusters particularly decreased in the samples treated with IL-2 + 12 and IL-12 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic activity was not modified after stimulation with any of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IL-12 induces the release of inhibitory cytokines in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells and that it could be used in patients with elevated bone marrow blastosis </plain></SENT>
