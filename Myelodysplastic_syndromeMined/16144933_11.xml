<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) maybe mediated via <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and subsequent caspase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of proerythroid treatment with erythropoietin + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on myelodysplastic erythropoiesis regarding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and preferential growth of clones with cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), including 5q- aberration, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, before initiation of treatment and followed nine patients after successful treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of G-CSF and erythropoietin were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) was explored during erythroid maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative growth of erythroid progenitors with cytogenetic aberrations in presence of erythropoietin was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant redistribution of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> was seen before treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This release was blocked by G-CSF during the whole culture period and by erythropoietin during the latter phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both freshly isolated glycophorin A+ bone marrow cells and intermediate erythroblasts during cultivation retained their expression of G-CSFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and caspase activation were significantly less pronounced in progenitors obtained from successfully treated nonanemic patients and showed no further response to G-CSF in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, erythropoietin significantly promoted growth of cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells from 5q- patients, whereas no such effect was observed on erythroblasts from <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that growth factors such as erythropoietin and G-CSF can act both via inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of myelodysplastic erythroid precursors and via selection of cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors </plain></SENT>
