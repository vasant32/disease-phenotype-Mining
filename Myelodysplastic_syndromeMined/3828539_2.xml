<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two independent observers performed a double review of cytological and histological bone marrow material obtained at diagnosis and during follow up in 34 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), subtypes refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RA-S) (26 and 8 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Average values were used for the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data obtained at diagnosis confirmed earlier observations that a worse prognosis was indicated by high blast cell counts (P less than 0.01), presence of blast foci and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data obtained during follow up, in addition, showed that an increased probability of progression to FAB-subtype RA with an excess of blasts was related to both the occurrence of blast foci (P less than 0.05) and the occurrence of new or additional clonal abnormalities (karyotype shift) (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between parameters investigated at diagnosis, during follow up, and in the pooled material, points to RA-S being a separate entity having a better prognosis than RA, and further substantiates an earlier observed relationship between blast cell accumulation and the frequency of cytogenetically abnormal metaphases </plain></SENT>
