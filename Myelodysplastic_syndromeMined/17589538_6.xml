<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Refractory cytopenia (RC) is the most common subtype of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HSCT following a myeloablative preparative regimen is associated with a low probability of relapse and considerable transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present European Working Groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pilot study, we investigated whether a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) is able to offer reduced toxicity without increased rates of graft failure or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen children with RC were transplanted from an unrelated donor following RIC consisting of fludarabine, thiotepa and anti-thymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred at a median time of 23 and 30 days, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the predominant complications, only one patient with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD died from infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall and event-free survival at 3 years were 0.84 and 0.74, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results were comparable to those of patients treated with myeloablative HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is needed to demonstrate the expected reduction in long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
