<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> is occasionally observed, particularly in patients without a cytogenetic response to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed molecular studies in a patient with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> with complete erythroid and partial cytogenetic response to lenalidomide, who evolved to high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment marrow biopsies revealed a small fraction of progenitors with overexpression of p53 and sequencing confirmed a TP53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutated subclones have not previously been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with isolated del(5q) and indicates a previously unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aberrant subclone remained stable during the treatment with lenalidomide and expanded at transformation, suggesting that this pre-existing cell population had molecular features which made it insensitive to lenalidomide and prone to disease progression </plain></SENT>
