<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To understand how <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cells evolve from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells and gain competitive advantages over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, we established a murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> harboring bone marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>-related changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow CD34(+) cells obtained from patients were injected, with or without human mesenchymal stem cells, into the bone marrow of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/IL2RÎ³(null) hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment and differentiation of cells derived from the patients were investigated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Co-injection of patients' cells and human mesenchymal stem cells led to successful engraftment of patient-derived cells that maintained the immunophenotypes and genomic abnormalities of the original patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-originated clones differentiated into mature neutrophils, megakaryocytes, and erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the samples derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>-related changes were able to sustain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> into the next generation while these cells had limited differentiation ability in the murine host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hematopoiesis of mice engrafted with patients' cells was significantly suppressed even when human cells accounted for less than 1% of total marrow mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological studies revealed invasion of the endosteal surface by patient-derived CD34(+) cells and disruption of extracellular matrix architecture, which probably caused inhibition of murine hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We established murine models of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> using cells obtained from patients: the presence of neoplastic cells was associated with the suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> host hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of engraftment was related to the presence of an abnormality in chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
