<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and cytogenetic abnormalities other than inv (16), t(8;21), -Y or -X were randomized to receive liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DNX) and ara-C (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) or DNX and topotecan (DT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within each arm, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> or DT) or with thalidomide (DATh or DTTh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels and microvascular density was measured before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four patients (median age, 65 years; range, 27-84 years) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of 11 patients treated with DT or DTTh responded and these arms were closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 37 patients treated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and 15 of 36 treated with DATh achieved an early complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median complete response duration was 38 and 34 weeks (P = 0.57) and median survival 35 and 28 weeks (P = 0.15), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with high pretreatment VEGF levels had an inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the changes in VEGF levels or microvascular density after treatment in patients who did versus those who did not receive thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy does not result in clinical benefit in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
