<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancies</z:e>, we evaluated the aberrant promoter methylation of two imprinted genes (MEG3 and SNRPN) in 43 MDS and 42 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEG3 hypermethylation occurred in 15 MDS patients (34.9%), and in 20 AML patients (47.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNRPN hypermethylation was observed in 15 MDS patients (34.9%), and in 21 AML patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between WHO subtype, WPSS score, karyotype, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, white blood cell count, platelet count and CpG methylation of any gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEG3 hypermethylation was associated with significantly reduced overall survival in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (HR=1.98, p=0.04), while SNRPN CpG methylation was not associated with survival (HR=0.94, p=0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no association between survival and aberrant MEG3 (HR=2.15, p=0.072) or SNRPN methylation (HR=1.08, p=0.85) was observed in patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that these genes are abnormally methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and methylation of MEG3 confers worse overall prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MEG3 methylation status may serve as a useful biomarker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
