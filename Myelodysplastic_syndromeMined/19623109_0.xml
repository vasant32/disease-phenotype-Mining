<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He may be confronted with various clinical pictures corresponding to different pathophysiological causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Background There are few data in the literature relating only to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> or small series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non infectious pulmonary complications of myelodysplasic syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> can be classified into several clinical entities: tumoural syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> or diffuse infiltration, auto-immune reactions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e>, organizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp>..., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> and pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is provided by the histology and the management depends on the underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Viewpoints and conclusion Myelodysplasic syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> are entities which are becoming better characterized and understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Better knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these complications should improve their diagnosis and their management which still remains complex </plain></SENT>
