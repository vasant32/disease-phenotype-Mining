<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined a cohort of 193 MDS patients for mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1 (synonym U2AF35), ZRSR2, and, as described previously, SF3B1, in the context of other molecular markers, including mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, and DNMT3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 were found in 24 (12.4%), 14 (7.3%), 6 (3.1%), and 28 (14.5%) patients, respectively, corresponding to a total of 67 of 193 MDS patients (34.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P &lt; .001) and IDH1 (P = .013) mutations, whereas U2AF1 mutations were associated with ASXL1 (P = .005) and DNMT3A (P = .004) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, mutated SRSF2 predicted shorter overall survival and more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> progression compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> SRSF2, whereas mutated U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 had no impact on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, SRSF2 remained an independent poor risk marker for overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.13; P = .017) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> progression (hazard ratio = 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-6.12; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show a negative prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 mutations may become useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future </plain></SENT>
