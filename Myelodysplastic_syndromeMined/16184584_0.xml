<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After restriction digestion of samples, we detected a small number of female-derived cells within a large population of male-derived cells, with a sensitivity from 0.1% to 0.05% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chimerism was examined in four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>: two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and one patient each with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent myeloablative conditioning regimens and exhibited good clinical results during a median follow-up period of 6.6 years (range, 3.4-7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female-derived cells were detected throughout the entire follow-up period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow samples, but they became undetectable in the peripheral blood samples of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the HUMARA band pattern suggests that these residual host cells were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the usefulness of the HUMARA gene-based assay, which showed that patients undergoing HCT frequently show mixed chimerism (MC) for a long period, especially in bone marrow, although the possibility of contamination by host stromal cells cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
