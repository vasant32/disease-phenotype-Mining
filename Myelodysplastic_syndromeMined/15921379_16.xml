<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are now widely used as the source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still not clear which patients should receive mobilized PBPC or bone marrow cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis after myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to present 3-year-follow-up data on outcome (incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), overall survival (OS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>) after a PBPC transplant (PBPCT) or a bone marrow transplant (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 350 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were collected in a multicenter, randomized study initiated by the EBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to receive filgrastim-mobilized PBSCT or BMT from an HLA-identical donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 3 years, significantly more patients transplanted with PBPC than with bone marrow developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (73% vs 55%, p=0.003) and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD (36% vs 19%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher incidence and greater severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD had little impact on the patient's performance status or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OS was 58% for PBPCT recipients versus 65% among those undergoing BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> was 56% for PBPCT recipients versus 60% for BMT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients transplanted with PBPC from an HLA-identical sibling develop more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD than those transplanted with bone marrow, but the final impact of this difference is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is necessary to characterize the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD on quality of life, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
