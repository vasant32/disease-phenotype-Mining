<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emigrated cells were stained cytochemically for acid phosphatase reaction after 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to age-matched controls, seven patients showed a significant delay in lysosomal enzyme acquisition, which is associated with macrophage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results with this in-vivo assay demonstrate an involvement of the monocyte/macrophage system in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and show that patients often have a disturbance in macrophage differentiation </plain></SENT>
