<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed gene polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (NQOl), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-tranferase (GST)-MI and -TI, and CYP3A4, the enzymes of which are capable of metabolizing anticancer drugs, in 58 patients with TRL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in 411 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homozygous Ser/Ser genotype of NQOl at codon 187, causing loss of function, was more frequent in the patients with TRLIMDS (14 of 58, 24.1%; OR = 2.62) than in those with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (64 of 411, 15.6%), and control (16 of 150, 10.6%; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic frequencies of NQOJ were different between TRL/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In GST-MJ and -Ti, the incidence of homologous deletion was similar among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism of the 5' promoter region of CYP3A4 was not found in persons of Japanese ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the NQOJ polymorphism is significantly associated with the genetic risk of TRLIMDS </plain></SENT>
