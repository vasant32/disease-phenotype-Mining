<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent (40% major and 22% minor) and 50% erythroid responses were seen, and median response duration was 20 and 24 months according to IWG 2000 and 2006 criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher response rates were observed with less than 10% blasts, low and int-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), red blood cell transfusion independence, serum EPO level less than 200 IU/L, and, with IWG 2006 criteria only, shorter interval between diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly longer response duration was associated with major response (IWG 2000 criteria), IPSS low to INT-1, blasts less than 5%, and absence of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minor responses according to IWG 2000 were reclassified as "nonresponders" or "responders" according to IWG 2006 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, among those IWG 2000 minor responders, response duration did not differ between IWG 2006 responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate adjusted comparisons of survival between our cohort and the untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cohort used to design IPSS showed similar rate of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in both cohorts, but significantly better overall survival in our cohort, suggesting that epoetin or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> treatment may have a favorable survival impact in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
