<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy was compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the next 20 months the patient received transfusions of packed red cells, while a 3-month-trial of erythropoetin was unsuccesful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was then treated with thalidomide 400mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the next months, a gradual rise in Hb value was noticed and the patient eventually became transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat bone marrow biopsy revealed a significant decrease on the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide has shown excellent results in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> probably due to its anti-angiogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is possible that in our patient thalidomide acted as an anti-fibrotic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will be very interesting to test this novel activity of thalidomide in a large number of patients </plain></SENT>
