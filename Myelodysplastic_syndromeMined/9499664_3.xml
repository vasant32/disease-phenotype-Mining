<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the results of some pilot studies have shown the efficacy of the association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (IDA) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), already successfully employed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), for remission induction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to evaluate in a multicenter study the efficacy and tolerability of an intensive therapy with IDA and Ara-C in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, the rate and duration of complete remission, and the overall survival in adults treated with full doses and in the elderly treated with lower doses; furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of low-dose maintenance chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pretreated adult patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, meeting at least one of the following criteria, were included: neutrophils &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with infectious episodes, platelets &lt; 30 x 10(9)/L or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> symptoms, transfusion &gt; 4 red cell units/months, rapid increase of bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction treatment consisted of a cycle with IDA and Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult patients less than 65 years old were treated with the following doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6-hour infusion, on days 1-4, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients (&gt; or = 65 yrs) were treated with lower doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day 6 hours infusion, on days 1 and 2, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responders followed a consolidation course identical to induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From February 1994 to February 1997, 25 patients were enrolled, 20 males and 5 females aged between 22 and 76, 10 were &gt; or = 65 years old, 7 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and 18 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 7 cases (28%) achieved partial remission, 4 patients were resistant and two patients (8%) died during the aplastic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher CR rate was found in younger patients (p = 0.036), while gender, FAB subtype, presence of Auer rods, cytogenetic findings, and the interval from diagnosis to treatment did not significantly influence CR achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, treatment with IDA and Ara-C is associated with satisfactory frequency of response with acceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
