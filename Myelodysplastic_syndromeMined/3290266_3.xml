<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively more immature myeloid cells were found in the trephine biopsy specimens and relatively more polymorphs and lymphocytes in the aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two methods for sampling areas of the trephine biopsy specimens for counting were assessed, and the differences between aspirates and trephine specimens were found to be more consistent when the second, more extensive, sampling method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method also permitted quantitation of some features of bone marrow topography and provided information that would not normally be obtainable from aspirated material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The techniques were easy to apply and took relatively little time to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They could offer useful information in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e>, particularly those such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in which disturbances of marrow architecture are prominent </plain></SENT>
