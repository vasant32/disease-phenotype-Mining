<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Seven immunocompetent children, who presented at admission with concomitant cytopenias in blood and morphologic features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in bone marrow, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HHV-6 infection was secondary made by detection of HHV-6 DNA in plasma, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid and measurement of plasma antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears were examined at diagnosis and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologic recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was made according to the recommendations of the Third MIC Cooperative Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was the most frequent cytopenia (five of seven cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bi- or tri-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed in the marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Granulocytic and erythroid cells were always affected with dysgranulopoiesis and dyserythropoiesis scores equal to or higher than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was not due to a clonal disorder and disappeared gradually within 1 or 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that severe HHV-6 infection may induce reversible myelodysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings contribute to elucidate the pathogenicity of HHV-6 and furthermore suggest that HHV-6 infection must also be considered as a cause of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
