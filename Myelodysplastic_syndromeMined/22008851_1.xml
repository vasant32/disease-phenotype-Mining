<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed HLA-mismatched locus-specific comparison of the outcomes of 351 single-unit UCB and 1,028 unrelated bone marrow (UBM) adult recipients 16 years old or older at the time of transplantation who received first stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With adjusted analyses, HLA 0 to 2 mismatched UCBT showed similar overall mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.06; P = .149) compared with that of single-HLA-DRB1-mismatched UBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UCBT showed inferior neutrophil recovery (RR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.42-0.60; P &lt; .001), lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (RR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.42-0.72; P &lt; .001), and lower risk of transplantation-related mortality (RR = 0.68, 95% CI, 0.50-0.92; P = .011) compared with single-HLA-DRB1-mismatched UBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed for risk of relapse (RR = 1.28, 95% CI, 0.93-1.76; P = .125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA 0 to 2 antigen-mismatched UCBT is a reasonable second alternative donor/stem cell source with a survival outcome similar to that of single-HLA-DRB1-mismatched or other 7 of 8 UBMT </plain></SENT>
