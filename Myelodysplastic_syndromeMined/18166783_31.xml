<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>-T) was recently shown to be a JAK2-V617F mutation-related disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency and the prognostic significance of this mutation, we retrospectively evaluated 23 patients with platelet counts more than 600 x 10(9)/L, 15% ringed sideroblasts or more, and at least erythroid marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction for JAK2-V617F was used to determine the allelic ratio of the mutated JAK2 allele in DNA samples extracted from bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic and survival data of the JAK2-V617F positive vs. the JAK2-V617F negative patients were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was also used to screen for MPL-W515 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The JAK2-V617F mutation was present in 11 patients (48%) and was associated with significantly higher erythrocyte and white blood cell counts (p=0.009 and 0.011, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6/11 RARS-T patients the allelic ratio of JAK2-V617F was above 50%, indicating the presence of cells homozygous for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of these patients a transition from JAK2-V617F heterozygosity to homozygosity was documented and was accompanied by rising platelet counts in sequential samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MPL-W515L mutation was detected in one JAK2-V617F negative patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was found to be lower in the mutation-positive group than in the mutation-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>-T patients with JAK2-V617F have a more favorable prognosis than those without the JAK2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of homozygous JAK2-V617F mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>-T suggests that this entity is biologically distinct from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
