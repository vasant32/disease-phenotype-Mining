<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using STR technique combined with PCR, we analyzed the peripheral blood samples collected from 3 nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation recipients every 15 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quantitative results coincided with the qualitative results of DNA electrophoresis and with the clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the result of electrophoresis showed only donor's allele type we could still find out the recipient's specific allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The quantitative analysis using STR-PCR can detect more subtle changes in the evidence of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is a more efficient method for detect the hematopoietic chimerism post transplantation </plain></SENT>
