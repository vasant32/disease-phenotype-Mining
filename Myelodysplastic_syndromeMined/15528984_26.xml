<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this open label phase II study JM-216 was administered orally at the dose of 120 mg/m2/d for 5 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients continued on the therapy until evidence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation and de-escalation were allowed according to patient's tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients were enrolled onto the study and received a total of 155 courses (median 2, range 1-16) of JM-216 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose delays (77% of courses) and dose reductions (31% of courses) were common and were mainly due to myelosupression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was discontinued in 5 patients due to treatment related toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 11 months after the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent grade III or higher adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (52%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (24%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (16%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PSA response was assessed in 32 patients, 10 (26%) had partial response, 14 (36%) had stable disease while PSA progression was seen in 8 (21%) patients </plain></SENT>
