<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following intensive radiochemotherapy, patients received grafts which were partially depleted of T cells by the monoclonal antibody T10B9 and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Actuarial probability of engraftment was 86% (95% CI = 78-93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median day to engraftment was similar among recipients of grafts disparate at one, two or three antigen loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of severe (grades III and IV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 13% and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of disease-free survival for the entire cohort of patients is 31% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age &lt; or = 30 years, early or intermediate stage disease and a graft disparate at one or two loci predicted longer disease-free survival in multivariant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 47% of patients receiving PMRD grafts disparate at two loci who had both these favorable pretransplant characteristics were alive and free of disease 3 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that the utilization of PMRDs, especially those with two antigen disparate grafts, can extend allogeneic transplantation to additional leukemic patients lacking a histocompatible donor, with acceptable results </plain></SENT>
