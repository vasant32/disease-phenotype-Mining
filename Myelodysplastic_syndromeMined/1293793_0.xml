<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) diagnosed and treated in the same hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 99 patients diagnosed and treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in the Hospital San Carlos, in Madrid, between January 1976 and december 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical records were revised; the diagnosis and staging followed the Rye and Ann Arbor criteria, and the treatment included radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT), or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> was based upon clinical, analytical, radiological and histological records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age in the series was 31 years (16-82) and the M/F ratio was 61/38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stage distribution was: I-9; II-29; III-31, and IV-30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients received RT alone, 59 were treated with CT, and 14 received RT plus CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was found in 6 patients (6%), of whom 4 developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 2 a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had received MOPP or C-MOPP chemotherapy, associated in two of them with extensive RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> had been given CT+RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time of presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> since the diagnosis od <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> was 89 months (48-174) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 120 months for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have died, 2 for ANLL-M5, one for SRA and the remainder for cerebral haemorrhage, not yet evolved into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The two patients which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> are alive and seemingly in complete remission at 12 and 10 months, respectively, of the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> had been previously treated with CT (MOPP or C-MOPP) or CT+RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2) Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not appeared in any of the patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>3) An endless follow-up of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> seems important in order to achieve an early diagnosis of other malignant complications which, although in case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have poor prognosis, in case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> may do well with adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
