<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8 and stem cell factor of stromal cells derived from bone marrows of nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, eight patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) and seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblast-like cells and adipocytes in stromal cells showed no differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous expression occurred and this was augmented by LPS stimulation in cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When stimulated by LPS, the mean G-CSF and IL-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in patients with AA were significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, but there was one patient showing lower IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 expression with no response to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression of two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous and LPS-induced protein concentration of G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 in culture supernatants from 15, 10 and four patients, correlated well with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficients were 0 x 92, 0 x 78 and 0 x 91, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there were a few patients whose aetiology appeared to be reduction of stromal cytokine expression in AA, but most patients with AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> expressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high levels of cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
