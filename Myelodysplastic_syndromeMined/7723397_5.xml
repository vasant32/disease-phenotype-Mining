<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report three patients whose leukemic cells had multiple related clones resulting from unbalanced jumping translocations of 1q and 7q to chromosomes 1, 8, 15, 21 and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chromosome findings, together with limited published reports, suggest that jumping translocations are new non-random rearrangements and may represent poor prognostic biological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although their origin is unknown, circumstantial evidence suggests that telomeric ends of receptor chromosomes may play a role in stabilizing jumping translocations in dividing malignant cells </plain></SENT>
