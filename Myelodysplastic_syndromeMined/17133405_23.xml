<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors update their experience with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and analyze the cytogenetic response patterns and prognostic factors associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who received treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> 100 mg/m(2) per course every 4 weeks in 3 different schedules: 1) 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 5, 2) 20 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily x 5, and 3) 10 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> was given for a median of &gt;or=7 courses (range, 1-23 courses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 80 patients (70%) achieved a response according to the modified International Working Group criteria (IWG): complete response (CR), 40 patients (35%); partial response, 2 patients (2%); bone marrow CR with or without other hematologic improvements (HI), 26 patients (23%); and other HI, 12 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytopenias were improved in 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median remission duration was 20 months, and the median survival was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 3% at 6 weeks and 7% at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for achieving IWG CR were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), longer duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For survival, independent adverse prognostic factors were chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities, older age, and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> therapy (excluding growth factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The longer term experience with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment prognostic factors may predict the outcome of patients who receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
