<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited data are available concerning the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in patients who have lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated 74 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low-risk or intermediate 1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> on a national named patient program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 84% of patients were transfusion-dependent, 57% had received erythropoietin, and 51% were aged &gt;70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was administered subcutaneously for 5 days (n = 29 patients), 7 days (n = 43 patients), or 10 days (n = 2 patients) every month at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) daily (n = 45 patients) or at a fixed dose of 100 mg daily (n = 29 patients) and for a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-30 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the 2006 International Working Group criteria, overall response rate (ORR) was 45.9%, including complete responses (10.8%), partial responses (9.5%), hematologic improvements (20.3%), and bone marrow complete responses (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ORR was 51.6% in 64 patients who completed &gt; or = 4 cycles of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 6 months (range, 1-30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 15 months, 71% of patients remained alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A survival benefit was observed in responders versus nonresponders (94% vs 54% of patients projected to be alive at 2.5 years, respectively; P &lt; .0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> (21.6%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> may be a feasible and effective treatment for patients with lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
