<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because dysmegakaryopoiesis manifesting as an isolated cytopenia can be difficult to identify morphologically and because it may be accompanied by megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, RTC may be confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of 1,220 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville and Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1979 to 1990 yielded 9 cases (0.7%) of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (RTC) associated with clonal chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Review of 319 marrow chromosome analyses performed at the cytogenetics laboratory at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1979 to 1990 for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> yielded two additional cases of RTC (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 RTC cases, 3 previously had been misdiagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had oval macrocytes in peripheral blood smears and <z:mp ids='MP_0002417'>abnormal megakaryocyte morphology</z:mp> in bone marrow aspirates, lacked antiplatelet antibodies, and did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common clonal chromosome abnormalities involved chromosomes 3, 5, 8, or 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Steroid therapy was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory findings can establish the diagnosis of RTC and allow the physician to avoid recommending inappropriate therapy (steroids or splenectomy) for these patients </plain></SENT>
