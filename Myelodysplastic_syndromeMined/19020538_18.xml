<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the suppressor potential of T(regs) appears to be strongly influenced by their compartmentalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), immune deregulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in the early stages might lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and bone marrow (BM) failure, whereas late-stage disease is characterized by the immune escape of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that these two stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are associated with differential T(reg) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we found that in early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, T(regs) are dysfunctional and their BM homing through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is seriously impaired as a result of CXCR4 downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, T(regs) are systemically and locally expanded and retain their function and migratory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, T(reg) levels follow the disease course and are significantly reduced in treatment responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate T(reg) involvement in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; defective suppressor function and BM trafficking of T(regs) may be important in the autoimmune process of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but increased T(reg) activity could favor leukemic clone progression in late stage disease </plain></SENT>
