<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples MMP-2 was detected in rare myeloid cells, MMP-9 in most maturing myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> MMP-2 myeloid levels were higher than in controls (P &lt; 0.0001); MMP-2 and MMP-9 were often co-expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also many erythroblasts expressed MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between MMP-2 erythroblast expression and erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.002) and an inverse correlation between MMP-2 or MMP-9 myeloid expression and blast cell percentage (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High MMP levels in myeloid cells were associated with longer overall survival (P = 0.03) and evolution-free survival (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> MMP-2 levels were lower than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0001) and MMP-9 levels lower than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP levels did not predict response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release of active MMPs was detected by colorimetric analysis in cell cultures from representative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have demonstrated an abnormal MMP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The production and release of these enzymes may influence haematopoietic cell behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the detection of MMP deregulated expression may be important also from the clinical point of view: it may provide a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis and a possible target for experimental treatments </plain></SENT>
