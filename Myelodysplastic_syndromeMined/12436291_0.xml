<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions may accompany the initial manifestation or signal relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or coincide with blastic transformation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, even more rarely, primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myelosarcomas</z:e> may precede <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> by months or years or may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) that never progress to manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective evaluation a clinicopathological study on these latter two variants of isolated extramedullary manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was performed to elucidate certain aspects of site involvement and histopathology by application of enzyme and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we selected 6 patients presenting with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myelosarcoma</z:e> in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 patients revealing only uncharacteristic reactive changes of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 8 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following an observation time of up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal leukemic infiltrates were most often localized in the skin ( n=4), oral mucosa ( n=4), lymph nodes ( n=3), gastrointestinal tract ( n=3) or pleura and retroperitoneum ( n=3 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Myelosarcomas</z:e> were usually regarded by the clinicians as putative malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> unless further evaluation, especially involving chloroacetate esterase reactions as well as immunostaining with a panel of antibodies reactive with lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, CD68, CD43, CD56, CD117 and CD34 proved their true nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although at that time bone marrow findings were inconclusive, a straightforward diagnosis was reached by considering the possibility of a (primary) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myelosarcoma</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
