<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data obtained by PCR and/or serological techniques from a total of 730 cases showed that besides the expected presence of HTLV-1 in T-lymphoid diseases (2 of 27 cases), HTLV-1 was only detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), in which an incidence of 17% (11 of 65 cases) was found </plain></SENT>
