<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency and type of neurologic complications in children after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of the incidence and outcome of neurologic complications among 171 consecutive children transplanted in one center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 84 autologous and 87 allogeneic (47 matched sibling donors, 31 matched unrelated donors, 8 mismatched family donors, and 1 cord blood) transplants, 7 patients (4%) developed neurologic complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had undergone allogeneic transplantation (7/87 = 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had relapses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 3; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic in two and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic in one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 2), and adrenoleudystrophy X (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications occurred after a median follow-up of 1 month (range, 14 days to 19 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of seven patients, four died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications were the cause in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among the analyzed material the risk of neurologic complications was lower than in other studies and these events were observed only in children undergoing allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
