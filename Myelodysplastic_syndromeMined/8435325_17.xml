<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients presented with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and one in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast phase</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (83%) had megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 14 (58%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0008254'>increased numbers of megakaryocytes</z:mp>, but only four patients (16%) had absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> &gt; 500 x 10(9)/l (three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transforming to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review of 205 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> investigated in our institutions between 1985 and 1990 for whom cytogenetic results were obtained revealed that a platelet count &gt; 500 x 10(9)/l at presentation was highly suggestive of an underlying 3q abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A limited review of the literature on this subject confirmed that 15-20% of patients with a 3q abnormality will have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response of these patients to conventional antileukaemic therapy is uniformly poor, despite haematological and clinical differences between the subtypes of 3q rearrangements </plain></SENT>
