<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report long-term outcomes of AHSCT for patients with relapsed low-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between May 1983 and 2001, 67 patients with relapsed or refractory stage III and IV low-grade NHL received an AHSCT at the University of Minnesota at a median of 2.3 years (range, 0.4-15.2 years) after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At transplantation, 62 patients (92%) were in complete remission (CR) (6%) or partial remission (PR) (86%); 5 (8%) had resistant disease; and 9 (14%) had transformed to a higher-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After AHSCT, 32 (49%) of 65 evaluable patients achieved CR, and 26 (40%) achieved PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-62%) at 4 years and 33% (95% CI, 20%-46%) at both 10 and 18 years, whereas progression-free survival (PFS) was 28% (95% CI, 17%-39%) at 4 years, 18% (95% CI, 8%-28%) at 10 years, and 14% (95% CI, 4%-25%) at 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality in the first 100 days was 3% (95% CI, 0%-7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in 62% (95% CI, 48%-75%) at 4 years and 72% (95% CI, 56%-87%) at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (16%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> 1 to 8 years after AHSCT, and 3 (5%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score at transplantation was the most significant predictor for both OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median OS has not been reached in patients with an IPI score of 0 or 1 at transplantation (20 of 35 survive 2 to 18 years after AHSCT), whereas it was 2.3 and 1.6 years for IPI scores of 2 and 3, respectively ( P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A good response (CR/PR) to AHSCT (relative risk [RR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .04) and age &lt;50 years (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P = .01) were also independently significant predictors of good OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We present mature follow-up data (median follow-up, 8 years; range, 2-18 years) of patients undergoing AHSCT for relapsed low-grade NHL and demonstrate extended OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Very long-term remissions were seen in nearly 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AHSCT remains promising, especially for patients with sensitive relapse and lower IPI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after AHSCT remains the major problem, and prolonged survival is further tempered by a significant risk of post-transplantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
