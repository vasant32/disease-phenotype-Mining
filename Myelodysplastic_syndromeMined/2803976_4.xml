<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since MET is located on 7q and as Cooper et al (1984) showed that MET proto-oncogene could be activated by a chemical carcinogen, we tried to evaluate whether it could be implicated in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With specific probes for MET we analysed the DNA of 88 MDS patients (81 de novo and seven secondary cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 17 of them the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found no rearrangement or aberrant expression of MET in any samples studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results, however, do not rule out point mutations or rearrangement of other regions of MET or adjacent DNA regions </plain></SENT>
