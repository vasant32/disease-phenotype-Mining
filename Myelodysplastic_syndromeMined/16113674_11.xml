<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficacy of reduced-intensity stem-cell transplantation (RIST), we retrospectively compared outcomes of 207 consecutive Japanese patients aged between 50 and 59 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> who received RIST (n=70) and conventional stem-cell transplantation (CST) (n=137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CST recipients received total body irradiation (TBI)-based or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RIST regimens were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog-based (n=67), 2 Gy TBI-based (n=2), and others (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most CST recipients (129/137) received calcineurin inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> as graft-versus-host (GVHD) prophylaxis, while 32 RIST recipients received cyclosporin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 23 CST and five RIST recipients died without disease progression within 100 days of transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 56 CST and 38 RIST recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival between CST and RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis on OS, five variables were significant: preparative regimens (CST vs RIST) (hazard ratio=1.92, 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.97; P=0.003), performance status (2-4 vs 0-1) (2.50, 1.51-4.16; P&lt;0.001), risk of underlying diseases (1.85, 1.21-2.83; P=0.004), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (2.57, 1.72-3.84; P&lt;0.001), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (0.38, 0.21-0.69; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We should be careful in interpreting results of this small-sized retrospective study; however, reduced regimen-related toxicity might contribute to better survival in RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low relapse rates following RIST suggest a strong antitumor activity through allogeneic immunity </plain></SENT>
