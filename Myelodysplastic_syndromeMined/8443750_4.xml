<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">Idarubicin</z:chebi>, a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> analogue, is available in an oral preparation, and responses have been observed using relatively aggressive therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied whether a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose schedule would be effective but less myelotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received daily low-dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> in 5-week courses that included 3 weeks of treatment, followed by a 2-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses were escalated when possible after the second course, and each patient was to receive six courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only one partial response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no patient had fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow toxicity</z:e>, only eight patients received the full six courses, primarily because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This schedule of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> is relatively safe but produces fewer responses than are reported with the high-dose pulse regimens </plain></SENT>
