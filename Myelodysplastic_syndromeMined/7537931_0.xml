<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that CD34 antigen expression adversely affected the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no study has been published so far on clinical and prognostic significance of CD34 antigen expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsies from 58 patients diagnosed as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied using QBEND/10, a monoclonal antibody which recognized the human progenitor CD34 antigen on routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi>-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high percentage of CD34-positive cells (above 3% of total bone marrow nucleated cells) was predominantly observed in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and to a lesser degree in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But neither age, hemograms, bone marrow findings including percentage of blasts, ALIP, nor leukemic transformation correlated with the percentage of CD34-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median actuarial survival time in the high positive group was significantly shorter (12.0 months) than that of the low group (30.0 months; p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high CD34 aggregate (&gt; or = 3) was selectively found in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of bone marrow blasts (p = 0.007) and ALIP (p = 0.030) significantly correlated with number of CD34 aggregates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
