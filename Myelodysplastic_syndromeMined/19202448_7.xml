<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cord blood transplantation (CBT), donor-directed host antibodies may be particularly relevant because patients are often markedly mismatched to donors, and limited donor cells preclude cross-matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent development of single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) microbead array assays allows characterization of host alloreactivity to individual HLA antigens with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to allow consideration of "virtual crossmatch" testing as a surrogate for conventional crossmatch testing in the CBT setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report results of prospective monitoring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in our recent CBT experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 46 consecutive patients, four patients (9%) (5 of 88 units [6%]) had evidence of at least moderate antibodies to HLA antigens on cord units originally selected for transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virtual crossmatch can be used to screen for donor-directed antibodies in CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As possible, units should be changed to avoid sensitized mismatches </plain></SENT>
