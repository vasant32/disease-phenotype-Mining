<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise molecular mechanisms behind the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have remained elusive; however, the distinct sensitivity of this disease to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and the presence of markedly abnormal epigenetic profiles suggested the existence of an epigenetic mechanism underlying the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the advent of new technologies for the detection of genetic abnormalities has led to the description of a set of novel recurrent mutations in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of these novel mutations have been described in genes encoding different components of the epigenetic machinery, many of which are associated with distinct clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, mutations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing genes have also been described recently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, underscoring the molecular complexity that underlies the development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
