<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ages of these 8 patients (3 female and 5 male) ranged from 45 to 70 yr (median, 61.5 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 8 patients died 3-86 mo (median, 11 mo) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies of bone marrow cells with the Q-banding technique showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities in 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 chromosomally abnormal patients had very complex karyotypes; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients, however, had at least 1 of 4 specific changes: -5 (or 5Q-), -7, +8, and +21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 7 patients with abnormal karyotypes had had some exposure to potential mutagenic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 patients had serial cytogenetic analyses, 4 of which showed evolution of the karyotype to further complexity; in 2 cases, this coincided with the evolution of the disease into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of patients whose initial cytogenetic samples showed both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal metaphases was more than twice that of patients who had only abnormal metaphases initially (12 mo versus 4.5 mo) </plain></SENT>
