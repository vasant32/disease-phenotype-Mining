<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>11 of them (55%) had an increase in platelet counts by at least 30 x 10(9)/l and a disappearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> symptoms was seen in 6/6 patients with initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A response with neutrophil counts (six cases) or <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (five cases) was less often seen </plain></SENT>
