<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune cytopenias are manifested as monolineage or more rarely as bilineage cytopenias, and are usually mediated through humoral immune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is a rare event with only few cases reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exact pathogenesis of immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is not well known although it is possible that cellular immunity may play a significant role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of these syndromes lies in the fact that they can cause severe morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis from other causes of post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is of extreme value because these disorders can respond to various treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
