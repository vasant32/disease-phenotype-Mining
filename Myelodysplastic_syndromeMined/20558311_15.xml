<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outcome of patients with clinical relapse after transplantation generally remains poor, but intervention prior to florid relapse improves outcome for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To detect early relapse or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>, sensitive methods such as molecular genetics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific molecular primers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> in situ hybridization, and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) are commonly used after allogeneic stem cell transplantation to monitor patients, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them are included in the commonly employed disease-specific response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by molecular monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>- or patient-specific markers measured by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diseases have such targets for monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar high sensitivity can be achieved by determination of donor chimerism, but its specificity regarding detection of relapse is low and differs substantially among diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we summarize the current knowledge about the utilization of such sensitive monitoring techniques based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific markers and donor cell chimerism and how these methods might augment the standard definitions of posttransplant remission, persistence, progression, relapse, and the prediction of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Critically important is the need for standardization of the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> techniques and to assess the clinical relevance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and chimerism surveillance in individual diseases, which in turn, must be followed by studies to assess the potential impact of specific interventional strategies </plain></SENT>
