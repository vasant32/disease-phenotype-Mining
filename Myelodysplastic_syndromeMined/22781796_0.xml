<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-six primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with bone marrow (BM) biopsy were divided into two groups according to whether BM associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, the clinical features and prognosis of the two groups were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 167 (35.8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, of which MF-1 123 cases (26.4%), MF-2 40 cases (8.6%), MF-3 4 cases (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF group was significantly higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without MF group, the difference had statistical significance (\%P\% = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of BM biopsy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF group was significantly more active than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without MF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of blasts, megakaryocytes and abnormal megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF group were significantly higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without MF group, the differences had statistical significance (\%P\% &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 345 patients who had available results of cytogenetic analysis, 121 cases were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF patients, the proportion of middle and high-risk prognostic group according to IPSS karyotype prognosis groups in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF group were significantly higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without MF group, the differences had statistical significance (\%P\% = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 17 (1 - 60) months in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF group, and was 32 (1 - 62) months in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without MF group </plain></SENT>
