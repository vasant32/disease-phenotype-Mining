<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous gamete collection before HST may be a promising strategy to overcome <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: From October 1988 to December 2003, six male and nine female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> had autologous gametes collected before HST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data on autologous gamete collection were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sperm could be collected from three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in two of the three, the numbers and motility of the sperm were severely depleted because they received chemotherapy for one and 11 cycles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> sperm was only collected from one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who had no history of receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One or more oocytes could be collected in five of nine female patients, although the five received multiple cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The successful oocyte collection was associated with an ovulation stimulant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Autologous oocye collection before HST may be possible, even if patients receive multiple cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, autologous sperm collection before HST may be difficult after patients receive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successful pregnancy using autologous gametes after HST remains extremely difficult, especially in female patients; however, it is important to give information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> and autologous gamete collection to patients scheduled for HST </plain></SENT>
