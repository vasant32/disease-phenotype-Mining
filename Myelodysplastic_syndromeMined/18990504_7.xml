<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial, Radiation Therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group trial 9902, was undertaken to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4868">estramustine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (TEE) plus AS+RT would improve disease outcomes with acceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: High-risk (prostate-specific antigen 20-100 ng/mL and Gleason score &gt;or=7; or Stage T2 or greater, Gleason score 8, prostate-specific antigen level &lt;100 ng/mL) nonmetastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients were randomized to AS+RT (Arm 1) vs. AS+RT plus four cycles of TEE (Arm 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TEE was delivered 4 weeks after RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AS continued for 2 years for both treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT began after 8 weeks of AS began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Radiation Therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group 9902 trial opened January 11, 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excess thromboembolic toxicity was noted, leading to study closure October 4, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 397 patients were accrued, and the data for 381 were analyzable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term toxicity analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The worst overall toxicities during treatment were increased for Arm 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 192 patients, 136 (71%) on Arm 2 had RTOG Grade 3 or greater toxicity compared with 70 (37%) of 189 patients on Arm 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant increases in hematologic toxicity (p &lt; 0.0001) and gastrointestinal toxicity (p = 0.017) but not genitourinary toxicity (p = 0.07) were noted during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two Grade 5 complications related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutropenic infection</z:e> occurred in Arm 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> were noted in Arm 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At 2 and 3 years after therapy completion, excess long-term toxicity was not observed in Arm 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TEE was associated with significantly increased toxicity during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profiles did not differ at 2 and 3 years after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Toxicity is an important consideration in the design of trials using adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
