<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate, whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> would induce a response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 14 symptomatic patients (4 RA, 3 RARS and 7 RAEB) were treated with infusions of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate 3 mg/kg body weight on 4 consecutive days, mostly for six cycles at 2-week intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of 14 patients (21%) showed an improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (97-152, 79-120 and 92-114 g/l) within a few weeks, and 1 showed a milder increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (102-118 g/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 2 responders with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 1 showed an improvement in the platelet count (7-37 x 10(9)/l) and her regular need for red cell and platelet transfusions ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some regression in bone marrow (BM) cytology was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the responders is still in remission 41 months after cessation of the treatment, while in the other 2 the response lasted for 26 and 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients progressed during the treatment: 1 RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 1 RAEB to RAEBt and 2 RAEB, both with very complex chromosomal abnormalities at the beginning of the therapy, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML-M6</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">delta-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> synthase and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthase activities were generally low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, but not after the infusion procedure was changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other side-effects common to growth factors occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is likely that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate has a therapeutic effect on some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, obviously by stimulating erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The response may be long-lasting </plain></SENT>
