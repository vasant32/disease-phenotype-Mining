<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study examined hematologic outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among patients treated with HMAs in a large community hematology-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study using electronic medical record data studied patients who received at least one cycle of a single HMA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> [DAC] or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> [AZA]) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from June 1, 2006, to May 31, 2009, who had pretreatment and end-of-treatment Hgb, PLT counts, and ANC available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression assessed predictors of end-of-treatment response (Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL without transfusion or erythrocyte stimulating agent; PLT ≥ 100,000 cells/μL without transfusion; ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mm(3) without colony stimulating factor) adjusting for baseline laboratory values, age, gender, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HMA choice was studied as a predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 137 patients (mean age, 72.2 years; 57% male) met full inclusion criteria (DAC = 84, AZA = 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean number of cycles was four (range, 1-16 cycles) for DAC and five (range, 1-23 cycles) for AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total number of cycles significantly predicted Hgb, PLT, and ANC response (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, P = .029; OR 1.15, P = .031; OR 1.16, P = .047, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Growth factor use at any point during HMA treatment was negatively associated with Hgb and ANC response (OR 0.85, P = .007; OR 0.96, P = .046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between treatments in likelihood of PLT or ANC response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with HMAs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are more likely to achieve hematologic response when treated with a greater number of cycles </plain></SENT>
