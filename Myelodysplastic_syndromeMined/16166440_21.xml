<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-751 is an oral antimitotic agent that binds to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> site on beta-tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-751 in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two patients were treated: nine with 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 3), or 150 mg/m(2) (n = 3) of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-751 given orally once daily for 7 days every 3 weeks and 23 with 75 (n = 3), 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 5), 150 (n = 5), 175 (n = 3), or 200 mg/m(2) (n = 4) of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-751 given orally once daily for 21 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consenting patients had pharmacogenetic sampling and enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in one patient at 200 mg/m(2), with a subsequent patient developing grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> at the same dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> achieved a complete remission that was sustained for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four other patients had transient hematologic improvements, consisting of a decrease in peripheral blood blasts and improvements in platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEC number was reduced in three patients with a concomitant reduction in peripheral blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A previously undescribed nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, encoding Ala(185)Thr, was identified in exon 4 of the beta-tubulin gene, TUBB, in three other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recommended phase 2 dose in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> is 175 mg/m(2) daily orally for 21 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further assessment of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-751, especially in combination with other agents, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
