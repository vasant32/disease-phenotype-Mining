<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the sequence integrity of 4q24 candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene TET2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with UPD on chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The coding exons of TET2 were analyzed by 454 deep sequencing and Sanger sequencing in nine patients with UPD on 4q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>) and UPD4q24, and five patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-II, n = 1; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, n = 1; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>, n = 1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, n = 1; refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, n = 1) had no UPD4q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations on TET2 were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with UPD4q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were localized to exons 3, 6, and 9 and resulted in two premature stop codons, one frameshift mutation, and one cysteine to glycine amino acid change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant clone size varied between 30% and 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with UPD outside of q24 (UPD4q28.3) displayed additional TET2 mutations, but these were at low clonal levels (13%, 4%, and 4% for a silent mutation, a 180-base pair deletion in exon 3, and a lysine to phenylalanine substitution in exon 11, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other patients who did not have UPD4q24 did not have verifiable TET2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data identify novel TET2 mutations in a dominant clone in patients with UPD4q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of UPD4q24 and mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e> patients may suggest specificity to this subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results need to be confirmed in a large cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
