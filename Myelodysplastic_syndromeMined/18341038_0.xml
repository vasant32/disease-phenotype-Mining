<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> was admitted to our hospital for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, which was not improved with G-CSF and antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore decided to perform a GTX transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> did not deteriorate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and GTX is expected not only to improve transplantation results but also to expand the adaptation for transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, detailed investigation of the effect of GTX in allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be performed, and more cases should be accumulated </plain></SENT>
