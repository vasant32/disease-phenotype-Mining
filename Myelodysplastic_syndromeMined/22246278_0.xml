<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: BLU methylation status was investigated in bone marrow mononuclear cells from newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) treatment so as to determine the effect of BLU in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing were used to evaluate the methylation status of the promoter region of the BLU gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BLU expression was investigated by using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypermethylation in the promoter region of BLU was detected in 34 of 79 (43%) newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient samples and was significantly correlated with the loss of BLU <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in methylation frequency between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> (RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>/5q-) group and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-1/-2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e>) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of hypermethylation was observed in the intermediate-2/high-risk group compared to the low-risk/intermediate-1-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> could partly reverse hypermethylation and restore the expression of the BLU gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BLU promoter hypermethylation frequently occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, especially in higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, and is significantly associated with the downregulated expression of BLU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BLU gene re-expression was induced in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BLU may play a substantial role in the development and etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
