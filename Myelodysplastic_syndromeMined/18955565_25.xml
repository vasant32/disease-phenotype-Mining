<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multicenter study randomized 172 patients with untreated FL for either immunochemotherapy or high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by purged ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning was performed with total body irradiation (TBI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 9-year overall survival (OS) was similar in the HDT and conventional chemotherapy groups (76% and 80%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 9-year progression-free survival (PFS) was higher in the ASCT than the chemotherapy group (64% vs 39%; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A PFS plateau was observed in the HDT group after 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, OS and PFS were independently affected by the per-formance status score, the number of nodal areas involved, and the treatment group </plain></SENT>
