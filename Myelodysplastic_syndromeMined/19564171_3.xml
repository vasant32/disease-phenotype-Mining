<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the clinical and pathological features as well as the treatment results of a series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> arising after adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred to our institution during a 5-year period for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and who had received adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival for the whole group and for patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen women (14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of 15 patients had received an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with a latency period of 2 years or less from initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although mixed-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (MLL) rearrangement was the commonest chromosomal abnormality (8 of 15 patients), various other chromosomal abnormalities were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 15 patients underwent HSCT (11 allogeneic and one autologous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these 12 patients who underwent HSCT were in remission at a median follow-up of 20.4 months (range 4.4-53.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Durable remissions can be achieved in patients who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> secondary to adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and are able to undergo allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that HSCT should be an early consideration in the management of such patients who are suitable candidates for the procedure </plain></SENT>
