<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experience in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the activity and safety of 2 different doses (15 mg/m(2) vs 30 mg/m(2) daily Ã— 5 days) of intravenous clofarabine in patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients with a median age of 68 years (range, 25-89) including 15 patients (28%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> and 35 patients (60%) who received prior DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were adaptively randomized between the 2 dose cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR; based on a modification of International Working Group criteria) was 36% including 26% with complete remission (CR) (ORR, 41% at 15 mg/m(2) and 29% at 30 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were lower in patients who failed DNMT inhibitors (ORR, 17%; CR rate, 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 8-week mortality rate was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 7.4 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 13.4 months for responders, and 21.7 months for complete responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some adverse events, particularly hepatic and renal, were more severe (grade &gt;2) in patients randomized to 30 mg/m(2) of clofarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> and infectious complications were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the lower and higher doses of clofarabine have comparable clinical activity, but the lower dose appeared less toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If these results are confirmed, lower doses of clofarabine, possibly in alternative schedules, should be pursued </plain></SENT>
