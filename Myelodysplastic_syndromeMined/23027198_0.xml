<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Posaconazole is a broad-spectrum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38597">triazole</z:chebi> antifungal available as an oral suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data showed a high variability of plasma posaconazole concentrations (PPCs) in patients, suggesting a potential interest in drug monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our prospective study was to measure the PPCs in prophylactically treated patients to evaluate the impact of different factors on these concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 40 patients treated prophylactically with posaconazole for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> between February 2009 and August 2010, PPCs were measured at day 7 of treatment and then twice weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical data (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>, comedications, and treatment compliance), caloric and fat intake, and biological data were collected and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained 275 measurements of PPCs, with a median of 430 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PPCs were significantly lower in patients with mucositis (P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (P = 0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (P = 0.03), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPCs were higher in patients with a higher caloric intake (P = 0.02), while the proportion of fat intake had no influence on PPCs (P = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concomitant use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> decreased the PPCs (P = 0.02), while the use of tacrolimus increased the PPC (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the factors influencing the PPCs independently were the concomitant use of tacrolimus (P &lt; 0.001), the presence of mucositis (P = 0.01), and food intake (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed the high variability of posaconazole bioavailability and showed the significant influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>, food intake, and concomitant medication on the PPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal PPCs still remain to be defined and correlated with clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
