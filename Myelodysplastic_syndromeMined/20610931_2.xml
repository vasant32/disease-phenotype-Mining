<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 100-day cost-effectiveness model was developed following the Italian hospital perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probability of IFIs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from IFIs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes was obtained from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Health care sector resources (type, volume, unit cost) are given in Euros and refer to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The robustness of the cost-effectiveness model was tested via one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total costs for posaconazole (standard azoles) was estimated at Euros 3365.26 (Euros 2339.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Posaconazole is consistently more effective than standard azoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for avoided IFI (avoided overall mortality) with posaconazole is Euros 15,850.51 (Euros 18,038.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of such findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, posaconazole as a prophylaxis in neutropenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who are at risk of IFI is good value for money for Italian hospitals </plain></SENT>
