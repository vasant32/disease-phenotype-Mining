<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES/METHODS: This 1-yr prospective phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in regularly transfused patients aged 3-81 yrs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 47), Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>; n = 30), other rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo> (n = 22) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e> (n = 85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dosage was determined by baseline liver iron concentration (LIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with baseline LIC &gt; or = 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> initiated at 20 or 30 mg/kg/d produced statistically significant decreases in LIC (P &lt; 0.001); these decreases were greatest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and least in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As chelation efficiency and iron excretion did not differ significantly between disease groups, the differences in LIC changes are consistent with mean transfusional iron intake (least in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 0.28 +/- 0.14 mg/kg/d; greatest in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>: 0.4 +/- 0.11 mg/kg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, LIC changes were dependent on dose (P &lt; 0.001) and transfusional iron intake (P &lt; 0.01), but not statistically different between disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in serum ferritin and LIC were correlated irrespective of disease group (r = 0.59), supporting the potential use of serum ferritin for monitoring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> had a safety profile compatible with long-term use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no disease-specific safety/tolerability effects: the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> and non-progressive serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> is effective for reducing iron burden with a defined, clinically manageable safety profile in patients with various transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no disease-specific adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once differences in transfusional iron intake are accounted for, dose-dependent changes in LIC or serum ferritin are similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and other disease groups </plain></SENT>
