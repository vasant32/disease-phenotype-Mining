<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients received <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> administered subcutaneously once a week for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated at 150 microg fixed dose and was doubled if after the first 12 weeks there was no or suboptimal erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final response rate was 24/53 (45%), with 21 major and three minor responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the responses (21/24; 87.5%) were obtained at the dose of 150 microg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 17 patients maintain their response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated with no relevant side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression was observed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were positively correlated with improved QoL scores using both the linear analog scale assessment (energy level, r = 0.429, P = 0.036; daily activities, r = 0.653, P &lt; 0.001; overall well-being, r = 0.457, P = 0.024) and the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> questionnaire (r = 0.247, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only low levels (&lt;200 IU/l) of endogenous erythropoietin predicted response to <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> is an active, safe and well tolerated treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in a substantial proportion of patients with low- and intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and has a positive impact on the patients' QoL </plain></SENT>
