<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progenitor cells were mobilized with rhG-CSF, alone or in association with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were harvested by leukapheresis until at least 2 x 10(6) CD34+/kg body weight were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 194 leukaphereses were performed (median = 3 per patient, range 1-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A median of 3.40 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg (range 0.31-27.59) and a median of 7.15 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg (range 1.31-115.70) were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regardless of transfusional support or patient diagnosis, engraftment was rapid in patients who had received &gt; or = 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case, absolute neutrophil blood count &gt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l was obtained on day 12 post graft (range 7-19) and platelet count &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/l was also reached after the same median time interval (range 8-121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the present results, a minimal threshold of 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg appears to be suitable for providing rapid and complete hematopoieitc reconstitution in patients exposed to high doses of chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of rhG-CSF during post-graft period significantly decreased the neutrophil time recovery (P = 0.002) but not that of platelets (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
