<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs in 1-2.5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and is also observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular consequence of the inv(3)/t(3;3) rearrangements is the juxtaposition of the ribophorin I (RPN1) gene (located in band 3q21) with the ecotropic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration site 1 (EVI1) gene (located in band 3q26.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following conventional cytogenetics to determine the karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a panel of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome clones was used to map the breakpoints involved in 15 inv(3)/t(3;3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inv(3) or t(3;3) was the sole karyotypic anomaly in 6 patients, while additional abnormalities were identified in the remaining 9 patients, including 4 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome7 (-7) or a deletion of its long arm (7q-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints in band 3q21 were distributed in a 235 kb region centromeric to and including the RPN1 locus, while those in band 3q26.2 were scattered in a 900 kb region located on each side of and including the EVI1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to most of the inversions and translocations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that lead to fusion genes, inv(3)/t(3;3) does not generate a chimeric gene, but rather induces gene overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The wide dispersion of the breakpoints in bands 3q21 and 3q26 and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the genomic consequences could explain why the mechanisms leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to further characterize these chromosomal abnormalities by FISH </plain></SENT>
