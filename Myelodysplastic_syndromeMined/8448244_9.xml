<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have pointed out that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with blastic aggregates or severe bone marrow (BM) <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> are characterized by a worse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMBs of 106 MDS patients were retrospectively reviewed, and relationships among the different histological parameters as well as clinicopathological correlations were looked for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of BM blastic infiltration ("diffuse," "cluster," and "large") were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overt leukemic transformation and overall survival were selected as prognostic end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BM infiltration was "diffuse" in 18, "cluster" in 48, and "large" in 40 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t patients accounted for about half of the "large" cases, and none had a "diffuse" pattern (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients showed extensive BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>; most of them were characterized by "cluster" blastic infiltration and megakaryocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukemic transformation occurred in 67% of "large" cases (p&lt; 0.001) and in none of the "cluster" cases with severe BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.01); however, survival was equally poor in these two groups because of early leukemic transformation (large cases) and BM failure (cluster cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FAB classification did not significantly correlate with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with "cluster" BM infiltration and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> can be regarded as a true separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subset characterized by unique clinicopathological and prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> clinical behavior of most cases, and the poor performance status of many elderly patients, there is still controversy as to the best therapeutic approach in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis allowed two groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to be identified, both characterized by poor life expectancy, who could benefit from early aggressive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
