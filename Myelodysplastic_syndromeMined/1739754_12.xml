<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell transfusion requirements diminished in four patients, and one of the patients eventually became transfusion independent with an EPO-induced rise of Hb from 7.7 g/dl to 12.3 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous serum levels of EPO were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100-5700 mU/ml), but three of four responders had a relatively low baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effective red cell iron turnover (RCIT) improved in two responding patients and even normalized in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increase in RCIT was accompanied with a decline in the ineffective red cell iron turnover (IIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other responding patients had a relatively preserved RCIT before EPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPO therapy further increased the fraction of IIT in the latter patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Red cell survival time did not increase during EPO therapy, even in the responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One transient and one maintained increase in platelet count were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease progression with a sustained increase in blast cells in one patient and a transient elevation of blasts in another patient was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other side effects of EPO therapy were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low serum EPO levels and relatively spared effective erythropoiesis as measured by ferrokinetic studies may be the best candidates for treatment with recombinant human EPO </plain></SENT>
