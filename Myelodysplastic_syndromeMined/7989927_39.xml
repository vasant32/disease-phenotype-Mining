<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, natural history, and risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) occurring as a late complication following autologous bone marrow transplantation for patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 262 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the Dana-Farber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute from 1982 through 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although patients received a variety of treatments before they were eligible for transplant, identical myeloablative therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg/d for 2 days plus total-body irradiation twice daily for 3 days) was administered in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By collecting data on pretransplant and early posttransplant variables, we attempted to identify risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude overall incidence of posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was 7.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial risk at 6 years was 18% +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 31 months (range, 10 to 101) after transplant or 69 months (range, 27 to 141) after initial treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment variables predictive for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (univariate analysis) included prolonged interval between initial treatment and the transplant procedure (P = .003), increased duration of exposure to chemotherapy (P = .019) or to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (P = .045), and use of radiation therapy (P = .032) or pelvic radiation (P = .003) before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a potential complication of autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; bone marrow stem-cell damage sustained before the transplant may be the most important risk factor </plain></SENT>
