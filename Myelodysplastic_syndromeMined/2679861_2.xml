<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) mature and immature erythropoietic (CFU-E, BFU-E), granulopoietic (CFU-GM) and megakaryopoietic (CFU-Meg) colony formation from human bone marrow mononuclear cells was evaluated in a microagar culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but three patients exhibited abnormal CFU-Meg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defect of CFU-Meg paralleled the reduction of BFU-E, whereas CFU-GM number declined to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not only the CFU-Meg number, but also the number of megakaryocytes (Mk) per colony was reduced suggesting an additional functional CFU-Meg defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytic growth factor (Meg-CSF) abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were detected using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonadherent T-lymphocyte depleted bone marrow cells as target cells for serum testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even for sera from patients with a reduction of platelets and bone marrow megakaryocytes Meg-CSF levels were not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cellular or humoral inhibition could be detected in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient with a 5q- karyotype, who had an isolated defect of the megakaryocytic cell lineage at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients revealed a spontaneous formation of mixed erythrocytic, granulocytic and megakaryocytic clusters in the presence of fetal calf serum or autologous patient serum, probably representing autonomous proliferation of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both cellular and humoral factors can cause abnormalities of the megakaryocytic cell lineage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
