<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with blastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> types had a shorter survival and a higher probability of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complex chromosomal abnormalities at the initial evaluation identified a subgroup of patients with a high risk of a short survival and/or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> the presence of complex chromosomal abnormalities was linked with a relative risk of 3.58 of leukemic transformation and shorter survival as compared with other cytogenetically defined groups </plain></SENT>
