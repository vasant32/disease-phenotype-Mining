<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although in 9 patients no evidence of peripheral blood T-cell and only 1 case of B-cell involvement was found, the data herein support that 5q deletions occur in hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) with a combined lympho-myeloid potential </plain></SENT>
