<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently evaluated the microvessel densities in trephine biopsy sections of seventeen patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 cases, 2 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, 3 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, one was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and 11 were of the subtype RA (FAB subtyping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microvessel counts were measured in the bone marrow biopsy sections by immunohistochemical staining, using CD34 reactive monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MVD was significantly higher in the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t as compared to the cases of RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average MVD per x400 in the cases of RA was 5.7 +/- 4.7 with a median value of 4.65 (range 19) whereas it was 45.4 +/- 10.0 and 44.0 (range 27.3) respectively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t (p &lt;.001), the 95% confidence interval being (2.94, 8.5) and (36.6, 54.3), for the two groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding may imply that subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a higher tendency for converting to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> as compared to other subtypes where the risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is much lower </plain></SENT>
