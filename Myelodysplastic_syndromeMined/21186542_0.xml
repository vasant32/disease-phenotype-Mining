<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 30-40% of the potential patients for allogeneic SCT have an HLA identical sibling, due to the fact that families in most of the developed countries are relatively small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study gives a general model for calculating the needs for allogeneic SCT which, enables calculation of the needs for allogeneic SCT per 1 million inhabitants of Vojvodina on basis of number of potential patients who could be treated by allogeneic SCT The number of beds required for transplanted patients, and of days in hospital per year as well as the estimation of financial aspect of allogeneic SCT have been calculated by means of the cummulative risk method, considering the following parameters: the relative number of patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 45 and 55-year-old and younger, total incidence/ 100,000 inhabitants for each investigated disease and the average number of days in hospital of transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total annual needs for allogeneic SCT for the patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> together, in transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 786 days, from the unrelated donors are 306 days, while for nonmyeloablative transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 558 days and from the unrelated ones are 297 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The general calculating model of the needs for allogeneic SCT could be used as a basis for planning a regional bone marrow donor registry and for creating a similar calculating model of the needs for allogeneic SCT in other diseases treatable by HSCT </plain></SENT>
