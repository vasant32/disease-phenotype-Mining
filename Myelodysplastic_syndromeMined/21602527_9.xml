<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined plasma levels of 2 miRNAs, let-7a and miR-16, in 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 76 healthy persons using quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of both miRNAs were similar among healthy controls but were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (P = .001 and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of these 2 miRNA levels were bimodal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and these levels were significantly associated with their progression-free survival and overall survival (both P &lt; .001 for let-7a; P &lt; .001 and P = .001 for miR-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association persisted even after patients were stratified according to the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that let-7a level was a strong independent predictor for overall survival in this patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that let-7a and miR-16 plasma levels can serve as noninvasive prognostic markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
