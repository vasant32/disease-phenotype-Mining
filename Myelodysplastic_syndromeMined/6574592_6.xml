<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme was partially purified and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On grounds of: (a) reduced electrophoretic mobility, (b) abnormal cathodic band(s) in isoelectrofocusing, (c) increased Michaelis constant for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate, (d) abnormal thermostability, and (e) abnormal interaction with the ligand <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>, we conclude that this is a new structural variant which we designate G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> Verona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> Verona was the sole apparent source of G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> activity in the patient's erythrocytes; by contrast, the patient's fibroblasts had only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G-6-PH (type B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's haematological course terminated into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> Verona was the result of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in an X-chromosome which took place in a haemopoietic cell clone which subsequently underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
