<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody HuM195 specifically targets myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in vivo and has been shown to produce molecular remissions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> who are in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous human trials have used low intermittent dosing of HuM195 at 3 mg/m2/day, which is adequate to saturate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available CD33 sites in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current trial, we investigated supersaturating doses of HuM195 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with relapsed or refractory myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>) were treated on days 1-4 and 15-18 with a 4-h daily infusion of HuM195 at three different dose levels: 12, 24, and 36 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total maximum dose of HuM195 was 576 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicities were grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and rigors, seen more frequently at the highest dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a transient and reversible drop in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of 1-3 g/dl was seen during the infusion in several patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis showed that antigen sites in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) remained saturated with HuM195 during the entire 4-week trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At these high doses, the average plasma half-life of HuM195 was approximately 1 week, compared to 38 h, seen in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human anti-HuM195 immune responses were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, whose disease was refractory to two rounds of chemotherapy, with &lt; 10% blasts in his BM, achieved a complete remission, lasting &gt; 32 months, at the first dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another three patients showed a reduction in leukemic BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that high doses of HuM195 achieve a long serum half-life, with tolerable toxicity and without immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, antileukemic activity was seen </plain></SENT>
