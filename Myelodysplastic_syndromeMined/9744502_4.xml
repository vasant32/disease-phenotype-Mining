<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells obtained from donors of the Clinical Hospital of this university were used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autonomous proliferation, evaluated by clonal culture without exogenous growth factor, and the number of apoptotic cells in bone marrow kept for 10 days in liquid cultures at 37 degrees C and 5% carbon dioxide, were significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in control subjects (P = 0.001, Wilcoxon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, bcl-2 expression, measured by immunocytochemistry, was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (P = 0.002, Wilcoxon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the high proliferation activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may be counteracted by the high level of medullar cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which might be related to the lower bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
