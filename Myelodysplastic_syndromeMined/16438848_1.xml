<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human erythroleukemic cell line K562 and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-resistant counterpart K562/A02 were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies against P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gP), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> resistance protein (BCRP) were immobilized onto <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> film-coated glass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antibody-cell binding was assessed by capturing K562 and K562/A02 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein array was observed under a microscope and the image was captured with a CCD camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of the three proteins were also measured by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of P-gP and BCRP in K562 was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, MRP1 expression was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-gP and MRP1 were highly expressed in K562/A02, while the expression of BCRP was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FCM results showed that the expression rate of P-gP, MRP1 and BCRP in K562 cells was 5.98% +/- 2.19%, 95.80% +/- 3.98%, 1.03% +/- 0.45%, respectively, while that in K562/A02 cells was 92.67% +/- 1.80%, 97.18% +/- 1.02%, 3.98% +/- 0.37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of protein array method are consistent with those of FCM (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is feasible to develop a new protein array technique and to provide a novel method for multi-drug resistant cell detection, with a high throughput, high specificity, simple procedure and low cost </plain></SENT>
