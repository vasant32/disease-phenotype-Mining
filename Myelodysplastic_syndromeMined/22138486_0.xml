<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quantitative evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is indispensable for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> markers such as immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, fusion genes, or aberrantly expressed genes, single nucleotide mutations are considered one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> markers that reflect the malignant cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the quantity of mutant genes by allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (AS-qPCR) for single nucleotide mutations (TP53 410T&gt;A and PTPN11 1508G&gt;A) with the percentage of autologous DNA by short tandem repeat (STR)-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following HSCT, the quantity of mutant genes detected by AS-qPCR correlated with the percentage of autologous DNA assessed by the STR-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mutant DNAs were detected at a quantifiable level before relapse, whereas the percentage of autologous DNA was less than 5%, that is, complete chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AS-qPCR approach for single nucleotide mutations was accurate and highly sensitive for monitoring pre-transplantation as well as post-transplantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AS-qPCR for single nucleotide mutation is suitable for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in patients who lack previously established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
