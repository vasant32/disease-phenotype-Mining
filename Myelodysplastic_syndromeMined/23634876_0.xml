<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to repeated blood transfusions, he developed platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) to platelets from cross-matched donors as well as random donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-HLA class I antibodies were positive with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, HLA-compatible platelet products were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTR was unresponsive to high-dose immunoglobulin and plasma exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was then treated with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and 100 mg total dose on days 15 and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Already after the first dose of rituximab, the patient was able to received successful platelet transfusion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore rituximab may be considered as a potential therapy for PTR </plain></SENT>
