<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using PCR and FISH analysis on hybrid lines containing the human derivative 16 chromosome, the breakpoints could be mapped between the markers TCF-7 and IL-9 on chromosome 5 and OL-7 and s30A4 on chromosome 16, both regions spanning approximately 1 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the breakpoint on 5q has occurred in a region that is frequently deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, the gene disrupted by this translocation could also be implicated in this aberration </plain></SENT>
