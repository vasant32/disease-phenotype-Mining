<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the late 1980s, a growing body of evidence has documented that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> and their metabolizing enzymes, which regulate a large variety of cellular functions both in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, are present also within the nucleus, where they are involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> metabolism operates independently from that present elsewhere in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> generate second messengers such as diacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5 trisphosphate, it is becoming increasingly clear that they may act by themselves to influence chromatin structure, gene expression, DNA repair, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The understanding of the biological roles played by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> is supported by the recent acquisitions demonstrating the presence in the nuclear compartment of several proteins harboring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-binding domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these proteins have functional roles in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing/processing and chromatin assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent evidence shows that nuclear phospholipase CÎ²1 (a key <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> metabolizing enzyme) could somehow be involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, i.e. a hematopoietic disorder that frequently evolves into an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review aims to highlight the most significant and updated findings about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> metabolism in the nucleus under both physiological and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
