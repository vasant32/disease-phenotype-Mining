<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we gave immunosuppressive therapies to eight patients with normo- or hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> subtype without karyotypic abnormalities and analyzed the HLA-DRB1 type or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) neutrophils in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) therapy was effective for improving cytopenia in four of the eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the side effects of CyA were mostly mild and transient, one patient demonstrated karyotypic abnormality following CyA therapy and accelerated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy was effective in one of three nonresponders to CyA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to leukemic transformation after ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed the correlation between the response to CyA therapy and the HLA-DRB1 type, there were more responders with DRB1*1501 (three of four patients) than without (one of four patients), but a statistically significant difference was not evident between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> neutrophils was not correlated with the response to CyA and/or ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the usefulness of immunosuppressive therapies even for normo- or hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further trials using more patients with a long follow-up period would be worthwhile in order to clarify the possibility of disease progression and in order to predict the response of patients </plain></SENT>
