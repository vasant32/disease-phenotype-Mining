<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transfusion-dependency is associated with poor prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> although the causal link for such association is disputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests thee hypotheses on the association between transfusion burden and prognosis in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: (1) the cumulative transfusion burden is a confounder merely reflecting the time elapsed from diagnosis; (2) it is a surrogate for higher transfusion intensity, which would reflect a more severe disease; and (3) it is the total amount of transfused RBC units that influences on prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 191 transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfusion intensity was calculated at the time of each transfusion as the yearly-equivalent number of RBC units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival from first transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median transfusion burden was 30 (range: 4-330) RBC units and 112 patients received ≥ 25 units after a median of 9 months from first transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nested Cox models, having received ≥ 25 RBC units had a significant effect on survival (P &lt; 0.001) that was not abrogated by including follow-up ≥ 9 months as a time-dependent covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including transfusion intensity in the model had a significant effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (P &lt; 0.001) and cancelled the prognostic value of having received ≥ 25 RBC units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transfusion intensity, instead of the cumulative transfusion burden, is the transfusion-related variable really influencing on the prognosis of patients with transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
