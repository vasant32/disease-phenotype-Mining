<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the role of the recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification for assessing prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this effect, we analyzed the prognostic impact of the WHO and French-American-British (FAB) morphologic classifications and of four different scoring systems in a series of 311 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed between October 1990 and June 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the FAB and WHO classifications identified groups with different prognoses (p&lt;0.0001), those presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) showing the best prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WHO classification subdivided RA into RA with only red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> plus refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our population, we have shown that the two subtypes characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> affecting exclusively the erythroid population (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) have a better prognosis, with a median survival of 122.2 and 81.9 months, respectively, than those with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>) with a median survival of 32.3 and 43.2 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in median survival comparing RA with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (p&lt;0.95), or comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> with RSCMD (p&lt;0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, the four scoring systems discriminated our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in terms of survival, and an increase in prognostic capacity was achieved on adding the score to the morphological classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk scoring had a greater prognostic impact than the FAB and WHO classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prognostic scoring systems may be an important tool for risk stratification in hematological practice, and add significance to morphological classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined application of the WHO classification and score system is useful for improving the identification of patients with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The WHO classification establishes more homogeneous subcategories than the FAB classification and is also able to identify groups with different prognoses </plain></SENT>
