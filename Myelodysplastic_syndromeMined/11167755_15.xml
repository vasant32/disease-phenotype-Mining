<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1, a 5-year-old male with FA and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, initially received an HLA two-antigen mismatched unrelated cord blood transplant and failed to engraft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He received fludarabine (Flu) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy), followed by a CD34(+) E-rosette(-) (CD34(+)E(-)), T cell-depleted, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSCT from his HLA B-DRB1 mismatched father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), steroids, FK506 and G-CSF after transplant for rejection and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient is now 23 months after SCT with no evidence of GVHD and with full haematopoietic and immune reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2, a 10-year-old boy with FA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, received single-dose total body irradiation (SDTBI), Flu and Cy followed by a CD34(+)E(-), T-cell-depleted, G-CSF-mobilized PBSCT from his HLA B-DRB1 mismatched sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He also received ATG, steroids, FK506 and G-CSF after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient is now 12 months after SCT in complete remission with no evidence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of &gt; 1 x 10(9)/l were achieved on day 11 and day 10 post transplant respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both patients are fully engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report two successful T-cell-depleted stem cell transplants from mismatched related donors for the treatment of Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, using a fludarabine-based cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both patients experienced minimal toxicity, rapid engraftment and no GVHD </plain></SENT>
