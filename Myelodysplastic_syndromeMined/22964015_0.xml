<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">Arsenic Trioxide</z:chebi> (ATO) is effective in about 20% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); its mechanisms of action have already been evaluated in vitro, but the in vivo activity is still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since ATO induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in in vitro models, we compared the expression of 93 apoptotic genes in patients' bone marrow before and after ATO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this analysis, we selected 12 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who received ATO in combination with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">Ascorbic Acid</z:chebi> in the context of the Italian clinical trial NCT00803530, EudracT Number 2005-001321-28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real-time PCR quantitative assays for genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were performed using TaqMan® Assays in 384-Well Microfluidic Cards "TaqMan® Human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> Array".Quantitative RT-PCR for expression of EVI1 and WT1 genes was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression values (Ct) were normalized to the median expression of 3 housekeeping genes present in the card (18S, ACTB and GAPDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ATO treatment induced up-regulation of some pro-apoptotic genes, such as HRK, BAK1, CASPASE-5, BAD, TNFRSF1A, and BCL2L14 and down-regulation of ICEBERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases with stable disease, apoptotic gene expression profile did not change, whereas in cases with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> more frequently pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients achieved a major response: in the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> the treatment down-regulated 69% of the pro-apoptotic genes, whereas 91% of the pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated in the patient affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responsive patients showed a higher induction of BAD than those with stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, WT1 gene expression was down-regulated by the treatment in responsive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the basis for a possible association of ATO with other biological compounds able to modify the apoptotic pathways, such as inhibitors of the BCL2 family </plain></SENT>
