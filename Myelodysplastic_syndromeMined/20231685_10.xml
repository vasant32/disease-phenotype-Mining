<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE Juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>) is a rare early childhood myelodysplastic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> characterized by an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> F percentage at diagnosis have been reported to predict both survival and outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no genetic markers with prognostic relevance have been identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied gene expression-based classification to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> samples in order to identify prognostic categories related to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Samples of 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> were available for microarray gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic classification (DC) model developed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> classification was used to classify the specimens and identify prognostically relevant categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to determine the prognostic value of the classification and the genes identifying prognostic categories were further analyzed through R software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The samples could be divided into two major groups: 20 specimens were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) -like and 20 samples as nonAML-like </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients could not be assigned to a unique class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 10-year probability of survival after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like and nonAML-like patients was significantly different (7% v 74%; P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the 10-year event-free survival after HSCT was 6% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like and 63% for nonAML-like patients (P = .0010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Gene expression-based classification identifies two groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> with distinct prognosis outperforming <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known clinical parameters in terms of prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gene expression-based classification could thus be prospectively used to guide clinical/therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
