<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromosomal abnormalities of 532 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were categorized according to cytogenetic categories of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), Revised IPSS (IPSS-R), and German-Austrian (G-A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic impacts of different cytogenetic categories and frequent isolated anomalies were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 532 patients, 346(65%) patients had clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, including 200(38%) patients had 1 abnormality, 61(11%) patients had 2 abnormalities, and 85(16%) patients had complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 was the most frequent karyotype abnormality, occurring in 31% of the patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, other frequent anomalies were -7/del(7q)(13%), del(20q)(12%), del(5q)(9%), -18(5%), -21(5%), i(17q)(5%), -Y(4%), -17(4%), +21(4%), -13/del(13q)(4%), and -22(4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of poor karyotypes of IPSS was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBI</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBII</z:e> among the World Health Organization classifications than in subgroups with less than 5% blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up data were available for 310 patients with a median follow-up duration of 14.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 59 months for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and 26 months for those with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to IPSS cytogenetic categories, the median survivals of good-risk subgroup, intermediate-risk subgroup and poor-risk subgroup were 59, 43 and 12 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For IPSS-R cytogenetic groups, the median survivals of good-risk subgroup, intermediate-risk(int-risk) subgroup, poor-risk and very poor-risk subgroup were 59, 36, 15, and 10 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to G-A classification, the median survivals of good-risk subgroup, int-1-risk subgroup, int-2-risk subgroup and poor-risk subgroup were 59, 44, 15, and 11 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In frequent isolated karyotypic abnormalities, +8 had a median survival of 44 months, i(17q) had a median survival of 12 months, and -7/del(7q) had a median survival of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In comparison with IPSS and G-A categories, IPSS-R cytogenetic categories are more sophisticated, and can stratify prognosis effectively, but prognostic significances of some karyotypes in IPSS-R still need to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
