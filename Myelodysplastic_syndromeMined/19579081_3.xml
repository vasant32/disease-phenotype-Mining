<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PATIENTS: Twenty-four children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age of the patients was 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received a bone marrow graft and 4 an unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplant; 12 bone marrow grafts were from a matched related donor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) and 8 from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of chemotherapy alone in 17 patients (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> +/- melfalan) Seven patients received TBI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients died from transplant-related toxicity and 4 had relapse or disease progression post-AHSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients are alive and event-free with a median follow-up of 120 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EFS rate in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> group was 0.48 (SE 0.13) versus 0.25 (SE 0.12) in the MUD/UCB group (p = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lansky score in survivors is &gt;or=90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this historical series of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in spite of severe transplant-related toxicity, encouraging EFS outcomes have been achieved after AHSCT with good quality of life </plain></SENT>
