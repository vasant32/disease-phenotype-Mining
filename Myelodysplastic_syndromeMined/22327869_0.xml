<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to intrinsic genetic alterations, the effects of the extrinsic microenvironment also play a pathological role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of increased inflammatory cytokines, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α), in marrow and abnormal activation of the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells are associated with the ineffective hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism of p38 MAPK activation triggered by microenvironment cytokines remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we combined computational modeling analysis and molecular biology studies to perform a systematic investigation of signaling events regulated by microenvironment cytokines in hematopoietic cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined dynamic changes of key signaling events, including the p38 MAPK and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in bone marrow mononuclear cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors in response to TNF-α stimulation using reverse phase protein array technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed by a novel computational model and preliminarily validated by immunohistochemistry analysis of the bone marrow tissues from twelve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our systematic model revealed that the dynamic response patterns of p38 MAPK and JNK to TNF-α stimulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were different from that observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-X (BCL-XL) protein degradation was regulated by the JNK pathway in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, but by p38 MAPK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, BCL-XL was highly expressed in hematopoietic cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, but was minimally expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, immunostaining for phosphorylated p38 MAPKα showed much higher p38 MAPK activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows, supporting over-activation of p38 MAPK-enhanced degradation of BCL-XL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degradation of BCL-XL triggered by p38 MAPK over-activation may contribute to the increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of marrow cells, a phenomenon commonly observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and lead to ineffective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the combination of molecular biological studies and systematic modeling is a powerful tool for comprehensive investigation of the complex cellular mechanisms involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
