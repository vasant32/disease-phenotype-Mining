<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients the antileukemic therapy was a chemotherapy regimen that was highly active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ie, containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
