<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with hepatosplenic 33 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 35-year-old man was admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> but with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow on his first admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> but no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and was tentatively treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This treatment resulted in a transient improvement of the cytopenia and a reduction of spleen size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 10 months after the first manifestation, progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> became apparent, and a splenectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathologic findings for the spleen showed diffuse and disseminated infiltration of medium- to large-sized T-lymphocytes in the splenic red pulp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD16, CD56,T-cell receptor 33 (TCR33),T-cell intracellular antigen 1, and granzyme B but were negative for CD4, CD30, CD57, and TCR33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggested a diagnosis of hepatosplenic 33 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Southern blot analysis revealed gene rearrangement of the TCR 3-chain gene but not the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in the spleen cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An in situ hybridization analysis for the Epstein-Barr virus revealed negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient received 8 courses of combination chemotherapy and achieved a partial remission; however, the dysplastic features of the marrow cells persisted after the partial remission was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional treatment with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation resulted in a transient complete remission; however, the patient relapsed 11 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because he had experienced no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and showed dysplastic features in the bone marrow, the diagnosis was highly dependent on the pathologic findings for the resected spleen </plain></SENT>
