<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the dual CB/TPD-MHSC transplant strategy results in periods of post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, final rates of full donor chimerism and transplant-related mortality rates comparable to those of the RTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final survival outcomes are comparable in adults transplanted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, with different incidences of the complications that most influence these: a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> related to late recovery of protective immunity dependent on T cell functions, and a lower incidence of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in cord blood transplant techniques allow allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to be a viable option for almost every patient who may benefit from this therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of innovative strategies to improve the post-transplant recovery of T cells function is currently the main challenge to further improving the possibilities of unrelated cord blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
