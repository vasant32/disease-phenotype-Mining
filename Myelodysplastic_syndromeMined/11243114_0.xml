<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1 genes was examined in 31 MDS, 11 post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 34 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evi1 expression was not detected in 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but low MDS1-Evi1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi1/GAPDH &lt; 0.1) detected in 3 of the 8 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evi1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in 1 of 8 RA, 8 of 13 RAEB and 6 of 9 RAEB-t patients, and the percentage of Evi1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>(t) patients was higher than that in RA(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MDS1-Evi1 expression was detected in 5 of 8 RA, 9 of 13 RAEB and 5 of 9 RAEB-t patients, and MDS1-Evi1 expression levels (MDS1-Evi1/GAPDH &gt; 0.1) in the patients were markedly higher than those in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evi1 expression was gradually increased in 4 of 5 RAEB-t patients with transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of Evi-1 and MDS1-Evi1 expression in post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were higher than those in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of colony formation of progenitor cells in Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were decreased as compared with Evi1 and MDS1-Evi1-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of Evi1 and overexpression of MDS1-Evi1 might play a certain role in the pathogenesis or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and post <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
