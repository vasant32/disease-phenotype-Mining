<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was purposed to explore the effect and mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) on SKM-1 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and/or TSA on proliferation of SKM-1cells was analyzed with trypan blue exclusion; the differentiation of SKM-1 cells was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitro-blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) reduction and flow cytometry; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cells was measured by Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>; the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Fas, survivin and P15(INK4B) in cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and/or TSA was evaluated by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and/or TSA were capable of inhibiting SKM-1 cell growth and promoting cell differentiation; they stimulated the expression of CD14 and CD11b and inhibited HLA-DR expression; meanwhile and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> or/and TSA could induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, up-regulate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Fas and P15(INK4B), and down-regulate survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>/differentiation of SKM-1 cells, whose mechanisms may related to the expression of Fas, survivin and P15(INK4B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> has the synergistic effect with TSA </plain></SENT>
