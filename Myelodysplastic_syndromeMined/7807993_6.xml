<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> occurred in 3/1374 CLL patients seen at a single institution between 1972 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up exceeded 7 years and 72% of these patients had received prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expected number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> developing in a general population of the same size was 1.2 as calculated from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data (observed-to-expected ratio = 2.49; 95% confidence interval = 0.9-7.3; p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although, not included in the incidence calculation, four patients with CLL were referred at the time of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> were diagnosed concurrently in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients had received no prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 17 months in patients who had received no prior treatment, and 5 months in those who had received prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with CLL in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> develops have similar prognoses to other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this analysis does not provide evidence for a heightened risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> in CLL patients, despite treatment with known leukemogenic agents </plain></SENT>
