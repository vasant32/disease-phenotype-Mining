<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence and incidence of mild grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and to assess the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> types in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, population-based study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents 65 years or older in Biella, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood test results were available for analysis from 8,744 elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration decreased and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> increased steadily with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (defined as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration of 10.0-11.9 g/dL in women and 10.0-12.9 g/dL in men) affected 11.8% of the elderly included in the analysis, while the estimated prevalence in the entire population was 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> determination, most mildly anemic individuals perceived themselves as non-anemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0702157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia trait</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were the most frequent types of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> remained unexplained in 26.4% of the cases, almost one third of which might be accounted for by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a random sample of non-anemic elderly at baseline (n=529), after about 2 years, the annual incidence rate of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was 22.5 per 1000 person-years and increased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> increase with age and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> affects more than one out of ten elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is common and may be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in some cases </plain></SENT>
