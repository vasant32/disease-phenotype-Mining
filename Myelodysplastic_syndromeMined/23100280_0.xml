<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of microRNA-34b and CREB in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> has never been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined microRNA-34b expression and the methylation status of its promoter in cells from patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used gene expression profiling to identify signatures of myeloid transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We established that microRNA-34b has suppressor ability and that CREB has oncogenic potential in primary bone marrow cell cultures and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-34b was found to be up-regulated in pediatric patients with juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=17) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n=28), but was down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients at diagnosis (n=112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that hypermethylation of the microRNA-34b promoter occurred in 66% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> explaining the low microRNA-34b levels and CREB overexpression, whereas preleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were not associated with hypermethylation or CREB overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In paired samples taken from the same patients when they had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and again during the subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, we confirmed microRNA-34b promoter hypermethylation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, with 103 CREB target genes differentially expressed between the two disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This subset of CREB targets was confirmed to associate with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in a separate cohort of patients (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight of these 103 CREB targets were also differentially expressed between healthy samples (n=11) and de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n=72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, low microRNA-34b and high CREB expression levels induced aberrant myelopoiesis through CREB-dependent pathways in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we suggest that microRNA-34b controls CREB expression and contributes to myeloid transformation from both healthy bone marrow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We identified a subset of CREB target genes that represents a novel transcriptional network that may control myeloid transformation </plain></SENT>
