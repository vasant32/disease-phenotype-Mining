<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sapacitabine given orally twice daily for 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks, or twice daily for 3 days for 2 weeks (days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10) every 3 to 4 weeks, in refractory-relapse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 47 patients were treated in the phase I study that used a classical 3 + 3 design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sapacitabine was escalated from 75 to 375 mg twice daily for 7 days (n = 35) and from 375 to 475 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DLTs with both schedules were gastrointestinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MTDs were 375 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recommended phase II single-agent dose schedules were 325 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed in 13 patients (28%); four were complete responses, and nine were marrow complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sapacitabine is a new, safely administered, oral deoxycytidine analog that has encouraging activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
