<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because morphologic dyspoiesis may be subtle, and many cases have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics, additional objective diagnostic tools are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously developed a novel peripheral blood neutrophil flow-cytometric (FCM) scoring system to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, in an analysis of 25 patients, we demonstrate that FCM abnormalities are independent of currently measured parameters in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including cytopenias, marrow blast percent, and IPSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, FCM abnormalities were seen in 9/16 MDS patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics, suggesting that this simple, non-invasive assay could play a central role in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
