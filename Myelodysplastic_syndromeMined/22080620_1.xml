<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival of children =18 y, treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) using equine antithymocyte globulin (e-ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective data entry as per a specified format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: From January 1998 to December 2009, 40 children were diagnosed with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; 33 patients, who received IST, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>31 children (94%) received one course of e-ATG and CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 patients (6%) received two courses of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Immunosuppressive therapy using equine ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall response and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response (complete response + partial response) to IST at 6 months was 87.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8 (24.2%) patients achieved CR, 21 (63.6%) patients had PR and 4 (12.1%) patients did not respond to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 24 (6-102) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 24 months was 90%, with an actual survival of 85.4% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (51.5%) received G-CSF for a median duration of 32 (23-64) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients who received G-CSF had fewer infectious complications (P=0.002), but G-CSF administration did not influence survival/ outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients who respond to IST is excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Also, G-CSF reduces the infectious complications without conferring any survival advantage </plain></SENT>
