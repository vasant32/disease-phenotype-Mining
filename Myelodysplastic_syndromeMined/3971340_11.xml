<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serial cytogenetic studies were performed in 33 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in order to establish the frequency of karyotypic evolution and to correlate the chromosome and clinical findings during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 33 patients (45%) showed abnormalities in the first cytogenetic study and this percentage increased to 57% during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A stable karyotype (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal) was found in 19 patients (58%), whereas the rest (42%) showed an unstable karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and del5q were the most frequent abnormalities, not only at presentation, but also during karyotypic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (23%) with a known evolution proceeded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; four of them had stable (22%) and three unstable (25%) karyotypes; however, 33% of patients with unstable karyotypes and only 5% with stable karyotypes died from complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that karyotypic evolution is relatively frequent in these patients; this evolution could be related to a poor clinical prognosis, either evolving to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
