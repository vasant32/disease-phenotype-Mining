<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses were successfully performed in 2072 (97.6%) patients, revealing clonal abnormalities in 1084 (52.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numeric and structural chromosomal abnormalities were documented for each patient and subdivided further according to the number of additional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, 684 different cytogenetic categories were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of the karyotype on the natural course of the disease was studied in 1286 patients treated with supportive care only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 53.4 months for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes (n = 612) and 8.7 months for those with complex anomalies (n = 166) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 rare abnormalities were identified with good (+1/+1q, t(1q), t(7q), del(9q), del(12p), chromosome 15 anomalies, t(17q), <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 21, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, and -X), intermediate (del(11q), chromosome 19 anomalies), or poor (t(5q)) prognostic impact, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic relevance of additional abnormalities varied considerably depending on the chromosomes affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> World Health Organization (WHO) and French-American-British (FAB) classification system subtypes, the karyotype provided additional prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analyses offer new insights into the prognostic significance of rare chromosomal abnormalities and specific karyotypic combinations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
