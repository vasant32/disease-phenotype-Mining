<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with tMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are often referred for consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the outcomes of HSCT in such patients have not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women who were treated with HSCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at our institution between 1991 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the transplantation outcomes for 24 women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> with those for 271 women with de novo disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were 41 and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those outcomes were very similar to those of patients with de novo disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> had no impact on OS, DFS, relapse or NRM </plain></SENT>
