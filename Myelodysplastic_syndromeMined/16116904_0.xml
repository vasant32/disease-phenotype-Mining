<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The analysis of examination was made for 72 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the groups formed by number of blasts in BM, karyotype and IPSS variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was diagnosed by WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transformation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was established in blastosis &gt; 20% in peripheral blood and/or BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was studied according to GTG technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More frequent progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was seen in patients with blastosis &gt; 10%, unfavourable karyotype and high IPSS risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The least number of leukemic transformations occurred in karyotype of intermediate prognosis while disease-free survival in patients with karyotype of good prognosis was similar to that of patients with unfavourable karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of blasts in BM and IPSS variant appeared to be prognostic markers of duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival in one-factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multifactorial analysis found out one factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: number of blasts in BM puncture biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prognostic priority of the number of BM blasts as a risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression compared to karyotype is explained by biological heterogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
