<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are minimal data on the response of PRCA in this context to immunosuppression; in particular the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with PRCA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in whom CSA and low dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> led to restoration of marrow erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests indicated the PRCA was likely to be mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes rather than an inhibitory effect of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that CSA, due to its suppressive effect on cytotoxic T cell activity, is a rational therapy in this context </plain></SENT>
