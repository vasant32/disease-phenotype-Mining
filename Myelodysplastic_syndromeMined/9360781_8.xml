<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were treated by marrow transplantation from genotypically HLA-identical siblings (n = 92) or HLA haploidentical family members differing for one HLA antigen on the nonshared haplotype (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), they were administered postgrafting immunosuppression with a short course of intermittent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for no more than 11 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Customarily, we have given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for 180 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we asked whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> could be stopped earlier without affecting the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By day 60, patients who never had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, or whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD had resolved, were randomized to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> stopped (n = 52) or continued for the usual 180 days (n = 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed with a median follow-up of 9.3 years after transplant, and showed that patients in whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was discontinued on day 60 had a significantly more rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), but not a significantly higher overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD than those in whom the drug was stopped on day 180 (43 vs. 54%; p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality was comparable among patients without preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, regardless of when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was discontinued (11% for both study arms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, transplant-related mortality appeared to increase among patients with preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was stopped by day 60 (38 vs. 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> can safely be discontinued early in patients who never had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, while those with preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD would benefit from a longer course of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the relatively small sample sizes, these results would best be treated as promising preliminary findings that should be confirmed in larger randomized studies </plain></SENT>
