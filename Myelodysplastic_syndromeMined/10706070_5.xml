<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously reported on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of bone marrow stromal cell function in supporting hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro among <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, stromal cells from some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA patients induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism responsible for this action was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we established a cloned stromal cell line (LS801) from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA patient by introducing recombinant SV40-adenovirus vector containing the SV40 early gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LS801 induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and cloned leukemic cells in a coculture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When hematopoietic cells were cocultured but kept separate from LS801 by a 0.45-microm Millipore membrane to prevent their attachment, the action of LS801 in inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, no production of fas ligand, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha or interferon gamma in LS801 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the novel stromal cell line LS801 will shed light on research into the mechanism underlying the apoptotic changes induced by stromal cells in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
