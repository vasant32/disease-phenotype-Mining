<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied its expression and function in cluster of differentiation 34-positive (CD34(+)) primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD34(+) cells were differentiated into various myeloid lineages using the appropriate cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EVI1 expression was measured by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and intranuclear fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental manipulation of EVI1 levels was achieved using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EVI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and its variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 1 (MDS1)/EVI1, which gives rise to a partially antagonistic protein, were detectable in CD34(+) cells, but their levels declined rapidly during differentiation into the granulocyte, monocyte, dendritic, erythroid, and megakaryocyte lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, EVI1 protein levels decreased during myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attempts to experimentally express EVI1 in CD34(+) and U937 cells indicated that ectopic expression of EVI1 may cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and/or senescence of human hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EVI1 is expressed in human hematopoietic progenitor cells, but is down-regulated during differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of EVI1 may activate cellular safeguards against oncogene activation </plain></SENT>
