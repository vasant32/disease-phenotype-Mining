<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of choice for young patients is bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This report describes the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in two patients with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for whom no suitable bone marrow donors were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients had no human lymphocyte antigen-identical siblings and no suitable matched unrelated donor could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or a combination of the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CsA, ATG, or the combination led to clinical improvement (resolution of transfusion requirement), increase of bone marrow cellularity, and the disappearance of dysplastic characteristics in the two patients with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of recurrence, this disease was still responsive to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ATG and CsA can be an attractive alternative for patients with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for whom there is no possibility of bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
