<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by allogeneic BMT, for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven were transplanted for ALL in second remission (CR2), and 16 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission (CR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 22 were high risk patients: six were transplanted for ALL in third remission (CR3), two for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in CR2, two for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 12 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in relapse </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimum follow-up is 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and the actuarial relapse rate is 59 and 14% for patients with ALL in second remission, and 38 and 14+% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients have relapsed (three are alive in remission after testicular or marrow relapse) and 28 have died of other causes </plain></SENT>
