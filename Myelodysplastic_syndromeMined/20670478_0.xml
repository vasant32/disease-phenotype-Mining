<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cure rate of 75-80% can be anticipated with a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Tunisia, the ATRA era began in 1998 with the use, consecutively, of two regimens of a combination of ATRA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (APL93), and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (LPA99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 2004, 39 patients with confirmed APL either by t(15;17) or PML/RARA were treated by the PETHEMA <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> 99 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rationale of this protocol by avoiding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in complete remission (CR) without increasing the incidence of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients achieved CR (84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients were considered as failure due to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: three caused by differentiation syndrome (DS) and three died from central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood cell count (WBC) &gt;10 x 10(9)/l (P=0.26) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;1.4 mg/dl (P=0.42) were not predictive of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DS was observed in 11 patients (30.5%) with a median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time of 12 days (range: 3-23 days) and median WBC of 29 x 10(9)/L (range: 1.2 x 10(9)-82.7 x 10(9)/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DS was severe in seven cases, moderate in four, and fatal in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body mass index &gt; or =30 (P=0.044) and baseline WBC &gt; or =20 x 10(9)/l (P=0.025) are independent predictors of DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of this study is 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients are alive in continuous complete remission; two patients died in CR from septic shock and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> respectively; one patient died 47 months after achieving two relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Event free survival from diagnosis was 80% and overall survival was 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results are quite acceptable and can be improved by reducing mortality rate </plain></SENT>
