<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA), and therapy with subcutaneous S-CSF (100 micrograms/day) was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His leukocyte count increased from 800/microliters to 1,400/microliters in two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of G-CSF was raised to 200 micrograms/day in the third week, and leukocytes increased to 2,00/microliters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the fifth week, intravenous EPO (6,000 U x 3 times/week) was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His leukocyte count increased to 4,000/microliters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPO therapy was raised to 12,000 U x 3 times/week at the eighth week, his leukocyte count remained at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G-CSF and EPO was stopped at the eleventh week, and leukocytes decreased to the same level as before administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Throughout the course, his platelet count and reticulocyte count did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-CSF and EPO are known as the stimulators of granuriod and erythroid progenitor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in this case, combination therapy with G-CSF and EPO induced marked increase of granulocytes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was an interesting case in relation to the roles of these cytokines in the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
