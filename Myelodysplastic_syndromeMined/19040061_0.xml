<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The consecutive samples of 435 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Sino-US Shanghai <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Cooperative Group were collected prospectively and diagnosed with WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed using chromosome G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age in the patients was 58 (18-90) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cases with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) was highest ,accounting for 69.6% (303/435) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other subtypes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) 24.1% (105/435), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) 2.3% (10/435), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, unclassifiable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e>) 2.3% (10/435), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) 1.2% (5/435) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> 0.5% (2/435) in turn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of RA, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> were higher in western countries and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> subtype was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases had failure of chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 424 cases with success the frequency of chromosome abnormality was 38.7%, with the highest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB- I</z:e> (62.5%), and then <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> (48.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (34.5%) in turn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequence of common chromosome abnormalities was + 8 (12.7% ), complex karyotype (9.0%), chromosome translocation (7.8%), - 20q (6.6%), -7/-7q (5.2%), -5/-5q (4.2%) and- Y(2.4%), while the sequential order in western countries -5/-5q, -7/-7q, +8, 11q and 12p/12q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chromosome prognosis was grouped according to International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS), 289 cases were in the group with good chromosome prognosis (68.2%), 81 cases in group with medium prognosis (19.1%) and 54 cases in group with poor prognosis (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome examination because of lower percentage of abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the detection sensitivity of abnormality with FISH may sometimes be high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The WHO subtype and chromosome abnormality distributions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Shanghai were different from those in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The combination of FISH and conventional chromosome examination could improve the detection sensitivity </plain></SENT>
