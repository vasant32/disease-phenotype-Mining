<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epoetin alfa 40,000 IU was given subcutaneously twice weekly; after 4 weeks, the dose could be reduced to 40,000 IU weekly in patients achieving erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QOL was assessed using the functional assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FACT-An) questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FACT-An scores increased on average by 7.5 after 4 weeks and by 8.8 after 8 weeks compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FACT-An scores were positively associated with Hb values (r=0.53, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean FACT-An score increase at week 8 was 10.2 in responders and 5.6 in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall erythroid response rate at week 8 was 68%: 74% in transfusion-independent patients and 59% in transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responders at week 8, response was maintained in 86% at week 12, 71% at week 16, 65% at week 20, and 54% at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data provide new and encouraging results regarding the benefits of 40,000 IU biweekly induction doses followed by 40,000 IU weekly in improving QOL, correcting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and reducing transfusion requirements in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
