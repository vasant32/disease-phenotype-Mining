<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we initiated a phase II trial designed to determine response, toxicity, and dose intensity using this regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 74 patients with advanced-stage (III or IV) or bulky stage II aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall complete response rate was 69% (72% in evaluable patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the median survival has not yet been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 4-year survival rate is 73% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62, 83%) and no difference was observed among International Prognostic Index (IPI) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4-year disease-free survival was 71% (95% CI 58, 84%) with no statistical difference between patients with IPI 0 to 1 versus 2 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The toxicity was acceptable, though the grade 4 hematologic toxicity rate for this regimen was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three cases of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> occurred at 7 months, 3.4 years, and 4.2 years after registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenic analysis was available in two cases, showing inv(16) without French American British classification (FAB) M4 EO histology in one patient and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that 200% ProMACE-CytaBOM with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF results in a high complete remission rate and a disease-free survival comparable to any prior risk-based analysis in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Before using this regimen in general practice, phase III clinical trials should be conducted </plain></SENT>
