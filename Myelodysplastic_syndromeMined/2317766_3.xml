<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 64 harvests on 26 cryopreserved samples from 20 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome quality was best in the samples from patients with myeloid disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful chromosome studies of approximately 50% of the samples were accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryopreservation of leukemic cells is not a substitute for fresh material because the method produces relatively few metaphases and mediocre chromosome spreading and banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when rigid and appropriate research objectives are applied, chromosome analysis of cryopreserved leukemic cells can be a viable alternative to analysis of fresh cells </plain></SENT>
