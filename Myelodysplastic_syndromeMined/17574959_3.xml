<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 110 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> were recruited based on the presence of chromosome 5 abnormalities under conventional cytogenetics and supplemented by a systematic fluorescence in situ hybridization study of chromosomes 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) were deletions of various sizes and sometimes cryptic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5q abnormalities were associated with translocations in 54% of cases and were simple deletions in 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 68% of cases, 5q deletions were associated with chromosome 7 abnormalities, and 90% of these presented a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 110 patients, 28 had a hematopoietic disorder secondary to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 82 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, 63 were older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities often associated hypodiploidy and chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities in complex karyotypes, features resembling those of secondary hemopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systematic investigation of the exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> and oncogenes is thus essential to specify the factors potentially involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with 5q abnormalities </plain></SENT>
