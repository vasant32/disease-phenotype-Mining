<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the vast majority of patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> (SM), the bone marrow is the primary extracutaneous site of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to bone marrow involvement, other visceral organs such as the spleen, liver or the gastrointestinal tract, may also be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, isolated involvement of a single extramedullary organ is rarely seen in SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on two patients with SM with splenic involvement, lack of 'diagnostic' mast cell (MC) infiltrates in the bone marrow, and absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was diagnosed prior to the detection of SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients presented with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and multifocal MC infiltrates in splenic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These MCs also expressed CD25 as well as the C-KIT mutation D816V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In consecutive examinations, the mutation was also detected in the bone marrow in both patients suggesting diffuse infiltration with neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data show that the spleen can be a primary site of disease in rare cases of SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>Mastocytosis</z:hpo> should therefore be considered as a (rare) differential diagnosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
