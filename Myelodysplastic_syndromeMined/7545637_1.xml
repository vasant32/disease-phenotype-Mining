<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 72-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts who presented severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment over a 6-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to a dramatic increase in mature neutrophils, platelet count and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, the patient achieved a hematological remission which continued for more than 5 months despite discontinuation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This observation confirms that in some cases during G-CSF treatment erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis may improve in addition to the expected effect on neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the patient remained in hematological remission, bone marrow examination revealed trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the hematological remission in this patient may not have resulted from a recovery of non-clonal hematopoiesis of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clone, but may have derived instead from the monoclonal hematopoiesis of a neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
