<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the potential association between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid disorders (CMDs), including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who had received diagnoses of both CMD and PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a known cause of PH were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a CMD was based on established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of PH was based on echocardiographic data or right heart catheterization data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients satisfied the criteria for both a CMD and PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MMM), 5 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET), 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, 2 patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (92%) received treatment for their CMDs, which included therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (18 patients), anagrelide (7 patients), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PH was diagnosed a median of 8 years after recognition of the CMD (range, 0 to 26 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median right ventricular systolic pressure (RVsys) was 71 mm Hg (range, 32 to 105 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RVsys correlated with the platelet count in patients with MMM (r = 0.30) and ET (r = 0.6) and with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> (r = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of CMD did not seem to affect the severity of the pulmonary artery pressures as measured by serial echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With a median survival time of 18 months after the diagnosis of PH, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the majority of the patients was cardiopulmonary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests a higher than expected incidence of PH in patients with MMM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, and ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prognosis in such a setting is poor and may not be influenced by aggressive treatment of the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
