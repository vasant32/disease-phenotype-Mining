<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 181 consecutive patients who underwent MUD-PBSC transplantation at the City of Hope between August 2000 to December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were conditioned with either full-intensity regimen or reduced-intensity regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse relationship between higher CD34(+) cell dose and faster neutrophil engraftment (r = -0.16, P = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, a CD34(+) cell dose &gt; or =4.2 x 10(6)/kg (above the lowest quartile) was associated with significantly lower relapse risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67, P = .0126), with a trend for corresponding improvement for disease-free survival (HR = 0.84, P = .12) but not overall survival (HR = 0.91, P = .46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of the CD34(+) cell dose remained significant in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher CD34(+) cell dose was significantly associated with faster recovery of absolute lymphocyte counts on day +30 posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subset analysis demonstrated that the higher CD34(+) cell dose was associated with (1) greater reduction in relapse in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> than that in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, (2) greater reduction in reduced-intensity conditioning than in full-intensity conditioning, (3) greater reduction in relapse when there is a inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand (iKIRL)-mismatch in the gravft-versus-host (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>) direction, and (4) greater reduction in relapse when there is a lack of iKIRL, suggesting that the protective effect of CD34(+) cell dose against relapse may be immune-mediated, possibly through NK cell recovery </plain></SENT>
