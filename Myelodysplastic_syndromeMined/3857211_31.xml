<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective series of patients with the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> has been reviewed and the survival updated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A scoring system is proposed that has advantages in predicting survival outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The importance of either dysmegakaryocytopoiesis or dysgranulocytopoiesis is emphasized because of its prognostic impact on leukaemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 50 per cent of the patients die from either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or consequences of defective marrow production of granulocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although only a few cases were included, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> group has a very poor outcome and appears much closer to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026999" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M2</z:e> in biologic behaviour than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the criteria for the FAB subtypes and the scoring system can be applied easily in each case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 patients only 9 were still alive as of April, 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of these were in the RA-S and RA categories (or using the scoring system grouping 7 were group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 16 patients who progressed to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> died within 4 weeks, and none was treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 31 patients, half died as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and/or haemorrhage and the remainder from apparently unrelated causes (cardiovascular, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These latter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are not surprising in light of the median age of 72 years </plain></SENT>
