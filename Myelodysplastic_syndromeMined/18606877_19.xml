<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FCSS scores were retrospectively compared with patient outcomes in both univariate and multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of posttransplantation relapse at 3 years was 15%, 10%, and 36% for patients with mild, moderate, and severe FCSS scores, respectively, with the hazard for relapse of 2.8 (P = .02) for severe scores in comparison to patients with mild or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FCSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the FCSS score was associated with relapse even after accounting for International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score or for marrow myeloblast percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with intermediate-1 risk by IPSS, severe FCSS scores were associated with an increased hazard of relapse (3.8; P = .02) compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/mild/moderate FCSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with less than 5% marrow myeloblasts, myeloblast dyspoiesis was associated with an increased hazard of relapse (3.7; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis confirmed that FCSS scores are predictive of posttransplantation outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> even after adjusting for risk factors such as marrow myeloblast percentage and IPSS score </plain></SENT>
