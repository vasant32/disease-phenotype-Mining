<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The laboratory parameters at diagnosis of 152 MDS patients with less than 0.05 bone marrow blasts and 86 CAA patients were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CAA in Hb, red cell distribution width-coefficient variation (RDW-CV), immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), BPC, the ratio of G1 (the sum percentage of myeloblast and promyelocyte) to G2 (the sum percentage of neutrophilic myelocyte and metamyelocyte) (Ratio G), the ratio of El (the sum percentage of proerythroblast and early erythroblast) to E2 (the sum percentage of intermediate erythroblast and late erythroblast) (Ratio E), megakaryocyte count (Meg), erythroblast <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (N-ALP), and serous levels of indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (IBIL), <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (FA), VitB12 and ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities were found in 74 MDS patients (48.7%) but in none of CAA patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, for differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with less than 0.05 blasts from CAA, the sensitivity and specificity of combination of Meg, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, and IBIL level was 89.1% and 92.7%, the Youden index (gamma) was 0.818 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the seven hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, BPC, myeloblast percentage, Ratio G, Meg, erythroblast <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> and FA were statistically different from those of CAA; the sensitivity and specificity of combination of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> and BPC was 85.7% and 100%, the gamma was 0.857; the sensitivity and specificity combination of Ratio G, Meg <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> was 85.7% and 98.8% respectively, the gamma was 0.845 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The routine laboratory parameters, especially BPC, Meg, Ratio G, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, IBIL may be helpful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and differential diagnosis of hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from CAA </plain></SENT>
