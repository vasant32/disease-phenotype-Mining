<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were obtained from peripheral blood of the patient when he lost multiple point mutations of ras genes with acquisition of chromosomal abnormalities during disease progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells grew as a single floating cell, and have been continuously growing with the morphological characteristics of immature monoblasts by serial passages during the past 42 months with a doubling time of about 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By cytochemical analysis, the cloned cells were positive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> esterase, but negative for the Epstein-Barr virus associated nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic analysis revealed the expression of myelomonocyte specific antigens such as CD4, CD13, CD33 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells from the primary peripheral blood and those from 50 passages of the SKM-1 cell line both possessed no activated ras genes but showed karyotype abnormalities with 46,XY, del(9)(q13;q22), der(17) t(17;?)(p13;?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SKM-1 cells have two mutations in p53 gene and overexpress the p53 products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This cell line may contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms in the progression from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
