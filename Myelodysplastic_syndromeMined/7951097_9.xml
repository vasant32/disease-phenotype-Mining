<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This complication is of uncertain significance and has not been reported after treatment protocols which do not contain TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY), instead of TBI, as the preparative regimen for allogeneic BMT to study the incidence and relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) of post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five consecutive patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 16 mg/kg and CY 120 mg/kg for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received non-T cell-depleted, HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor marrow 2 days after chemotherapy was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CYA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> were given to prevent GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients surviving 100 days post-transplant were evaluated; 11 (28%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (defined as an absolute eosinophil count of &gt; 500 x 10(6)) after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients were still taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> 5 of these 11 patients (45%) and GVHD that worsened within 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the other 6 patients (55%), GVHD was not present initially but developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients at a median of 4 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> can complicate allogeneic BMT not preceded by TBI and that it often heralds the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of worsening of, or de novo, GVHD </plain></SENT>
