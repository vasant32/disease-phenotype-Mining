<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> occurs is not well understood, it has been noted that the clinical and radiological characteristics of cyclosporin neurotoxicity, which may occur even when the blood levels of the drugs are within the therapeutic range, are very similar to those of hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and also resolve when the blood pressure drops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE CLINIC: A 35 year old woman, treated with high doses of cyclosporin for a bone marrow transplant, presented with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> which coincided with a rapid rise in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment full recovery (of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuro-radiological studies showed extensive changes in the white matter, mainly in the posterior cerebral regions that were not enhanced after contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes were compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance study done two years later was completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical report the aetiology and the clinical and radiological characteristics of the neurotoxicity due to cyclosporin are discussed </plain></SENT>
