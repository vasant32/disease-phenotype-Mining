<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble transferrin receptor (TfR) and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) were also assayed in order to evaluate erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were stratified for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> treatment as follows: 12 untreated anemic patients; 17 anemic patients during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy; 14 non-anemic patients without any treatment (&gt; 1 year); and 10 non-anemic patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although EPO levels in non-anemic patients were significantly higher than in healthy controls (n = 29) no statistically significant differences in Hb and EPO values were found between non-anemic patients receiving or not <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the linear regression analysis between Hb and log EPO concentration, no statistically significant differences in the slopes between untreated and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>-treated anemic groups nor between both groups and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (n = 23) were observed </plain></SENT>
