<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed the incidence and prognostic significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at diagnosis in 2565 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients included in the Spanish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (platelet count &lt;100 × 10(9) /L) was identified in 842 patients (32.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (platelet count &lt;30 × 10(9) /L) was observed in 7.1% of patients and was significantly associated with a higher-risk World Health Organization subtype (P = .026) and intermediate-2/high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score (P = .046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was the most important prognostic factor and had negative effects on the low/intermediate-1 risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival of patients with a platelet count &lt;30 and ≥ 30 × 10(9) /L was 16 months and 71 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 4.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.74-7.90; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The negative effect of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in low/intermediate-1 risk patients was caused by increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low/intermediate-1 IPSS risk score and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> should no longer be regarded as low risk, and must be considered for disease-altering approaches at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
