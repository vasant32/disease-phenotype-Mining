<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 46-year-old man suffering from angiocentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, he had atypical cells rich in basophilic granules in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e> and bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after diagnosis, the patient was treated with multidrug combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At first, the chemotherapy markedly relieved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> and bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and atypical cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood disappeared rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the disease gradually became resistant to chemotherapy, resulting in a gradual deterioration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> and bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and reappearance of atypical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-6, and of soluble interleukin-2 receptor correlated well with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells directly or indirectly induce the production of these cytokines and that a dysregulated cytokine network, which might be caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, induces an increase in atypical cells </plain></SENT>
