<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the possibility of generating and expanding in vitro CTL directed toward different types of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or myelodysplastic cells, using both HLA-matched and partially matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven donor/recipient pairs were enrolled; donor-derived dendritic cells, pulsed with patient blast cells, were used to generate CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> CTL lines were successfully obtained from 10 of 11 donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After repeated rounds of stimulation, CTL lines showed, along with an increase in cytotoxic activity, a variable but continuous expansion of cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to increase the magnitude of CTL expansion, two anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> CTL lines were further stimulated using allogeneic feeder cells, anti-CD3, and low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This stimulation gave rise to 150-fold to 270-fold expansion of the absolute number of cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most cultures showed either absent or low reactivity of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> CTL against patient non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> CTL lines displayed a more pronounced cytotoxicity against nonmalignant recipient cells, which was always lower than that observed against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts (LB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spectratyping analysis of the TCR-Vbeta subfamilies revealed a preferential expansion of oligoclonal populations that persisted in CTL lines following repeated rounds of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results provide the biological background for designing protocols of adoptive immunotherapy for the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> given HSCT </plain></SENT>
