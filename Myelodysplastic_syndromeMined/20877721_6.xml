<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: NPM1 gene at chromosome 5q35 is involved in recurrent translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It also undergoes mutations in 60% of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence and significance of NPM1 deletion in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bone marrow samples from 145 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically 43 cases had isolated 5q-, 84 cases had 5q- plus other changes and 18 cases had complex karyotype without 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH and direct sequencing investigated the NPM1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NPM1 deletion was an uncommon event in the "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>" but occurred in over 40% of cases with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with complex karyotypes and 5q loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It originated from large 5q chromosome deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous exon 12 mutations were never found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NPM1 gene status was related to the pattern of complex cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NPM1 haploinsufficiency was significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> (p&lt;0.001) and gross chromosomal rearrangements, i.e., markers, rings, and double minutes (p&lt;0.001), while NPM1 disomy was associated with structural changes (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in complex karyotypes with 5q- TP53 deletion and/or mutations are not specifically associated with NPM1 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: NPM1/5q35 deletion is a consistent event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a 5q-/-5 in complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NPM1 deletion and NPM1 exon 12 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive and are associated with two distinct cytogenetic subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
