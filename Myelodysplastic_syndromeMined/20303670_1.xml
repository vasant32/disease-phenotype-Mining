<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> as a function of radiation dose, taking into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> radiation dose distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed a case-control study that investigated the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> in childhood; it included 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> matched with 196 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete clinical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy histories were recorded for each patient in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average radiation dose to each of seven bone marrow components for each patient was incorporated into the models, and corresponding risks were summed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate risk parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whatever the model, we failed to evidence a role for the radiation dose to active bone marrow in the risk of later <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, or myeloproliferative syndrome, when adjusting for epipodophyllotoxin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result was confirmed when fitting models that included total dose of radiation delivered during radiotherapy, when fitting models taking into account dose per fraction, and when restricting the analysis to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to results found in similar studies that included children treated before the use of epipodophyllotoxins, this study failed to show a role for radiotherapy in the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> in children treated between 1980 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy was probably due to a competitive mechanism between these two carcinogens </plain></SENT>
