<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare the prognostic value of scoring systems in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (pMDS), four clinicohematological systems (Rennes, Bournemouth, Düsseldorf, Pavia) and the histopathological Hannover Scoring System were applied to 415 MDS patients from the Bone Marrow Registry of Hannover Medical School </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the FAB classification, 180 patients (43%) were diagnosed as RA, 33 (8%) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 99 (24%) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 36 (9%) as RAEBt, and 48 (12%) as CMMOL; 19 patients (4%) were not further classified (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>.UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scoring systems revealed three or four groups of patients with significantly different survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ranges and standard deviations in these groups were similar but high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good differentiation between short-term survivors (&lt; 1 year survival time) and intermediate-term survivors (1-4 years) was possible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested scoring systems, but the differentiation between intermediate- and long-term survivors (&gt; 4 years) was not distinctive enough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The problem of risk assessment in the single patient is furthermore elucidated by the values of specificity and sensitivity, which were relatively low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scoring systems tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Best results were yielded by the Bournemouth Score for long-term survivors and the Düsseldorf and Hannover Score for intermediate- and short-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters used in the scoring systems showed the highest negative impact on survival for increase of myeloblasts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, high age of the patient, and abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the histopathological Hannover Scoring System is not only equal to clinicohematological risk assessment in pMDS, but also includes important independent prognostic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment for the individual low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient using only initial parameters may be rendered impossible due to the biological nature of pMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, sequential analysis is needed to elucidate random events which alter the prognosis </plain></SENT>
