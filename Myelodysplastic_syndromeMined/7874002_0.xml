<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These doses and schedules of Ara-C yield plasma Ara-C concentrations in the range of 10 to 100 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utilizing concentrations and a schedule of Ara-C treatment, representative of Ara-C exposures in these clinical situations, we performed in vitro studies to examine the effects of co-treatment with pIXY 321 on Ara-C induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Ara-C-mediated colony growth inhibition of human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, higher percentage of morphologically recognizable apoptotic cells and increased colony growth inhibition were observed following treatment with 100 versus 10 nM Ara-C for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous exposure to 10 ng/ml pIXY 321 resulted in significantly increased colony growth inhibition as well as DNA fragmentation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> due to 10 nM but not 100 nM Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These concentrations of Ara-C inhibited c-myc and did not induce c-jun <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects of Ara-C on c-myc and c-jun expressions were not influenced by co-treatment with pIXY 321 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither treatment with pIXY 321 or Ara-C alone, nor co-treatment with pIXY 321 and Ara-C, significantly altered the intracellular p26BCL-2 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that co-treatment with pIXY 321 significantly increases low dose Ara-C-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and thereby its antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
