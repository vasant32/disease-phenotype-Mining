<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such transformations mostly occur in patients treated with radiophosphorous ((32)P) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, concern has also arisen about the long-term safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pipobroman (PI), a well tolerated and simple to use drug, constitutes a valid alternative to those cytoreductive treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study reports on 155 ET patients treated at our institution from 1985 to 1995, and monitored until December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A good control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> was achieved with PI as the only treatment in 106 patients and with HU in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 104 months, seven patients (four treated with HU, and three with PI) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> whereas one patient treated with PI developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in progression-free survival was observed between HU- and PI-treated patients (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A short-arm deletion of chromosome 17 was most frequently detected in HU-treated patients, while a long-arm <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 1 and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7q were seen in PI-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No TP53 mutation was discovered in the six patients studied (two HU-treated and four PI-treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these cytogenetic abnormalities are not linked to the natural history of the disease, but rather that they might be induced by the cytoreductive treatment </plain></SENT>
