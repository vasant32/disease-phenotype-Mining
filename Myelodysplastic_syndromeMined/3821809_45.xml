<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in these patients increases with time after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the occurrence of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> among 192 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> who were followed for a median of over 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We originally planned to identify prospectively the morphologic changes in bone marrow that precede the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 63 patients consenting to bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and no case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> occurred more than 11 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial analysis revealed that the peak <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-related complications was between three and nine years after first treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there appears to be a period of increased risk in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation, after which the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients surviving for more than 11 years after treatment appear to be at no increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
