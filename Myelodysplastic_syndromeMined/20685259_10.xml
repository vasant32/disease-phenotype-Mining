<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients were considered at high risk for relapse or nonrelapse mortality (NRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received intravenous treosulfan, 12 g/m(2)/day (n = 5) or 14 g/m(2)/day (n = 55) on days -6 to -4, and Flu (30 mg/m(2)/day) on days -6 to -2, followed by infusion of marrow (n = 7) or peripheral blood stem cells (n = 53) from HLA-identical siblings (n = 30) or unrelated donors (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NRM was 5% at day 100, and 8% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 58% and 88% for patients without high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 33% (15% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 34% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission, 50% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or ALL beyond first remission and 63% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in refractory relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a treosulfan/Flu regimen was well tolerated and yielded encouraging survival and disease control with minimal NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further trials are warranted to compare treosulfan/Flu to other widely used regimens, and to study the impact of using this regimen in more narrowly defined groups of patients </plain></SENT>
