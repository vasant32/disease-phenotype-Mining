<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Troxacitabine has significant activity in patients with refractory myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, both as a single agent and when combined with standard anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 170 patients with refractory myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> treated with troxacitabine-based regimens on Phase 1 or 2 studies, 10 (6%) had biopsy-proven extramedullary disease, either with or without bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients who received single-agent troxacitabine, 4 received a combination of troxacitabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
