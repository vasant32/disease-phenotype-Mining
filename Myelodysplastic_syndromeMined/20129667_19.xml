<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed, by multivariate analysis, survival and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 97 low or intermediate 1 IPSS patients regularly transfused as outpatients, chelated or not, who were included during a month period and followed for 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 44 (45%) of patients were not chelated and 53 (55%) received CT, mainly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, for at least 6 months (median duration of chelation 36 months, range 6-131+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 66 of the 97 patients died, including 51% and 73% of chelated and non-chelated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 53 months and 124 months in non-chelated and in chelated patients (p&lt;0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not significantly differ between the two groups (p=0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox analysis, adequate chelation was the strongest independent factor associated with better OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Iron chelation therapy appears to improve survival in heavily transfused lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but prospective randomized studies are required to confirm our findings, and to determine more precisely the mechanisms of this potential survival benefit </plain></SENT>
