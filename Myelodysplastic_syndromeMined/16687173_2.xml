<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unbalanced structural aberrations, leading to a gain or loss of chromosomal material, were frequently observed in bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients (81.1%) loss or rearrangement of chromosome 5, 7 and/or 11 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent numerical change was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as expected (detected in six patients-16.2%) and the most frequent breakpoints 5q13, 5q33, 7q31, 10p12, 11q23, 12p13, 17p11 and 21q22 were determined </plain></SENT>
