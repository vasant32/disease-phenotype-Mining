<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase I study, we investigated the toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics, and activity of a prolonged continuous infusion schedule of the colloidal dispersion formulation of 9-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> (9-AC/CD) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BP) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria were age greater than 15 years, performance status of 2 or better, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt; 1.5 mg/dl, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> &lt; 1.5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>9-AC/CD was given as a continuous intravenous infusion over seven days every three to four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The starting dose was 0.2 mg/m2/d (1.4 mg/m2/course) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Courses were given every three to four weeks according to toxicity and anti leukemic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phase I study used the classical 3 + 3 design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dose was escalated by 50% until grade I toxicity was observed, and then by 30% to 35% until the dose limiting toxicity was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), 8 to 10 patients were planned to be treated to better define the toxicity and early-activity profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> thirty-six patients; ALL two patients; <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BP one patient), median age 56 years, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe mucositis was the dose limiting toxicity; it occurred in three of six patients treated at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MTD was defined as 1.4 mg/m2/day by the phase I design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upon expansion of the number of patients, 3 of 10 patients had grade 4 mucositis and 1 of 10 patients had grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>Nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No complete or partial remission was observed in 37 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, 9-AC/CD exhibited antileukemic activity, as reflected by the finding of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> on day 14 in 46% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Average steady-state concentration of 9-AC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> was close to 10 nmol/l, and the of 9-AC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> area under curve (AUC) was 1409 +/- 705 nmol/l. hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MTD of 9-AC/CD given as a seven-day continuous infusion was 1.4 mg/m2/d (9.8 mg/m2/course) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This represents three to fourfold dose escalation compared with the MTD of 9-AC given as shorter continuous infusion (three days) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Future studies will determine the activity of prolonged administration of 9-AC/CD in patients with better prognosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
