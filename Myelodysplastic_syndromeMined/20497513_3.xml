<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For HLA-alloimmunized patients, platelet (PLT) concentrations are provided either at matched HLA-A and HLA-B loci or by serologic cross-reactivity groups (CREG) matching strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this method has some limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-based matching (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>) method was evaluated for selecting proper HLA-typed PLTs for patients with PLT transfusion refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bead-based single-antigen HLA antibody detection method and HLAMatchmaker software were used to define the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by HLA-specific antibodies and to select compatible PLTs for nine patients with alloimmunized refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corrected count increments (CCIs) were prospectively determined to compare successful transfusion rates among different matching methods in 142 PLT transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA antibodies were serially detected to see whether any emerging antibodies appeared after receiving the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>-matched PLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transfusion success rates evaluated with 1-hour CCIs for perfect matching or lacking any mismatching at HLA-A and -B locus (A/BU)-matched, CREG-matched, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>-matched PLTs were 85.2, 63.2, and 83.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to CREG-matched PLTs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>-matched PLTs showed better transfusion results (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study (7 months; range, 3-13 months), no emerging HLA-specific antibodies were detected after receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>-matched PLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e> performed on the basis of bead-based single-antigen HLA antibody detection coupled with the HLAMatchmaker program is recommended in choosing proper PLTs for refractory patients when A/BU-matched PLTs were not available </plain></SENT>
