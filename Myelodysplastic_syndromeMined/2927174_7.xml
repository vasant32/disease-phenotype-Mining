<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypogranulation was measure both as the percentage of agranular neutrophils and as a score value, taking into account also cells with slight or moderate hypogranulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 62 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo>, 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison we studied 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 18 patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reference values were defined as the 95% probability limit of the mean values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 52/62 patients (84%) had increased numbers of pelgeroid cells, 40/62 (65%) had abnormal granulation scores while only 14/62 (23%) had increased percentages of agranular neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean granulation score (+/- S.D.) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (225.0 +/- 57.4), was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (282.7 +/- 9.0), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> (288.8 +/- 8.0) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (281.7 +/- 12.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pelgeroid neutrophils were significantly (p less than 0.001) more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (11.6% +/- 7.8) compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (1.1% +/- 1.0), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> (3.1% +/- 2.0) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (1.9% +/- 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the degree of hypogranulation and the percentages of pelgeroid cells in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypogranulation tended to be more pronounced in the more immature forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> while pelgeroid cells were equally common in the different subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the two parameters were combined peripheral blood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was recognized in 92% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that quantitative estimation of hypogranulation and of nuclear abnormalities in peripheral blood polymorphs are simple and valuable diagnostic tools in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
