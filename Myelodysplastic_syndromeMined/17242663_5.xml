<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide versus best supportive care (BSC) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a decision analytic model to compare costs and outcomes of lenalidomide with BSC without recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) versus BSC with EPO over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were transfusion independence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model incorporated costs of medications, transfusions, chelation, laboratory tests, office visits, and other resources associated with each therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide therapy was associated with an estimated incremental 0.53 transfusion-free and 0.25 QALY gain compared to BSC at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The costs of lenalidomide therapy were substantially offset by reduced blood transfusion and EPO costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-year total treatment costs were estimated at $63,385 for lenalidomide and $54,940 for BSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for lenalidomide vs BSC was estimated at $16,066 per transfusion-free year and $35,050 per QALY gained, values within the acceptable cost-effectiveness ranges for a new therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that oral lenalidomide is cost effective in the United States in the treatment of transfusion-dependent, low- or intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these findings awaits results of an ongoing randomized phase III trial (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-004 study) </plain></SENT>
