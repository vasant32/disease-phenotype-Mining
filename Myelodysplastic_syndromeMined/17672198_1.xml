<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare the level of moistening of the oral mucosa with the rate of secretion of the stimulated and non-stimulated saliva at various times after the patient underwent the bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study involved 46 patients 18 women and 28 men, aged 19 to 54 (mean 38.3 +/- 10.5 years), between 100 days and 6 years following the HSCT (mean 18.7 +/- 15.7 months) </plain></SENT>
