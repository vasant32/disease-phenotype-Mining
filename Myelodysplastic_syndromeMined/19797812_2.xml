<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is more in older age groups and frequent chromosome abnormalities reported to be <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the data on cytogenetic changes in Indian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was therefore undertaken to study the aetiology and frequency of chromosomal changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, attending a tertiary care hospital in Maharashtra, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out in 145 MDS patients for six years (2001-2006) at National Institute of Immunohaematology (ICMR), and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were diagnosed according to FAB and WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic study was carried out using GTG-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done with Chi(2) and Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chromosomal abnormalities, including novel chromosome aberrations were detected in 54.48 per cent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased with increase in age (&gt; or = 30 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among occupational exposure factors, chromosomal aberrations significantly (P&lt;0.05) associated with pesticides exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: Our findings showed 54.48 per cent chromosome abnormalities including novel chromosome aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and these chromosome aberrations were increased with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our series a high frequency of younger population (53%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a detailed molecular genetics and aetiological factors need to be studied </plain></SENT>
