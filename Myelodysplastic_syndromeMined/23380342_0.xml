<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a modified CLABSI (MCLABSI) definition that attempts to exclude pathogens usually acquired because of disruption of mucosal barriers during the vulnerable neutropenic period following HCT that are generally included under the original definition (OCLABSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients undergoing HCT between August 2009 and December 2011 at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 73), identifying both OCLABSI and MCLABSI incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age at transplantation was 52 years (range, 16 to 70); 34 had a high (≥3) HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI); 34 received bone marrow (BM), 24 received peripheral stem cells (PSC), and 15 received umbilical cord blood cells (UCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 73 patients, 23 (31.5%) developed OCLABSI, of whom 16 (69.6%) died, and 8 (11%) developed MCLABSI, of whom 7 (87.5%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCLABSI was diagnosed a median of 9 days from HCT: 5 days (range, 2 to 12) for UCB and 78 days (range, 7 to 211) for BM/PSC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCLABSI occurred a median of 12 days from HCT, with similar earlier UCB and later BM/PSC diagnosis (P = .030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for OCLABSI in univariate analysis included CBC (P &lt; .001), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch (P = .005), low CD34(+) count (P = .007), low total nucleated cell dose (P = .016), and non-Caucasian race (P = .017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for OCLABSI in multivariable analysis were UCB (P &lt; .001) and high HCT-CI (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in mortality for both OCLABSI (hazard ratio, 7.14; CI, 3.31 to 15.37; P &lt; .001) and MCLABSI (hazard ratio, 6.44; CI, 2.28 to 18.18; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose the MCLABSI definition to replace the OCLABSI definition, given its greater precision for identifying preventable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in HCT patients </plain></SENT>
