<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients had partial or complete deletion of chromosome 5 in metaphase cells obtained throughout the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis with specific oligonucleotide probes revealed that bone marrow cells containing an activated N-ras oncogene proliferated in a dominant manner during the process of leukemic conversion in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the chromosomal abnormality may precede activation of the N-ras gene in these patients, and that both the chromosomal abnormality and the activated N-ras oncogene contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
