<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (47%) evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression model showed that the scoring system was the only significant variable for predicting transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.0007, sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of patients with a score of 14 or greater developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> compared to 19% with a score of 13 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival of the entire group was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important prognostic factor for predicting survival was the scoring system (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival correlated inversely with the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This scoring system may be useful in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
