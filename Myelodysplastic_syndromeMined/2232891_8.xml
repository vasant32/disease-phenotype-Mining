<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Half-maximal growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CFU-E and BFU-E was detected at a 4-fold higher rhEPO concentration than required by control erythroid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the patients evaluated exhibited maximal growth of erythroid colonies at 5- to 20-fold higher than control saturating rhEPO concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating EPO levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were elevated, with a mean value approximately 35-fold higher than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow CFU-E and BFU-E was 57 +/- 42% and 18 +/- 9% of the mean control values, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis of the relationships between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> EPO levels and erythroid progenitors indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not attributable to an abnormality in the capacity of EPO to induce the generation of CFU-E, but may be influenced by the BFU-E population, whose severe deficiency results in insufficient influx of EPO-responsive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings therefore suggest that treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with rhEPO may be of limited benefit, since the generation of BFU-E from more primitive ancestors and the initial growth requirements of these cells are not under the regulatory influence of this hormone </plain></SENT>
