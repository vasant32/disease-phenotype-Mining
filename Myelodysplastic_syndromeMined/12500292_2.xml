<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD87 plays a role in cellular interaction, cell migration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface expression of this antigen has not been adequately studied on bone marrow granulocytes, and the small number of previous studies has provided conflicting data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates from 11 control subjects were studied by flow cytometry and a lysed whole blood technique to compare surface expression of CD87 on marrow granulocytes with those of CD11b, CD16, CD35, and CD10, which are expressed at the myelocyte, metamyelocyte, band, and segmented stage of neutrophilic development, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four sorting experiments of CD87(+) granulocytes were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study showed no statistical difference between surface expression of CD35 and CD87 (P &gt; 0.3), whereas significant differences existed between CD87 and the other antibodies (P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sorting experiments showed that more than 80% of CD87(+) cells were bands and segmented neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dual staining for CD87 and CD35 showed that most CD87(+) granulocytes coexpress CD35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD87 is expressed on granulocytes at the band and segmented neutrophil stage of development and can be used to study <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008111'>abnormal granulopoiesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
