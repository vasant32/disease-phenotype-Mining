<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 44 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> underwent allo-HSCT: 23 received transplant from HLA-matched siblings and 21 from mismatched related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens included modified busulphan plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) regimen for the patients diagnosed as with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and Cy plus antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG) for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (sAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA), short term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX), and MMF were used for the prophylaxis of GVHD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) were diagnosed according to the international commonly accepted GVHD diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMF was added to the standard C-sA/FK506 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (PSE) as either the first line therapy, or the second line salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 15 patients were diagnosed as with aGVHD, and 29 with cGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMF was administrated as a first-line therapy drug in 19 patients and as a second-line therapy drug in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For aGVHD the overall response rate was 80% with a complete response (CR) rate of 33.33% and a partial response (PR) rate of 46.66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response rates were 70% and 100% respectively for the first line and second line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 58.3% of the responsive patients the daily dose of PSE could be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD the overall response rate was 86.2% with a CR rate of 41.37% and a PR rate of 44.83%, and the response rate were 100% and 84.21% for the first and second line therapy respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PSE taper was realized in 70.83% of the responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Side effects occurred in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The infectious complication rate was 34.09%, only one patient died of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The follow-up of 22 months (10 approximately 65 months) showed that 36 patients (81.82%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMF combined with CSA/FK506 is effective and well-tolerated in treatment for aGVHD and cGVHD </plain></SENT>
