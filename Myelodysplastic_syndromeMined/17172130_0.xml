<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using prospective cohort study to collect consecutive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of 282 MDS cases were defined according to FAB and WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>19.5% and 24.5% of cases occurred at age 50 - 59 and 70 - 79, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presence of immature granulocytes and erythroblasts in peripheral blood (PB) were found in 67% and 48% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage (68%) of FAB-RA and WHO-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients in China is relatively high compared to that in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abnormality of chromosome (31.2%) was lower than that in the West, and similar to that in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty nine percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients could be diagnosed on cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in PB and bone marrow (BM) aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety four percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be diagnosed by combination of BM aspirate and core biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety seven percent of the patients could be recognized by combination of bone marrow aspirate, core biopsy and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The subtypes and clinical features of Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were somewhat different from the West, but similar to that in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic efficiency can be extremely improved by combination of bone marrow aspirate, core biopsy and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
