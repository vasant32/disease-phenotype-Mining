<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>20 patients with a median age of 63 years suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n=17) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=3) received the antibody labelled either with 188Rhenium (n=8) or with 90Yttrium (n=12) during conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy provided a mean dose of 21.9 (+/-8.4) Gy to the bone marrow with a significantly higher dose when 90Yttrium was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional conditioning was fludarabine-based plus anti-thymocyte globulin in matched related donor transplants (n=11), or plus melphalan in matched unrelated donor transplants (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regimen-related toxicity was low, with two patients developing three episodes of grade III organ toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted, grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) was observed in one patient (5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD in three patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 25%, the cumulative incidence of relapse 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival was estimated to be 70% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years post-transplant, although no plateau was reached afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, radioimmunotherapy using the anti-CD66 antibody was feasible and safe in our elderly patient group and provided a high marrow dose </plain></SENT>
