<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (LD-Ara-C) therapy has been accepted as an effective treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) transformed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or elderly patients with ANLL, the anti-leukemic mechanism remains to be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the potential role of the Fas/Fas ligand system in chemotherapeutic drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the relationship between the anti-leukemic effect of LD-Ara-C and the Fas/Fas ligand system was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line HL60 was treated with LD-Ara-C in combination with anti-Fas IgM MoAb, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the treated cells was estimated by morphological observation, DNA electrophoresis and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, changes in Fas antigen expression on cells treated with LD-Ara-C were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only limited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed following treatment with LD-Ara-C alone or anti-Fas MoAb alone; however, a synergistic increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed by treatment with the MoAb in combination with pretreatment with LD-Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LD-Ara-C induced a slight but consistent increase in the expression of Fas antigen on the treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of Fas antigen was enhanced by repeated administration of LD-Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the possible involvement of the Fas/Fas ligand system in the anti-leukemic effect of LD-Ara-C therapy </plain></SENT>
