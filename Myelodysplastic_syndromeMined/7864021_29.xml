<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the roles played by cell birth and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates in generating this paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell kinetics from BM biopsies of 35 MDS patients were measured using intravenous infusions of either iododeoxyuridine or bromodeoxyuridine, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) was estimated using in situ end-labeling of DNA directly from BM biopsies, which were simultaneously double-labeled from proliferation/PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were found to be highly proliferative disorders with large numbers of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells synthesizing DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median cycling time (Tc) of myeloblasts was more rapid than that of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (44.1 hr vs. 56.0 hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most marrow cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lineages in 32 of 34 evaluable cases were undergoing PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 19 of 32 patients, greater than 75% cells were apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, large numbers of S-phase cells were found to be simultaneously undergoing PCD, as were stromal cells of the BM microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hematopoietic cells effectively cancels the high birth rate resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis and accounting for deficient bone marrow function </plain></SENT>
