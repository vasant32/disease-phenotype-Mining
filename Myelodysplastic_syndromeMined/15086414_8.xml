<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on seven patients with myeloid diseases characterized by i(20q-) anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients were male and three were female, their median age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis at presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in six patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four died but three survived and remain anaemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survivals were 6 months for patient 1, 7 months for patient 2, 17 d for patient 4 and 28 d for patient 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome specimens were prepared by direct and/or short-term culture of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was performed by R- and G-banding technique, which showed that one of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 20 was substituted by one or two small metacentric chromosomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was ider(20)(q10)del(20)(q11q13), i.e. i(20q-) in six patients by dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using two probes (a subtelomeric probe for 20q and an unique probe for 20q12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, this anomaly has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we consider that i(20q-) is a novel and rare recurrent chromosomal abnormality that is specifically associated with myeloid diseases and may indicate a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
