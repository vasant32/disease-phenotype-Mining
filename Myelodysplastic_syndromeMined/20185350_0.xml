<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of medical records of patients who received 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> 75mg/m(2) subcutaneously for during 7 days every 28 days in twelve cycles as compassionate use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the objective response, clinical improvement and time to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recorded adverse reactions described in the medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients were candidates for treatment with 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases were evaluated over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most remained in partial response or better after the study, and no longer needed transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the treatment appeared to delay progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> might be considered an effective and relatively safe drug, and may have contributed to controlling peripheral cytopenias, improving the quality of life and delaying progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies with more patients are needed to support these results </plain></SENT>
