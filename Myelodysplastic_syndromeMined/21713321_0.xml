<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> increases platelet count is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> on megakaryocyte maturation and platelet release in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> on megakaryocyte maturation was studied in an in vitro megakaryocyte differentiation model utilising mouse bone marrow cells and mouse megakaryoblastic cell line L8057 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> (2.5 μM) is able to induce L8057 cells to differentiate into a megakaryocyte-like <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> cells with positive markers of acetylcholinesterase and αIIb integrin (CD41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of αIIb integrin was also found in primary mouse bone marrow cells and human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured with both thrombopoietin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> as compared to thrombopoietin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we noted a 30% platelet count increase in Balb/c mice 12 hours after the injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> at a clinically relevant dose (15 mg/m2), suggesting a rapid platelet release from the spleen or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> increases platelet counts by enhancing platelet release and megakaryocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
