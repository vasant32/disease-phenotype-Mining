<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, from progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e> largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders </plain></SENT>
