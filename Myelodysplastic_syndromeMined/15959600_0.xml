<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Children suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> (DS) are predisposed to the development of neoplastic disorders of the hematopoietic system and tend to display many unique characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 16 children with DS who developed neoplastic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DS patients aged &lt; 18 years of age with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) from 1990 to 2002 were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients, including age at diagnosis, gender, initial hemogram, cytogenetic findings, immunophenotype, treatment regimen and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 9 patients (56%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), mainly of the megakaryoblastic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 AML patients who had analyzable metaphase cells revealed clonal chromosomal abnormalities in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients who underwent chemotherapy, 3 remained in remission with a survival time of 29, 59, and 109 months, and the remaining 2 died as a consequence of chemotherapy toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 6 patients (38%) who developed transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, 2 were lost to follow-up, 2 died from DS-associated congenital heart abnormalities and 2 survived without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 1 patient (6%) who developed ALL was still in his first remission although this patient suffered profound chemotherapy complications during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is the most common hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in Taiwanese children with DS, especially megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding is comparable to the reported results from related studies in different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in DS patients can be achieved with appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
