<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is little published information on the everyday clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in real world practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> attending 74 French centers in a 1-week period for inpatient admission, day-hospital care or outpatient visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred and seven patients were included; 67.3% had lower-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (International Prognostic Scoring System: low or intermediate-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotype had been analyzed in 82.5% of the cases and was more often of intermediate or poor risk in patients under 65 years old compared with those who were older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell transfusions accounted for as many as 31.4% of the admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous erythropoietin level was less than 500 IU/L in 88% of the patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythroid stimulating agents had been or were being used in 36.8% of the lower risk patients, iron chelation in 31% of lower risk patients requiring red blood cell transfusions and lenalidomide in 41% of lower risk patients with del 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and allogeneic stem cell transplantation had been or were being used in 14.8%, 31.1%, 8.8% and 5.1%, respectively, of higher-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Karyotype is now assessed in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and patients under 65 years old may have more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from erythroid-stimulating agents and, in higher-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, hypomethylating agents, specific treatments are used in a minority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and red blood cell transfusions still represent the major reason for hospital admission </plain></SENT>
