<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modulation of resistance has been attempted in different studies, but the results have been contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted an open, randomized multicenter clinical trial involving patients more than 60 years old with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> preceded by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The induction chemotherapy regimen included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (group A); randomization involved simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> per os (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients were evaluated, 26 in group A and 29 in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall complete remission was achieved in 40% of the patients, 27% vs 52% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival was more favorable in patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi>, 12 vs 7 months for groups B and A, respectively (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a follow up period of 30 months, 7 out of 55 patients (13%) were alive, 4 of whom were in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five out of the 7 alive patients were randomized in group B and had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure was higher in group A [19 of 26 patients (73%)] than in group B with CsA [14 of 29 patients (48%)] (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related toxicity/mortality was 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Modulation of drug resistance by CsA in elderly people suffering from secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> may improve the outcome of chemotherapy without increasing drug toxicity and treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
