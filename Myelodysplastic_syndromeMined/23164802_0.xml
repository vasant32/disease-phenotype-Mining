<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied outcome of alloSCT in chromosome 7 abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as this data are scarce in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We specifically focused on the impact of the extra presence of CK and monosomal karyotype (MK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database contained data on 277 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a chromosome 7 abnormality treated with alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age at alloSCT was 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of patients alive was 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 22% and 28%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors for worse PFS were higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stages treated, but not in complete remission (CR) (hazards ratio (HR) 1.7), and the presence of CK (HR 1.5) or MK (HR 1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Negative predictive factors for OS were higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stages treated, but not in CR (HR 1.8), and the presence of CK (HR 1.6) or MK (HR 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By means of the cross-validated log partial likelihood, MK showed to have a better predictive value than CK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results are relevant when considering alloSCT for higher-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients having MK including a chromosome 7 abnormality </plain></SENT>
