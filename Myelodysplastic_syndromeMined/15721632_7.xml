<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When cytogenetic abnormalities are complex, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) can help clarify complex chromosomal abnormalities and identify rearrangements with prognostic value or cryptic translocations, which could be preliminary steps in identifying new genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied by M-FISH 28 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with complex chromosomal abnormalities, 10 of them were therapy-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>M-FISH allowed the characterization of unidentified chromosomal material in 26 cases (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One or several unbalanced rearrangements were observed in 27 cases (96%), generally interpreted as deletions or additional material by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those translocations, 4 involved 3 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cryptic translocations undetected by CC were found in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By FISH analysis using locus specific probes, TP53 deletion, additional copies of MLL, and additional copies or deletions of RUNX1/AML1 were observed in 16, 4, and 3 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, M-FISH is an important tool to characterize complex chromosomal abnormalities which identified unbalanced and cryptic translocations in 96% and 46% of the cases studied, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complementary FISH helped us identify involvement of TP53, MLL, and RUNX1/AML1 genes in 82% of cases, confirming their probable role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
