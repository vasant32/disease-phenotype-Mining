<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The current therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is unsatisfactory and comprises mainly supportive treatment or antileukemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies about successful immunosuppressive therapy suggest an autoimmune mechanism in subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) from 15 patients with low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), and from 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors were depleted of CD2(+), CD5(+), and CD7(+) lymphocytes using magnetic cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depleted and nondepleted MNC were seeded onto irradiated allogeneic bone marrow stroma and the generation of colony-forming-cells (CFC), the clonal origin of hemopoietic progenitor cells in long-term bone marrow culture (LTC), was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The capacity of MNC from 7 healthy donors to generate hemopoiesis remained unchanged in the lymphocyte-depleted LTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cultures initiated with lymphocyte-depleted MNC from patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> exhibited a significantly increased generation of CFC compared with the corresponding nondepleted cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis in 6 patients revealed that a significantly increased number of CFC grown in lymphocyte-depleted LTC showed no allelic loss, suggesting an outgrowth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results provide a rationale for the recently described successful treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in certain subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoiesis is suppressed by autoimmune mechanisms, eventually allowing the expansion of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
