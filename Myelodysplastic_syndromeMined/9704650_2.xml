<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after current or previous treatment with alkylating drugs were selected for evaluation by chart review and cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> (mean age 56.9 years) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven had received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and 1 chlorambucil as their main immunosuppressive drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean total cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> was 118 gm and 6.5 gm, respectively, over a period of 2-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic abnormalities included a deletion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of chromosome 7 in 5 patients, while 4 had a deletion of part of the long arm of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients have since died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Large cumulative doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> were associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the occurrence of abnormalities of chromosome 5 and/or chromosome 7 deletions, and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
