<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the in vitro growth patterns of BFU-E, four groups of patients have been identified: i) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BFU-E growth; ii) low spontaneous BFU-E growth, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>; iii) impaired BFU-E response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>; iv) no BFU-E growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of BFU-E growth seems to be related to the clinical stage of the disease rather than to the FAB subgroup to which the patients belong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of T lymphocytes to stimulate BFU-E growth was significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms inducing the impaired production of BPA by T lymphocytes are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vitro evaluation of circulating erythroid precursors can supply useful prognostic information and possibly indications concerning the responsiveness of erythropoietic stem cells to recombinant human erythropoietin in vivo </plain></SENT>
