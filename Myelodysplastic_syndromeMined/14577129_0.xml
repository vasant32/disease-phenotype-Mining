<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For control of the electron microscopic observations nucleoli in erythroblasts were also visualized by two widely used cytochemical procedures for the demonstration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and AgNOR proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previously described ultrastructure of nucleoli in "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" erythroblasts, nucleoli of ringed erythroblasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were frequently characterized by a reduced incidence or lack of dense <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) containing granular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the dense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> containing granular components represent preribosomes, such sideroblasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibit a further nucleolar abnormality, which reflects a severe alteration of the nucleolar ribosome assembly in these abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the alteration of the preribosome assembly was not noted in early developmental stages of ringed sideroblasts such as proerythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, nucleoli in advanced or terminal stages of few ringed sideroblasts also did not exhibit such nucleolar abnormality and thus confirm a great structural and functional variability of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The defect of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> containing structures in nucleoli of advanced and terminal stages of erythroblasts are in a hormony with the light microscopic cytochemistry, which demonstrated a significantly smaller incidence of micronucleoli in specimens stained for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than in those stained for AgNOR (silver stained nucleolus organizer region) proteins </plain></SENT>
