<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to perform chromosome analysis of cryopreserved malignant marrow or peripheral blast cells is important for retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the karyotype of fresh bone marrow cells (20 metaphases) to that of cells stored with a simplified cryopreservation method, evaluated the effect of the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an in vitro mitotic index stimulator, and compared the cell viability and chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of fresh and cryopreserved cells whenever possible (sufficient metaphases for analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five bone marrow samples from 24 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8, 3, 3, 8, 1, and 1 patients, respectively) were selected at diagnosis, at relapse or during routine follow-up and one sample was obtained from a bone marrow donor after informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average cell viability before and after freezing was 98.8 and 78.5%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 76% of fresh cell cultures, as opposed to 52% of cryopreserved samples (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF had no proliferative effect before or after freezing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphological aspects of the chromosomes in fresh and cryopreserved cells were subjectively the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that cytogenetic analysis of cryopreserved bone marrow cells can be a reliable alternative when fresh cell analysis cannot be done, notwithstanding the <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp> and lower percent of successful analysis that are associated with freezing </plain></SENT>
