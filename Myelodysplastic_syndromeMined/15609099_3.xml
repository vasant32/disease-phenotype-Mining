<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> has been implicated in the pathogenesis and evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the proliferative activity and extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was examined in bone marrow samples from 54 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in relation to clinicopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular proliferation and microvascular density (MVD) were examined immunohistochemically, using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1 (Ki-67) and an anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the MIB-1 Labeling Index (MIB-1 LI), MVD and IL-6 increased significantly with advancing severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-FAB subtypes, MIB-1 LI, MVD and IL-6 were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in comparison to RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0001 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MIB-1 and MVD were increased in patients with score 3 in comparison to scores 0 and 1 in the IPSS system (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters studied were significantly higher in patients versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cellular proliferative activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> are associated with disease progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
