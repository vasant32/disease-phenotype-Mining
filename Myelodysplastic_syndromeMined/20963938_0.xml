<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: CEBPA mutations are found in the leukemic cells of approximately 9% of persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, including 15%-18% of persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-karyotype <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; however, few of these individuals have a germline mutation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic testing of CEBPA is available on a clinical basis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whenever possible, persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> should be treated as part of a clinical trial protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: similar to that for other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (i.e., administration of blood products such as red blood cell and platelet transfusions as needed; treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> with antibiotics; and use of prophylactic antibiotics and anti-fungal agents during periods of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the possible lifelong increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in persons with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with mutated CEBPA who are cured of their initial disease, additional (possibly lifelong) surveillance may be warranted </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cases caused by a de novo germline mutation is unknown; currently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven reported affected individuals have had an affected parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the germline mutation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Requests for prenatal testing for conditions that do not affect intellect and have treatment available are not common </plain></SENT>
