<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively recorded down the general features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> and PMR diagnosed at our center within the last 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates per 100000 aged &gt; or =50 were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we reported the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>/PMR in our previous epidemiologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> (10F, 9M) and 53 with isolated PMR (39F, 14M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> in subjects &gt; or =50 years old was 1.13/100000, and for PMR it was 3.15/100000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> and PMR in females were, respectively, 1.14/100000 and 4.48/100000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In males, the incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> and PMR were, respectively, calculated as 1.1/100000 and 1.72/100000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our population-based study, the prevalences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> and PMR (&gt; or =50 ages) were estimated as 20/100000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (73.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> patients had symptoms of PMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had developed unilateral and one patient bilateral permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial ESR was lower than 40 mm/hr in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> patient (5.3%) and in 6 PMR patients (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median duration of follow-up was 16 months in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>; and 8 months in PMR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient with PMR and another patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One PMR patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We detected a lower frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>/PMR in our center in northwestern Turkey than in Scandinavian and southern European countries </plain></SENT>
