<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation can lead to posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD), which carries a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among therapeutic and prophylactic options being developed, B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with monoclonal antibodies is encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load after transplantation is correlated with PTLD occurrence, we developed a preemptive attitude based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-guided rituximab administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We monitored 115 transplant patients with a quantitative PCR for EBV DNA performed on whole-blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria for treatment initiation were a single PCR above 40,000 DNA genome copies per milliliter (gCop/mL) or two rising values above 10,000 gCop/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weekly rituximab infusion at the dose of 375 mg/m was administered until negative PCR results were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the incidence of EBV reactivation and PTLD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (16.5%) met the criteria for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of reactivation was the same in high-risk and standard-risk patients (12 vs. 7, P=0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed PTLD after discontinuation of therapy due to a serious adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other serious adverse events were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> load disappeared after a median of three cycles of therapy, and weekly monitoring allowed prompt intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No PTLD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in the treated population was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our PCR-guided and rituximab-based preemptive approach to avoid PTLD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is feasible but probably overtreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prospective trials are strongly needed, they should use uniform PCR techniques and consider higher threshold values for treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
