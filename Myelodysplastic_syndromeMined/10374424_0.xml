<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the characteristics of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> binding proteins (FBP) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and to study the clinical significance of reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier (RFC) present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its relationship with multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The features of FBP on bone marrow cells were analyzed using radiolabeled 3H-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (3H-FA) binding membrane proteins and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the same time, P-glucoprotein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> gene were detected using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two kinds of FBP, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> receptor (FR) and reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier (RFC), were found on the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same results were presented on mononuclear cells of bone marrow in 5 out of 14 MDS patients, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> positive was seen in 4 patiens of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and other 9 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> FRs were only found on the mononuclear cells of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier, which is present in the leukemic cell, is a product of neoplastic cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It might reveal preleukmic state and have the same significance with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> that RFC is found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
