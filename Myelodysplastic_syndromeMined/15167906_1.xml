<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of FAM-treated patients were compared with those of 32 PGP-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients fulfilling identical inclusion and response criteria treated with MXN+AraC (1 g/m(2)/12 h d(1-5), MA protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 patients (median age 55 years) were included in the FAM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six (21%) died from the procedure, and 16 (55%) achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, nine received consolidation chemotherapy, five were autografted and two were allografted in first CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotype was the only factor associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall median follow-up was 10.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between FAM and MA protocols with respect to CR rate, treatment-related mortality, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, autologous stem cell transplantation feasibility, relapse-free survival, or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was significantly longer in the FAM protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present results suggest that the combination therapy of fludarabine, MXN, and high-dose AraC does not improve CR rate, survival, or disease-free survival in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
