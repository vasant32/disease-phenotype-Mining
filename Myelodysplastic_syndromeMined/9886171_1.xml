<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FA is different from acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in terms of the natural course and treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the frequency of FA is unknown in Korea, we conducted screening tests using DNA clastogenic agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>) and mitomicin C (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) in southwestern Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three children with AA or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes and siblings of known FA were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients with AA (6/24=25.0%) and a 2-month-old patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003220'>increased chromosomal breakage</z:hpo> to both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>, confirming the diagnosis of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No overlap in chromosomal breakage to both agents was found between the FA group and non-FA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FA in this study, much higher than those of previous studies in Korea which did not incorporate the above tests, was similar to that of other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> tests were readily feasible and useful in screening FA in patients with AA as well as other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nation-wide screening and registry for FA should be initiated since FA requires different therapeutic and management options from idiopathic AA </plain></SENT>
