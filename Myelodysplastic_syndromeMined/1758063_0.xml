<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 42-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) complaining of right hypochondralgia and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was admitted to the hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gall stone</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood examination revealed bicytopenia (leukocytes, 1,700/microliters and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, 8.5 g/dl) and bone marrow examination showed normocellular but hypererythroid bone marrow and dyshematopoiesis, which suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data revealed obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and Ham tests, which were compatible with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholecystectomy was successful, and the patient showed no postoperative complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>increased hemolysis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level gradually decreased for the first two postoperative weeks, filtrated white cell-depleted red blood cells (total, 1,000 ml) were transfused instead of washed red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No side effects of the transfusion were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of findings in this case and those reported in the literature, it is concluded that in some case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, the use of washed red blood cells is unnecessary, and that the use of white cell-depleted red blood cells is indicated </plain></SENT>
