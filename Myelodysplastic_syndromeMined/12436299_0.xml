<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal selection of a stem cell as a first step in the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> can be achieved by an alteration of this self-renewal potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), is based on the assumption that they represent a clonal disorder resulting from transformation of a hematopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when performing methods for determining X-chromosome inactivation in female patients as a clonality marker, a significant minority of the patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph(-)) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibit polyclonal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results are not yet clarified and the lack of a proven target cell impairs the understanding of the underlying molecular defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this context, altered response to cytokine stimulation in vitro provides indirect information concerning molecular dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> present with translocations that facilitate molecular investigation and clonality proof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They nearly always result in rearrangements of at least one transcription factor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of these fusion genes are constitutively active, sending out continuous proliferative and antiapoptotic signals or activate an overlapping set of signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The classical example for a balanced translocation is the t(9;22) bcr-abl aberration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogeneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many other karyotypic abnormalities have also been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and involve deletions of chromosomes 20q, 13q, 1q, 7q and 5q as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 8 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our increased understanding of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and the molecular basis of regulation of its self-renewal and differentiation bears a direct impact on our understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evolution and progression </plain></SENT>
