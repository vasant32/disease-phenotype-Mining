<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirates from healthy donors contain a fraction of low density multicellular spheroids, 100-500 microns in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are organized in a three-dimensional network consisting of central preadipocytes/adipocytes, mesenchymal and reticular cells, and resident macrophages that are closely associated with myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and with their progenies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These spheroids are 2- to 5- fold more abundant in progenitor cells compared with the whole bone marrow as estimated by monoclonal antibody markers My 10 and T 9, by analysis of granulocyte--macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) and by cytological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They produce terminally differentiated cells in organotypic microcultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a multicellular spheroid may represent the fundamental unit of primary hematopoiesis; we therefore name it hematon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the presence of hematons in bone marrow aspirates correlated positively with homeostatic blood cell production: they were present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (BM) (19/25), and absent in myelodysplasic syndromes (MDPS) (8/21), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (ANLL) (3/22) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) (2/28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hematons were recovered under hematological remission in MDPS and in ANLL, suggesting that they may be dispersed reversibly in certain disease conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hematons represent a unifying model around which the variability in some bone marrow cell functions can be explored </plain></SENT>
