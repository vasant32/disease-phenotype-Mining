<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epoetin alpha was given subcutaneously daily at a dose of 3,000IU/body for two weeks and the dosage was increased to 6,000IU, 12,000IU, and 24,000IU at two week interval when the increment of Hb was insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom the Hb concentration increased by more than 1g/dl or whose blood transfusion requirement reduced to below 50% were considered to be cases of effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of effectiveness was 20.6% (7/34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to epoetin alpha treatment was better in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high dose epoetin alpha (12,000-24,000IU/body/day) was required for the patients to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the high dose subcutaneous epoetin alpha treatment is effective for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in terms of increasing Hb concentration and reducing blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
