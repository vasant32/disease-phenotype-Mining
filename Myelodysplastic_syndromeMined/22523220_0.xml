<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other cells contaminate the "blast gate" (BG); CD45/SS gating is thus imprecise, particularly when there are few blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the BG contents in 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), 14 myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPNs), 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMMLs</z:e>), and 40 nonneoplastic control samples using 4-color FC with cluster analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences across groups in the median percentage of BG events represented by blasts (14.7%-22%), granulocytes (23.3%-33.2%), lymphocytes (2.1%-3.2%), and erythroids (1.0%-9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes were a larger percentage of BG events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (24.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basophils averaged 35.4% of the BG in MPNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of blasts within the BG averaged 94.2% in control samples vs 88.2% in MDSs and 80.7% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMMLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blasts averaged about 20% of events in the BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About 10% to 20% of blasts fell outside the BG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMMLs</z:e> and MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data highlight pitfalls in using a traditional BG for blast analysis in nonacute myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
