<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their diagnosis requires the exclusion of other hematological or immunological disorders whose diagnosis is usually not difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in some patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the differential diagnosis is complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study of 47 consecutive patients treated between 1990 and 2001; in 25 patients the initial diagnosis was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, in 22 it was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; we compared their backgrounds, laboratory data and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 ITP patients, there were 5 confusing cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, they presented with inexplicable <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytopenia, the polyploidization pattern of megakaryocytes, and chromosomal aberrations were of diagnostic relevance in these patients' defective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their cytopenia progressed relatively slowly and none progressed to leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
