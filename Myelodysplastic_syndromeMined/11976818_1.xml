<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the efficacy of AMF in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and the possible predicting value for response to AMF therapy of two types of in vitro clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two different doses of AMF, 300 mg/m2 (group A, 11 patients) or 400 mg/m2 (group B, 16 patients), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AMF was given three times weekly for 3 weeks, i.v., followed by 2 weeks off therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated after two cycles of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partially or nonresponding patients of group A received 400 mg/m2 AMF and were reevaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) values of more than 2 g/dl and a 100% decrease in transfusion requirements for at least 6 weeks were defined as a complete response (CR) while an increase of Hb values of 1-2 g/dl or a 50% decrease in transfusion requirements was considered as a partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group A, two out of 11 (18.1%) patients achieved a CR with the initial dose and one of the nine that received 400 mg/m2 AMF achieved a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group B, three out of 16 (18.7%) patients achieved a PR; the overall response rate in both groups was 22.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group A, bone marrow progenitor assay was performed pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) were increased in six out of 11 (54.5%) patients, and this increase preceded the rise in Hb levels in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group B, a clonogenic assay was performed in 11 out of 16 patients before AMF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vitro results after pretreatment with 500 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> confirmed the response of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients that achieved a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No response in vitro was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight nonresponding patients and in one PR patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The lack of response in the clonogenic assays predicted for nonresponse to treatment with a predictive power of 91.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 300 mg/m2 is an adequate initial treatment for low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and both clonogenic assays have a strong predicting value for response to treatment </plain></SENT>
