<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases, which showed leukemic change of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), developed lymph node swelling and muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>; both were infiltrated mainly with plasma cells, without preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of plasma cells was polyclonal and was proven by negative rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene or polyclonal staining of immunoglobulin light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272249" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyclonal gammopathy</z:e> and autoantibody production such as positive antinuclear factor and direct antiglobulin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As was observed in one of the present cases, and as we reported previously, the elevated level of soluble Fas antigen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and its inhibition of apoptotic signaling may be responsible for the excessive accumulation of self-reactive B cells, resulting in these clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
