<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FLAMSA-RIC protocol for high-risk patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> has shown promising results in refractory disease as well as in first complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Still, the RIC protocol containing 4 Gy TBI/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) implicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity mainly due to TBI preventing its usage in patients with advanced age and/or severe co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To increase feasibility and safety of the conditioning, we substituted TBI with treosulfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with relapsed or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and either advanced age or concomitant disease were treated within a preparative regimen containing a 4-day course of chemotherapy (FLAMSA) followed by RIC comprising of treosulfan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After median follow-up of 12 months, the estimated incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 25% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-year overall survival was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FLAMSA-treosulfan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ATG is an intermediate intensity conditioning regimen with acceptable non-relapse mortality for patients with relapsed or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Substituting TBI with treosulfan provides an alternative to treat elderly patients or patients with severe co-morbidities when TBI appears not feasible due to the potential of increased toxicity </plain></SENT>
