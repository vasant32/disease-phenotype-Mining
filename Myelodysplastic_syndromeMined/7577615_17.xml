<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 17 patients with a chromosome 16 abnormality (eight M4Eo, two M1, one M2, three M4 without abnormal eosinophils, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) for the presence of CBFB/MYH11 transcripts using an RT-PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>10 AML patients with inv(16) tested RT-PCR positive (eight at presentation, one in remission, one in remission and relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients were originally reported by cytogenetic analysis to have del(16q22) but the positive RT-PCR results prompted a cytogenetic re-examination, resulting in the correction of the reports to inv(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that although inv(16) is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4Eo, it can also be detected in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4 without abnormal eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with inv(16) were also RT-PCR positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients with other chromosome 16 abnormalities were RT-PCR negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with inv(16) were studied in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were RT-PCR positive, including one patient in remission for 108 months and one 22 months post allogeneic bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter two remission patients, RT-PCR evaluation was positive in bone marrow (BM) but not in peripheral blood, suggesting that BM may be the more informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this technique is valuable in the accurate molecular classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, particularly as treatment options may be influenced by such information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Though RT-PCR is highly sensitive in detecting CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcripts during remission, monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in patients with inv(16) remains to be established </plain></SENT>
