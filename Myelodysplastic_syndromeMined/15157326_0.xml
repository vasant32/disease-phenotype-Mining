<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cytogenetic and clinical characteristics in patients with abnormalities at the short arm of chromosome 12, chromosome specimens were prepared by 24-hour culture of bone marrow cells and undergone karyotype analysis by G-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that aberration at the short arm of chromosome 12 were detected in 16 cases with 12p balanced translocation, in 10 cases with 12p deletion, 6 cases with 12p addition, and in 1 case with inversion 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By complex karyotype classification, 12p translocation included 6 simple aberrations, 6 complex aberrations, and 4 highly complex aberrations; while 12p deletion were mainly composed of highly complexity of aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up data were available in 14 patients, in which 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were treated with conventional chemotherapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of them attained complete remission, and the median survival time in 8 patients was 5.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the aberrations at short arm of chromosome 12 were involved in a broad spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e>, and the karyotypes showed most complexity of aberration with low remission rate and short survival in clinic </plain></SENT>
