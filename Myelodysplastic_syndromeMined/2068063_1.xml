<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined AgNOR-stained bone marrow smears from 30 selected patients and compared the results with the conventional <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> (PB) method for staining storage iron and sideroblasts, including ringed sideroblasts (RS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid cells were easily identified, and iron granules stained as distinct, small, round, black dots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases containing sideroblasts and RS, their proportion expressed as the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> normoblasts was higher with AgNOR than with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pronormoblastic and basophilic sideroblasts were detected more often with AgNOR than with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sideroblasts were noted in cases with no PB-stainable iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ringed sideroblasts were identified in a number of cases in which they were nondetectable with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, pronormoblastic and basophilic RS were found more often than with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemosiderin deposits within the macrophages were clearly visualized as black aggregates and were seen in cases with no PB-stainable iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no instances where iron or any category of sideroblasts was seen with PB only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our sampling, the AgNOR method was more sensitive yet specific, and it produced staining results of superior quality </plain></SENT>
