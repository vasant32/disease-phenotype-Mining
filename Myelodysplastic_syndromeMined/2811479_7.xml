<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RA has been used in treatment of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous experiments we had observed that RA may decrease the self-renewal of blast cells in established cell lines, and in our clinic RA has been tested as maintenance treatment in association with chemotherapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we asked if exposure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blast cells to RA affected their subsequent response to ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that brief exposure to RA regularly increased the ara-C sensitivity of cells from two established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar, though less marked, effect was seen when the blast cells from one patient were tested directly; in a second instance, highly ara-C resistant blasts did not become sensitive when exposed to RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments using high specific activity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> did not disclose any changes in the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells in the DNA synthesis phase of the cycle at times when their responses to ara-C were changing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We interpret our findings as support for continuing efforts to integrate RA in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and suggest that the mechanism of ara-C sensitization may not depend on changes in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
