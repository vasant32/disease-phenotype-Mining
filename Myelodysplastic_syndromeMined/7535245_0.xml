<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) in the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), marrow progenitor cells from 18 MDS patients were highly purified using CD34 monoclonal antibody and immunomagnetic microspheres (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells were cultured in serum-free medium with various combinations of five colony stimulating factors (CSFs): recombinant human interleukin-3 (rIL-3), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), macrophage-CSF (rM-CSF), and erythropoietin (rEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the tested CSFs, such as rM-CSF, rG-CSF, rGM-CSF and rIL-3, a combination of the first three CSFs was the most effective stimulus for the proliferation of non-erythroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase of undifferentiated "blast" cell colonies in 5/18 MDS patients occurred and these 5 patients belonged to the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of these three CSFs, rIL-3 had no effect on the proliferation and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells; however, IL-3 was efficient for the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells to the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rGM-CSF or rIL-3 alone did not efficiently support proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M-CSF is present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum at a concentration of 550 +/- 110 U/ml, a concentration exceeding that used in this study (100 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in vivo administration of G-CSF combined with GM-CSF to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may be one of the most effective CSF combinations for proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells to the non-erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the effect on the capacity for differentiation was minimal, especially in patients belonging to the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
