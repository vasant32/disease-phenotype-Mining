<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 group, only one case displayed the expected one orange and one green (1O + 1G) FISH pattern in a majority of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other five patients instead showed 1O + 2G FISH signals in 17-86% of the bone marrow cells, which is the typical pattern for del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the del(5q) group, 26-98% of the bone marrow cells exhibited 1O + 2G FISH signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed clonal involvement of the myeloid cell lineages, including the megakaryocytes in a few cases, whereas lymphoid cells generally exhibited the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 2O + 2G FISH pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, those with del(5q) and a complex karyotype, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We were thus unable to confirm the recent suggestion that B-cells are a part of the abnormal clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, true <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 seems to be rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
