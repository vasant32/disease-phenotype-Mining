<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dyserythropoietic changes had a similar incidence in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared with the clinical features at initial diagnosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases, the dysmegakaryocytic changes in remission marrow were found to be significantly more frequent in patients with monocytic involvement (mainly M4) or trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (T-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with micromegakaryocytes (P less than 0.05) or neutrophils with hypogsegmented nuclei (P less than 0.05) than in those without these features </plain></SENT>
