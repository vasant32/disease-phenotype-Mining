<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report outcomes of 932 recipients of unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-PBSC HCT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> enrolled on a prospective National Marrow Donor Program trial from 1999 through 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preparative regimens included myeloablative (MA; N = 611), reduced-intensity (RI; N = 160), and nonmyeloablative (NMA; N = 161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For MA recipients, CD34(+) counts greater than 3.8 x 10(6)/kg improved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, whereas improved overall survival (OS) and reduced transplant-related mortality (TRM) were seen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparative regimens when CD34(+) cell doses exceeded 4.5 x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher infused doses of CD34(+) cell dose did not result in increased rates of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of recipients of MA, RI, and NMA approaches were similar (33%, 35%, and 32% OS; 33%, 30%, and 29% DFS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, recipients of URD-PBSC HCT receiving preparative regimens differing in intensity experienced similar survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher CD34(+) cell doses resulted in more rapid engraftment, less TRM, and better 3-year OS (39% versus 25%, MA, P = .004; 38% versus 21% RI/NMA, P = .004) but did not increase the risk of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00785525 </plain></SENT>
