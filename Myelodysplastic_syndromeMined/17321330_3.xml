<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ider(20)(p11.21)del(20)(q11q13) anomaly was recognized only recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, its frequency and clinical significance has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to small size and ambiguous G-band pattern, ider(20q) is usually missed in cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the commercial FISH probe D20S108 does not distinguish among del(20q), ider(20q), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we determined the frequency and hematopathology of patients with ider(20q), and the best cytogenetic methods to detect chromosome 20 anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To do this, we performed FISH on interphase and metaphase cells for 12 patients with -20,+mar and 12 patients with only del(20q) in their karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The marker chromosome in patients with -20,+mar proved to be ider(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH with D20S108 and 20qter distinguished ider(20q) from del(20q) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Review of blood and bone marrow slides for nine patients with ider(20q) showed that one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with ider(20q) had a more consistent presentation of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with additional involvement of the granulocytic series than patients with del(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows ider(20q) is common in clinical practice--1/10th the incidence of del(20q)--and is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
