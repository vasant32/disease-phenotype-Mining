<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable (TCRAV) and T-cell receptor beta-chain variable (TCRBV) region repertoires in peripheral bloods from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-cells bearing TCR ADV14S1/BV5S2, AV21S1/BV21S4, and AV2S2/BV7S2 segments were markedly increased in three of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a positive relationship between the increase in the number of CD8-positive T-cells and the expression levels of these TCR transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CD8-positive T-cells monoclonally or oligoclonally expanded in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also determined the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCR alpha- and beta-chains of the expanded T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unique sequences were detected in a high percentage of the respective CDR3 clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gene segment of the variable and joining regions, however, varied among the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequences of CDR3 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among the patients, and there was no common motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate there is monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferation of CD8-positive T-cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo>, and suggest that these proliferating T-cells are responsible for the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> entity </plain></SENT>
