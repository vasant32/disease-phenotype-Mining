<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The bone marron mononuclear cells from 14 MDS patients were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methylation of P15INK4B gene was detected with restrictive endonucleases combined with PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one of the patients who had progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi> in vitro to test the change of methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No methylation of P15INK4B gene was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation of P15K4B gene was found in 4 MDS patients with high-risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 4 patients who had progressed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi>, the methylation went down by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P15INK4B gene hypermethylation is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi> have demethylating effect on the cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
