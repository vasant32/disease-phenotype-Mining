<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used Southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to define the breakpoints of a reciprocal translocation, t(10;12)(q24;p13), acquired as a secondary abnormality in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome positive</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A YAC clone that spanned the breakpoint at 12p13 was identified; this YAC included the CDKN1B gene but did not include ETV6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither ETV6 nor CDKN1B was rearranged, as determined by FISH and Southern blotting; however, a small deletion encompassing the translocated CDKN1B allele was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of two candidate genes at 10q24, HOX11 and NFKB2 suggested that they are not involved in this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preliminary mapping of breakpoints in this case demonstrated that they are different from an apparently identical translocation identified previously in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The identification of the split YAC and small deletion should enable a more focused search for a gene or genes that may contribute to progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
