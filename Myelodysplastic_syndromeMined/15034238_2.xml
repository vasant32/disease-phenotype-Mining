<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the first case of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with t(3;3) (q21;q26) occurring in a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected patient sequentially treated with chemotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(3;3) is a nonrandom abnormality found in a small percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and is strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000228'>abnormal thrombopoiesis</z:mp> and a particularly poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, it has never been observed in HIV-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> have been reported in HIV patients and the feasibility of chemotherapy in association with HAART and disease outcome are still not clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the poor response to chemotherapy in our case, which might also be related to the unfavorable karyotype, the secondary nature of the disease and the HIV positivity, the patient had a relatively long period of survival that could be due to the use of HAART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of chemotherapy with HAART appeared to be feasible and tolerable and could be suggested as a choice treatment in this peculiar subset of HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
