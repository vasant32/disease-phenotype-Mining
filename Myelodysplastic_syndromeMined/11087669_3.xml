<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, C5ORF5 contains a putative rhoGAP domain at the N-terminus, C5ORF6 has a proline-rich sequence near the N-terminus, and C5ORF7 has a zinc-finger domain that partially overlaps the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
