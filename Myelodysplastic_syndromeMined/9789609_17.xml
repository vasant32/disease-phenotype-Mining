<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL-t) is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous haematopoietic support was therefore evaluated as consolidation of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients received high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (cyclo + TBI) with autologous bone marrow (BM; n = 24) or peripheral blood progenitor cell support (PBPC; n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BM was treated in vitro with anti-B cell antibodies and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 27 patients were treated in first stable remission following transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight other patients with a history of transformation were treated following a subsequent recurrence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 14 of 27 patients remain alive and in remission; five are alive and free of disease at more than four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival is 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two 'early' treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, and two 'late' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at 2.8 and 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine patients having had a recurrence underwent re-biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two, histology revealed FL, in five, transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of the patients with recurrent FL is alive without further therapy, and two of five patients with recurrent FL-t are alive and in remission after further chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is appropriate to consider HDT for younger patients with FL-t in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeat biopsy should be considered for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is a risk of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in patients undergoing this treatment </plain></SENT>
