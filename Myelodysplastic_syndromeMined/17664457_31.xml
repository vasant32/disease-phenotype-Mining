<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) after adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database were used for women diagnosed with nonmetastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> from 1992 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a claim with an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (International Classification of Diseases ninth revision, codes 205 to 208), comparing patients treated with and without adjuvant chemotherapy, and by differing chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative hazard of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine factors independently associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this observational study, there were 64,715 patients: 10,130 received adjuvant chemotherapy and 54,585 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 75.6 years (range, 66 to 104 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 54.8 months (range, 13 to 144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absolute risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at 10 years after any adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was 1.8% versus 1.2% for women who had not received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with adjuvant chemotherapy versus none was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) within the first year of diagnosis did not convey a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a small but real increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study may underestimate the true incidence because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cannot be identified through claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>G-CSF use within the first year of diagnosis does not convey an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in older women </plain></SENT>
