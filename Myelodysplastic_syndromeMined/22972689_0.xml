<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the exploration of a safe and reliable strategy exclusive of chemotherapy is critical in improving the prognosis of elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells combined with recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e>, then augmented by priming with interferon gamma, rhIL-2 and CD3 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autologous CIK cells (2-3 × 10(9)) were transfused back to patients, followed by a subcutaneous injection of IL-2 (1 mU/day) for 10 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The host cellular immune function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-related biological parameters, imaging characteristics, disease condition, quality of life and survival time were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received 8 cycles of transfusion and 6 received 4 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+) CD8(+) and CD3(+) CD56(+) cells were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), and the levels of serum β2 microglobulin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) were markedly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) after autologous CIK cell transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-related symptoms were profoundly alleviated, as demonstrated by the improved quality of life (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was observed in 11 patients, persistent partial remission in 7 patients and stable disease in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, the mean survival time was 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transfusion with autologous CIK cells plus rhIL-2 treatment is safe and effective for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
