<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients have a short survival and often progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be difficult; there is a paucity of molecular markers, and the pathophysiology is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a multicenter study investigating whether serum proteome profiling may serve as a noninvasive platform to discover novel molecular markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We generated serum proteome profiles from 218 individuals by MS and identified a profile that distinguishes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cytopenias in a learning sample set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This profile was validated by testing its ability to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in a first independent validation set and a second, prospectively collected, independent validation set run 5 months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accuracy was 80.5% in the first and 79.0% in the second validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting and quadrupole TOF MS identified two differential proteins: CXC chemokine ligands 4 (CXCL4) and 7 (CXCL7), both of which had significantly decreased serum levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as confirmed with independent antibody assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses of platelet lysates for these two platelet-derived molecules revealed a lack of CXCL4 and CXCL7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subtype analyses revealed that these two proteins have decreased serum levels in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, suggesting the possibility of a concerted disturbance of transcription or translation of these chemokines in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
