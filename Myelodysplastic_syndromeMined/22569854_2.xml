<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin (SF) was measured monthly, and safety assessment included monitoring of adverse events during treatment and of liver and renal parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median SF at baseline of the 40 patients was 2,878 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was 1,125 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 12 months of treatment, there was a significant reduction in SF from baseline, the median value being 1,400 ng/ml (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interruptions due to toxicity were recorded in 40 % of patients: most common adverse events were diarrhoea (five patients, 12.5 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (four patients, 10 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased serum creatinine</z:hpo> values &gt;33 % above baseline, but there were no progressive increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (three refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and one refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts type 1) had a reduction of transfusion requirement (from a median of 5 to 1 unit/month) according to International Working Group 2006 criteria, with mean Hb value increasing from 8.5 to 10.5 g/dl, and mean Hb improvement being 2 g/dl (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No increased toxicity was noted when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was used concomitantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (eight patients who were intermediate 2 International Prognostic Scoring System risk) or lenalidomide (two patients with del(5q)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the oral iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> is effective and safe when used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with transfusion requirement, also if administered concomitantly with other drugs </plain></SENT>
