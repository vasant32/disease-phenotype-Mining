<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transfusion-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (TA-GVHD) due to blood from HLA-homozygous related and unrelated blood donors has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Fatal TA-GVHD due to the transfusion of HLA-matched platelets from an unrelated HLA-homozygous donor is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old man with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in November 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction chemotherapy resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, which was followed by a normocellular marrow with mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and continued karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy was given in a second attempt to achieve complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-matched platelets were ordered when platelet refractoriness developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was HLA-heterozygous for HLA-A and -B antigens (A2, 29; B37, 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over the next 7 days, four unirradiated HLA-matched plateletpheresis units were transfused; one was probably homozygous for both HLA-A and -B antigens (A2, -; B44, -) and was transfused first, and three were probably homozygous for an HLA-B antigen (A2, 29; B44, -) and were white cell reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No blood relatives served as donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the first HLA-matched platelet transfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> developed; 2 days later, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Liver enzymes increased markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Renal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> ensured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy was consistent with GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite immunosuppressive therapy, the patient died 19 days after the first HLA-matched platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TA-GVHD has been recognized in immunocompromised, HLA-heterozygous patients receiving blood from blood relatives who are HLA-homozygous. patients receiving blood from either blood relatives or non-blood relatives who are HLA-homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This HLA-heterozygous patient received transfusions of unirradiated, class I HLA-homozygous platelets, which were specifically ordered as HLA-matched, and his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was attributed to TA-GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Consideration should always be given to providing irradiated blood for immunosuppressed patients, especially when HLA-matched platelets are used, to prevent TA-GVHD </plain></SENT>
