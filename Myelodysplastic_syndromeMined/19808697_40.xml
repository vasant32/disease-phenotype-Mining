<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine the clinical implications of RUNX1 mutations in 470 adult patients with de novo non-M3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three distinct RUNX1 mutations were identified in 62 persons (13.2%); 32 were in N-terminal and 31, C-terminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RUNX1 mutation was closely associated with male sex, older age, lower lactic dehydrogenase value, French-American-British M0/M1 subtypes, and expression of HLA-DR and CD34, but inversely correlated with CD33, CD15, CD19, and CD56 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mutation was positively associated with MLL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e> but negatively associated with CEBPA and NPM1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with RUNX1 mutations had a significantly lower complete remission rate and shorter disease-free and overall survival than those without the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RUNX1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential analysis in 133 patients revealed that none acquired novel RUNX1 mutations during clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide evidence that RUNX1 mutations are associated with distinct biologic and clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
