<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron overload</z:e> is usually observed in patients (even untransfused) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and contributes towards the generation of low molecular weight iron complexes or non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which in turn favors oxidative DNA damage and consequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Levels of NTBI and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation were evaluated by means of free serum malondyaldehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in untransfused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and we tried to correlate them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the pattern of in vitro growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NTBI levels were found to be significantly higher in low-risk than in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, as well as in patients with a lower myeloid/erythroid ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> was found to be uniformly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as a whole than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow progenitor cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high NTBI levels showed a higher degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a leukemic growth pattern had lower NTBI levels than those with a non-leukemic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NTBI is related to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> and that it contributes towards inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of leukemic growth is associated with low NTBI levels, probably due to increased iron consumption by blast cells </plain></SENT>
