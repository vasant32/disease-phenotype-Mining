<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations have been reported in 10-15% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) but they appear to be less frequent among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study in 1,067 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for whom <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutational analysis was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 4% of patients carried mutant <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, FLT3 mutations, which were found in 2% of patients, were mutually exclusive with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations had a higher white blood cell count as well as bone marrow blasts compared with patients carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed between both groups regarding the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation (9% vs. 7%) and overall survival (395 days vs. 500 days, P = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations are infrequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and do not appear to negatively impact their outcome </plain></SENT>
