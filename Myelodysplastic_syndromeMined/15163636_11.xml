<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MYC gene at 8q24 has been reported to be amplified in the majority of the cases, and generally it has been assumed that MYC is the target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only a few studies have focused on the extent of the amplicon or on the expression patterns of the amplified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied six cases (five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with MYC-containing dmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses identified a common 4.3 Mb amplicon, with clustered proximal and distal breakpoints, harboring eight known genes (C8FW, NSE2, POU5FLC20, MYC, PVT1, AK093424, MGC27434 and MLZE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding region was deleted in one of the chromosome 8 homologues in five of the six cases, suggesting that the dmin originated through extra replication (or loop-formation)--excision--amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed that MYC was not overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, the C8FW gene, encoding a phosphoprotein regulated by mitogenic pathways, displayed increased expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results exclude MYC as the target gene and indicate that overexpression of C8FW may be the functionally important consequence of 8q24 amplicons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
