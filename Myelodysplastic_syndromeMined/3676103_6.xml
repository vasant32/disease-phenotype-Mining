<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell kinetics were studied by quantitative autoradiography in 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and in four with smouldering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (SML) in a prospective 6-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cellular turnover in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB groups was characterized by reduced labelling index and prolonged DNA synthesis time indicating reduced proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two more parameters were derived from the measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) The relative cell production rate, which is increased in proerythroblasts and myeloblasts in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This could be attributed to an increased number of divisions in early recognizable precursors in the absence of maturation, and (or) an increased influx from the progenitor compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The maturation index of a cell lineage was determined by the ratio of relative cell production rate increase from the first to the last proliferative compartment over the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It showed a high degree of abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB subgroups, indicating premature cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the kinetic parameters proved to be of value in predicting the evolution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an excellent correlation was found between the myeloid maturation index and survival (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation, however, was found between survival and the erythroid maturation index, which was relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the worst prognostic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that although in vitro cell kinetic studies can not predict the evolution of overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, the myeloid maturation index is a useful predictor of survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and SML </plain></SENT>
