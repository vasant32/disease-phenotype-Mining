<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients, including 4 complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> and 5 with AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome, 30 AA patients, including 9 being severe AA (SAA) and 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA (CAA), 27 MDS-RA patients, and 20 healthy individuals were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD(55), CD(59) and CD(87) on peripheral granulocytes were analyzed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum su-PAR was assayed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CD(55)(+), CD(59)(+) and CD(87)(+) granulocytes in peripheral blood of 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> more than 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of three kinds of GPI-APs in 22 PNH patients were significantly decreased as compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, AA patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum level of su-PAR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> group was higher than that of the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD(87) was significantly decreased in thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients as compared with that in non-thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD(87) was significantly decreased in AA patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressions of three kinds of GPI-APs in 5 AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome patients were remarkably reduced as compared with AA patients, but no significant difference was found for these indexes between AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and between 27 MDS-RA patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of CD(55), CD(59) and CD(87) expressions levels on the peripheral granulocytes and su-PAR in serum would be alternative approaches for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum level of su-PAR may be helpful to monitor <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
