<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HPRT gene detects a wide variety of mutation types, many of which are similar at the molecular level to those found in oncogenes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it remains to be determined whether the assay for mutations in T lymphocytes is reflective of mutagenic events in tissues or cells which have high frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now demonstrate that the HPRT gene can be utilized to detect mutations in myeloid stem cells, which are frequent progenitor cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This myeloid stem cell assay shows an age related increase in mutation at HPRT and also detects increases in mutant frequency (M-MF) in patients who have undergone chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myeloid mutants are confirmed to have mutations in the HPRT gene by DNA sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases in M-MF are seen as expected in the clonally unstable myeloid stem cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>; however, unexpectedly these patients also have elevated T-lymphocyte mutant frequencies (T-MF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good correlation is shown between M-MFs and T-MFs in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that the T-lymphocyte assay, which is technically much less demanding than the myeloid assay, appears to faithfully represent the frequency of mutagenic events in the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
