<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and metabolism of ara-C was examined in myeloblasts from DS and non-DS patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, DS infants with the transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DS myeloblasts were approximately 10-fold more sensitive to ara-C (measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) colorimetric sensitivity assay), compared with non-DS myeloblasts, following exposure to ara-C for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of l-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) were significantly higher in DS myeloblasts compared with non-DS myeloblasts after incubation with 5 micromol/L ara-C (621.4 v 228.4 pmol/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DS cell lines also generated higher levels of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> compared with cell lines with diploid chromosome numbers (66.5 v 13.6 pmol/mg protein and 137.6 v 41.7 pmol/mg protein at 1 and 5 micromol/L ara-C, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> levels in the DS cells were accompanied by slightly lower levels of endogenous deoxycytidine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16311">dCTP</z:chebi>) pools, slightly greater extent of ara-C incorporation into DNA, and increased relative numbers of double strand DNA strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the cell cycle distributions of DS and non-DS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These in vitro studies support our hypothesis that enhanced metabolism of ara-C in DS cells may be a contributing factor to the superior survival rate of DS children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and is possibly based on a gene dosage effect of genes localized to chromosome 21 including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-beta-synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study of the mechanisms (ie, alterations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16311">dCTP</z:chebi> pools and DNA methylation) involved may lead to improvements in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
