<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies concerning the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have shown evidences for the existence of complex interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the B-lymphocyte maturation in BM of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 41 newly-diagnosed patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enumeration and characterization of CD34+ and CD34- B-cell precursors and mature B-lymphocytes was performed using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BM from eight transplant donors and six orthopedic surgery patients were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34+/CD45(lo) B-cells were found in 17/22 patients with RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and in 5/13 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> no CD34+ B-cell precursors could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between CD34+ and CD34- B-cell precursors (r=0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34+ B-cell precursors presented an inverse correlation with BM percentage of blasts and peripheral leukocytes and a positive one with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asynchronous antigen expression (CD19+/CD79a- cells) was found in 7/11 cases of RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and 6/18 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in which this phenotype was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal patterns of expression for at least one antigen was found in 91% of RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> cases and in 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Underexpression of TdT and CD79a were the most frequent abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results present evidences of an <z:mp ids='MP_0002144'>abnormal B-cell maturation</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may be an evidence that B-lymphocytes are derived of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But it may also be the consequence of influences of abnormalities of BM microenvironment leading to an impaired commitment and maturation of the B-cell line in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Studies performed with purified well-characterized B-cells may further elucidate these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
