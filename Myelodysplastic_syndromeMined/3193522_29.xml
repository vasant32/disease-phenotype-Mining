<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 114 patients entered into the program who have been followed for a minimum of 18 months 42 per cent required treatment for high intravesical pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of this group or the larger group with low bladder pressures showed progressive upper urinary tract deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8 children (17 per cent of those with high pressure bladder dysfunction) high intravesical pressure persisted despite anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization, and they required an operation to achieve a low pressure bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the findings in other studies that about 40 per cent of myelodysplastic children are at high risk for the development of upper tract changes, and that approximately 6 to 8 per cent will not respond sufficiently to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48873">anticholinergic agents</z:chebi> and intermittent catheterization </plain></SENT>
