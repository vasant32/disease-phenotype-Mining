<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Controversy continues whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">panmyelosis</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (APMF) exists as a well-defined clinicopathological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following exclusion of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), especially the megakaryoblastic subtype, a retrospective study was performed on 46 patients with clinical and morphological features suggesting the diagnosis of APMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a bone marrow (BM) biopsy performed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and 13 had follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were applied and BM features evaluated by a semiquantitative scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> associated with a left-shifted differential count of the peripheral blood (less than 5% blasts) and no or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median survival 9 months) 35 patients developed severe BM insufficiency and 10 transformed into overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> was a characteristic finding, other BM features proved to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellularity was reduced in 13 and increased in 25 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most prominent was a left-shifted, often macrocytic erythropoiesis and a maturation defect of the neutrophil series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients an increase (less than 20%) in CD34+ progenitors, immature myelomonocytic cells, and megakaryoblasts was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of megakaryocytes (atypical microforms, clustering, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were regularly present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The stroma showed an inflammatory reaction (perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e>, lymphoid nodules, many macrophages, iron deposits) in about 50% of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sequential BM biopsies revealed an accumulation of lysozyme-expressing myelomonocytic and CD34+ progenitor cells suggesting an increase in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, APMF may not be a distinct entity, but includes hyperfibrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) either primary or secondary, a rare form of initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and even cases of toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
