<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular basis underlying their activity remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the induction and long-term stability of gene reactivation at three methylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor loci in response to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-azaCdR) in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the TMS1/ASC locus, treatment with 5-azaCdR resulted in partial DNA demethylation, the reengagement of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II (Pol II), and a shift from a repressive chromatin profile marked with H3K9me2 and H4K20me3 to an active profile enriched in H3ac and H3K4me2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a single-molecule approach coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing, we show that H3ac, H3K4me2, and Pol II selectively associated with the demethylated alleles, whereas H3K9me2 preferentially marked alleles resistant to demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H4K20me3 was unaffected by DNA demethylation and associated with both unmethylated and methylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After drug removal, TMS1 underwent partial remethylation, yet a subset of alleles remained stably demethylated for over 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These alleles remained selectively associated with H3K4me2, H3ac, and Pol II and correlated with a sustained low level of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TMS1 alleles reacquired H3K9me2 over time, and those alleles that became remethylated retained H3ac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CDH1 and ESR1 were remethylated and completely silenced within approximately 1 week of drug removal, and failed to maintain stably unmethylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the ability to maintain Pol II occupancy is a critical factor in the long-term stability of drug-induced CpG island demethylation </plain></SENT>
