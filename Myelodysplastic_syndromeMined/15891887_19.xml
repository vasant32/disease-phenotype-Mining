<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is strongly affected by chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with an isolated del(5q31) have a favourable prognosis that worsens with the addition of another chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that both patients with isolated del(5q31) and those with one single additional chromosomal abnormality achieve hematological and cytogenetic remissions with lenalidomide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether this translates into improved overall survival of the patient population is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed data of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and complex chromosomal abnormalities including del(5q31) and show that their median survival is between 7 and 8 months, irrespective of the medullary blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we present data of a patient with complex karyotypic anomalies inclusive of del(5q31) treated with lenalidomide who achieved complete cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cytogenetic remission was diagnosed after 6 months, and the hematological response is ongoing at 9 months of therapy at a dose of 5 mg p.o. daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lenalidomide has the potential to induce sustained hematological and cytogenetic remissions in the poor prognosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroup of del(5q31) patients with complex chromosomal anomalies and that this is likely to improve overall survival </plain></SENT>
