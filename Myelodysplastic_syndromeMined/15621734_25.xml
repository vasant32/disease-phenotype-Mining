<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is defined as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with a medullary blast count &lt;5% and an isolated interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, including bands q31-q33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of this disease has not yet been fully elucidated, but there is evidence that a commonly deleted region of 1.5 Mb harbors one or several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes, the loss of which being the basic event leading to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5q- deletion has been demonstrated in very early hematopoietic precursors, including CD34+CD133+ and CD34+CD38-Thyl+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysing data of 60 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> that were followed over a period of up to 28 years, we found a median age at diagnosis of 66.8 years and a female preponderance with a male to female ratio of 1:1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> is usually macrocytic and combined with low reticulocyte counts and high erythropoetin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three types of cytogenetic deletion are most prevalent: del(5)(q13q33), del(5)(q13q31) and del(5)(q22q33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> has a good prognosis with a median overall survival of 107 months at a median follow-up of 53 months, and a low probability of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase of the medullary blast count to &gt; or =5% or the addition of one karyotypic anomaly severely reduces median overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most promising therapeutic approach is the novel thalidomide analogue CC5013 that is currently evaluated in an international phase II study </plain></SENT>
