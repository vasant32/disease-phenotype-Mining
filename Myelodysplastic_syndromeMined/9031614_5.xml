<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 was detected in 55% of CD13+, 40% of GPA+, 6% of CD5+, and 5% of CD20/22+, but not in CD3+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a complementary experiment using interphase FISH on bone marrow cells sorted by flow cytometry, 13% of CD5/CD19 double-positive cells (76% purity) were found to be trisomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the existence of a small CD5-positive B-lymphoid clone as part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> process in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since CD5/19-positive cells have been proposed to be autoantibody producing, this finding might be a clue to the pathogenesis underlying the propensity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to develop immune-mediated complications </plain></SENT>
