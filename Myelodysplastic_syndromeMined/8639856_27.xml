<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the utility of marrow culture in defining the natural history and therapeutic response of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> we have studied 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated at the University of Washington before specific therapies (n = 21) or at the time of treatment failure in = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation included a medical and drug exposure history, a physical examination, a chest x-ray or computed tomography to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>, lymphocyte immunophenotype studies, anti-nuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor determinations, marrow cytogenetics, and marrow progenitor cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective Southern analyses to detect human parvovirus B19 was performed in the 27 patients for whom sera was stored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was obtained to document therapeutic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) growth (&gt;30 bursts/10(5) marrow mononuclear cells [MMNC]) in culture proved an outstanding predictor of clinical response, as 27 of 29 individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frequencies of erythroid bursts in culture responded to immunomodulating therapies (sensitivity 96%, specificity 78%, predictive value 93%, P = .0001 with two-tailed chi square analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 28 patients responded to either immunomodulating therapies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients obtained a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematocrit (complete response [CR] and 4 additional patients became transfusion independent (partial response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although responding patients often required several therapies, 20 of 24 (83%) patients who obtained a CR have sustained a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematocrit without maintenance therapy at the time of last follow-up (median 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of 8 patients with poor in vitro BFU-E growth (&lt;6 bursts/10(5) MMNC), 7 failed to respond to any therapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died (median survival time 17 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in individuals, from whom BFU-E mature appropriately in culture, immunosuppressive drugs should be used sequentially until a CR is obtained and a durable remission is the expected outcome </plain></SENT>
