<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between the fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-containing erythroblasts (F blasts) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we immunohistochemically assessed F blasts, F cells, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 137 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in the number of F blasts in the bone marrow was identified in 116 of 137 patients (84.7%), and the number of F cells was elevated in 54 patients (39.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the erythroblasts stained by anti-glycophorin C antibody, the mean percentage of F blasts was 14.63 +/- 9.17% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which was significantly higher than that in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with stress erythropoiesis (4.82 +/- 3.35%, P &lt; 0.01), although there were no significant differences in the number of F cells between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, 62 of the 137 MDS patients (45.3%) had an apparent increase in F blasts but no elevation of F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rate was significantly higher in the patients with a F blast/F cell (Fb/Fc) ratio &gt;or=5.0 than in those with a Fb/Fc ratio &lt;1.0 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that F cell precursors are incapable of maturing into functioning end-stage F cells, presumably owing to apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurement of F blasts in the bone marrow is needed for the precise evaluation of fetal-type erythropoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
