<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATRA was given at 45 mg/m2/day p.o. from week 1-12 and G-CSF at 5 micrograms/kg/day s.c. from week 5-12 with dose modifications according to the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients, predominantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During initial ATRA therapy, a bilineage response with increases of both ANC and platelet counts occurred in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During combined ATRA/G-CSF therapy, ANC increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelets increased</z:e> in three out of 14 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and a decrease in transfusion requirements occurred in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio increased during ATRA treatment and remained increased during concomitant G-CSF administration, while the maturation index of myeloid cells increased only in response to ATRA therapy, but returned to baseline during ATRA/G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated persistence of the abnormal clones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of circulating progenitor cells CFU-GM increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of the soluble TNF receptor and IL-2 receptor both increased, while TNF-alpha--already elevated prior to therapy--and soluble ICAM-1 concentrations did not significantly change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cheilosis</z:e> in most patients, and a drop in platelet counts related to G-CSF in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pilot study demonstrates that the combination treatment with ATRA/G-CSF is well tolerated, leading to normalization of ANC in most, and improvement of platelets and red blood cells in a subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
