<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NRAS mutations were detected in 6 patients(9%) at codons 12 or 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TP53 mutations were found in 10 patients(14%) in exons 4 through 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies revealed that the NRAS mutation was a late-appearing event, while the TP53 mutations were detectable at the presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patients had both NRAS and TP53 mutations, simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF1 and cFMS genes showed any mutational event among these 70 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a TP53 mutation had a significantly shorter survival time than those with an NRAS mutation or those without NRAS or TP53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, patients who showed an NRAS mutation had a shorter survival time once the mutation emerged, similar to that of patients with a TP53 mutation </plain></SENT>
