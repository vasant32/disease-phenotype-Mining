<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed cell cycle kinetics were examined following in vivo infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>--and/or bromodeoxyuridine (IUdR/BrdU), while the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was measured by in situ end labeling (ISEL) of fragmented DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are highly proliferative disorders with an equally high incidence of apoptotic intramedullary cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> accounting for the paradox of cellularity/cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By double-labeling BM biopsy sections for ISEL/BrdU we found the peculiar situation of "signal antonymy" where S-phase cells were frequently apoptotic, a phenomenon so far only seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause-effect relationship of this excessive proliferation/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is discussed at length </plain></SENT>
