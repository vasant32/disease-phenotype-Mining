<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the spleen accounted for 24 +/- 4% of platelet destruction and the liver for 15 +/- 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Untreated patients with primary AITP had increased splenic destruction (40 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001) but not hepatic destruction (13 +/- 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with untreated patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> treated patients did not have significantly different spleen and liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with secondary AITP had similar platelet counts, platelet survivals, and increases in splenic destruction of platelets as did patients with primary AITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of platelet destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AITP patients following splenectomy, the five nonresponders <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a marked increase (greater than 45%) in liver destruction compared to five responders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> less than 40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with primary or secondary AITP, there was an inverse relationship between the percent of platelets destroyed in the liver plus spleen and both the platelet count (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) and the platelet survival (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, total liver plus spleen platelet destruction, the platelet survival and the platelet turnover were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant independent predictors of the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus platelet destruction is shifted to the spleen in primary and secondary AITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failure of splenectomy is associated with a marked elevation in liver destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of spleen and liver destruction appears to be of considerable importance in the severity of the disease, as reflected in the platelet survival and platelet count </plain></SENT>
