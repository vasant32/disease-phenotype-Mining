<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 67 (range 20 to 84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a remission-induction therapy, 35 patients received low-dose chemotherapy, such as low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> infusion, and seven patients received high-dose combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete remission (CR) rates of the low-dose chemotherapy group and the high-dose combination chemotherapy group were 29% and 57%, respectively, and the overall CR rate was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival durations after induction chemotherapy of the CR group (14 cases), the partial remission (PR) group (11 cases), and non-remission (NR) group (17 cases) were 19 months, 8 months, and 3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a post-remission consolidation chemotherapy, high-dose combination chemotherapy seemed to be superior to low-dose chemotherapy judging from the median CR duration (16 months versus 4 months), but a long-term disease-free survival is hardly expected, in contrast with results in cases of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
