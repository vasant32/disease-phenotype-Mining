<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that +8 is a frequent secondary change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, cryptic--possibly primary--genetic aberrations may occur in cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as the apparently single anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no such hidden anomalies have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genome hybridization (array CGH) analysis of 10 AML/MDS cases with isolated +8, utilizing a 32K <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome array set, providing &gt;98% coverage of the genome with a resolution of 100 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Array CGH revealed intrachromosomal imbalances, not corresponding to known genomic copy number polymorphisms, in 4/10 cases, comprising nine duplications and hemizygous deletions ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.2 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 1.8 Mb deletion at 7p14.1, which had occurred prior to the +8, was identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transforming to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a deletion including ETV6 was present in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining seven imbalances involved more than 40 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results show that cryptic genetic abnormalities are frequent in <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases and that +8 as the sole cytogenetic aberration is not always the primary genetic event </plain></SENT>
