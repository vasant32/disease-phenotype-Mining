<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with chromosome 5 abnormalities and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> have a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that increasing doses of lenalidomide may benefit this group of patients by inhibiting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for del(5q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at diagnosis or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> and not eligible for standard therapy (16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 12 with intermediate-risk 2 or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) were enrolled in this prospective phase II multicenter trial and treated with lenalidomide up to 30 mg daily for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had isolated del(5q), six had del(5q) plus one additional aberration, 14 had del(5q) and a complex karyotype, four had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5, and one had del(5q) identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major and minor cytogenetic responses, assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, were achieved in 5/26 (19%) and 2/26 (8%) patients, respectively, who received one or more dose of lenalidomide, while two patients achieved only a bone marrow response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients (35%) and nine of the ten who completed the 16 weeks of trial responded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the International Working Group criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> the overall response rate in treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was 20% (3/15), while that for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was 36% (4/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients stopped therapy due to progressive disease and nine because of complications, most of which were disease-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rates were similar in patients with isolated del(5q) and in those with additional aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients with TP53 mutations responded less well than those without mutations (2/13 versus 5/9, respectively; P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No responses were observed among 11 cases with deleterious TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for higher doses of lenalidomide in poor prognosis patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with deletion 5q </plain></SENT>
