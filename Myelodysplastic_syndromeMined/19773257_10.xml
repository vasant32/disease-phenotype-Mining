<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of lenalidomide treatment on the reserves and functional characteristics of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor/precursor cells, bone marrow stromal cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with low/intermediate-1 risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the number and clonogenic potential of bone marrow erythroid/myeloid/megakaryocytic progenitor cells using clonogenic assays, the apoptotic characteristics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression of CD34(+) cells by flow cytometry, the hematopoiesis-supporting capacity of bone marrow stromal cells using long-term bone marrow cultures and the number and activation status of peripheral blood lymphocytes in ten patients with low/intermediate-1 risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with del(5q) receiving lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to baseline, lenalidomide treatment significantly decreased the proportion of bone marrow CD34+ cells, increased the proportion of CD36(+)/GlycoA(+) and CD36(-)/GlycoA(+) erythroid cells and the percentage of apoptotic cells within these cell compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment significantly improved the clonogenic potential of bone marrow erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic colony-forming cells and increased the proportion of CD34(+) cells expressing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules CD11a, CD49d, CD54, CXCR4 and the SLAM antigen CD48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematopoiesis-supporting capacity of bone marrow stroma improved significantly following treatment, as demonstrated by the number of colony-forming cells and the level of stromal-derived factor-1 alpha and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 in long-term bone marrow culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide treatment also increased the proportion of activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of lenalidomide in patients with lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with del(5q) is associated with significant increases in the proportion of bone marrow erythroid precursor cells and in the frequency of clonogenic progenitor cells, a substantial improvement in the hematopoiesis-supporting potential of bone marrow stroma and significant alterations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> profile of bone marrow CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
