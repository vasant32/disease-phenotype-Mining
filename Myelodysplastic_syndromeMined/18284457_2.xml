<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eight adult patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from marrow biopsies in the 76-month period before April 2006 were retrospectively included in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of this cohort was 70 years, with skewing of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 42% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 48 months, and secondary transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> was seen in 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival, according to the World Health Organization subtypes in ascending order, was refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblast, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System score stratified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients into different risk groups and effectively discriminated significantly different survivals, ranging from a median 4 months for high-risk patients to 72 months for low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> database provides useful information regarding the disease characteristics and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in South Australia and confirms the prognostic usefulness of the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The future prospective collection of results will be invaluable in evaluating the effect of novel therapies on patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
