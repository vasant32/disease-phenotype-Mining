<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the outcome of patients &gt; or = 60 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) treated uniformly with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> containing induction and modified high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> containing postremission therapy, and to identify factors predictive of complete disease remission (CR) and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2002, the authors treated 117 newly diagnosed patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> excluded) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> &gt; or = 60 years (median, 67 years; range, 60-82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype (Medical Research Council classification) at diagnosis was categorized as good risk (n = 3), intermediate risk (n = 69), adverse risk (n = 26), and suboptimal/not done (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype was seen in 41 patients and 40 (34%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The outcome of induction included the following: CR, 62 (53%); early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 5 (4%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, 14 (12%); and resistant disease, 36 (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3-16%) and 17% (95% CI, 9-29%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, cytogenetics, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, leukocyte count, and performance status were the significant factors for EFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age was not a significant prognostic factor for either CR or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, adverse-risk cytogenetics, previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e>, and high leukocyte count (&gt; 30 x 10(9)/L) were independent adverse prognostic factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of adverse karyotype on EFS and OS was time dependent and was observed after 50 and 150 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that candidacy for intensive therapy in older patients should be based on biologic features of disease and fitness, rather than on age </plain></SENT>
