<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e> were found to have abnormalities involving the long arm of chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, the structural rearrangements involved both bands 3q21 and 3q26 and included t(3;3) (four patients), inv(3) (three patients), and ins(5;3) (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, seven of these eight patients had platelet counts above 100,000 per microliter, five had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated platelet counts</z:e>, and four had significantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated platelet counts</z:e> (600,000 to 1,731,000 per microliter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each of the eight cases, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated platelet counts</z:e> were associated with marked abnormalities of megakaryocytopoiesis, including <z:mp ids='MP_0008254'>increased numbers of megakaryocytes</z:mp> and numerous micromegakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classification within the French-American-British system was difficult in most of these cases; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in five of the eight patients with abnormalities of chromosome 3 that involved both bands 3q21 and 3q26 was classified as M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining six of the 14 patients had translocations between chromosome 3 and another chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None involved both bands 3q21 and 3q26, and a break in either q21 or q26 was noted in only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the six, who had ANLL (M4) with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count, had a 3;5 translocation which involved band 3q25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in patients with ANLL, abnormalities of chromosome 3 which simultaneously involve bands 3q21 and 3q26 are associated with unusually high platelet counts </plain></SENT>
