<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of 11q23 abnormalities does not always correlate with that of MLL gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared the occurrence of 11q23 abnormalities (measured by karyotyping) and MLL gene rearrangement (measured by Southern blotting) in bone marrow from 311 consecutive adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11q23 abnormalities were found in 18 patients (5.8%), of whom 7 (39%) did not have the MLL gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLL gene rearrangement was detected in 35 patients (11.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 35 patients, only 11 (31%) had cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had 11q23 abnormalities or MLL gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11q23 abnormalities were associated with shorter survival than was a diploid karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both cytogenetic and molecular studies should be performed to detect 11q23 abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
