<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>NPM1 is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein, the gene for which maps to chromosome 5q35 in close proximity to a commonly deleted region associated with (del)5q, a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region is also a frequent target of deletions in de novo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that Npm1(+/-) mice develop an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-like disease that transforms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better understand the mechanism by which NPM1 haploinsufficiency causes an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phenotype, we generated factor-dependent myeloid cell lines from the bone marrow of Npm1(+/+) and Npm1(+/-) mice and demonstrated compromised neutrophil-specific gene expression in the MNPM1(+/-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attribute these observations to increased levels of the shorter, dominant negative leukemogenic isoform (p30) of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that this increase is caused, in part, by elevated levels of the activated translation initiation factor eIF4E, overexpression of which also increases translation of C/EBPαp30 in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a positive feedback loop, eIF4E expression is further elevated both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels by C/EBPαp30 but not by the full-length C/EBPαp42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Re-expression of C/EBPαp42 or NPM1 but not C/EBPαp30 in MNPM1(+/-) cells partially rescues the myeloid phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that the aberrant feed-forward pathway that keeps eIF4E and C/EBPαp30 elevated in NPM1(+/-) cells contributes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phenotype associated with NPM1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
