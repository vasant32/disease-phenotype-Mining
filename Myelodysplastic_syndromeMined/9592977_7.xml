<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In cell lines, there is an ongoing debate about the role of the lung resistance-related protein (LRP) whereas the role played by P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (PGP) in determining a multidrug resistance is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the role of a PGP and an LRP overexpression in affecting the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> accumulation (IDA) and in predicting the therapy outcome on a subset of overt secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (ANLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An adjunctive point was to evaluate the efficacy of the reversal agent SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) in counteracting impaired IDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: By flow cytometry, PGP and LRP expression and the IDA were evaluated on 54 overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary ANLL</z:e> PGP and LRP overexpressions were respectively defined by an MRK-16 mean fluorescence index (MFI) &gt; or = 6 (PGP+) and by an LRP-56 MFI &gt; or = 5 i.e. by MRK-16 and LRP-56 MFIs higher than the one observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blasts' IDA was studied after a two-hour incubation in 1000 ng/mL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> in the presence or in the absence of the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> reversal agent SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) 1.6 mumol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A PGP overexpression was detected in 40/54 (74%) cases while an LRP overexpression was observed on 33/54 (61%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in terms of PGP and LRP expressions between ANLL developing after chemo/radiotherapy (therapy-related ANLL) or evolving from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related ANLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the PGP-, the PGP+ cases showed a significantly lower mean IDA (DNR NMFI 196 +/- 46 vs. 267 +/- 53, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The co-incubation of DNR with the PSC significantly increased only the mean IDA of the PGP+ cases, that grew from a DNR NMFI of 196 +/- 46 to a DNR NMFI of 284 +/- 67 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocytes, even the PGP- cases had an impaired IDA suggesting that other mechanisms, including an LRP overexpression, could affect the IDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A strongly negative correlation was observed between PGP overexpression and therapy outcome, in fact, 8/10 (80%) PGP- but only 2/27 (7%) PGP+ patients obtained complete remission (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 7/33 (21%) cases showing an impaired IDA (NMFI &lt; 280) but 4/4 (100%) with NMFI &gt; 280 had complete remission (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between therapy response and LRP or CD34 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that an important role in determining therapy outcome is played by PGP in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Even if the LRP is frequently overexpressed in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and is likely to contribute to the reduction of the intracellular drug accumulation, the role played by LRP in determining the therapy-outcome has still to be cleared </plain></SENT>
