<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because of limited reproducibility of morphologic features, the morphological categorization of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases remains a major task in a diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further evaluate the role of additional diagnostic methods for suspected early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the authors analyzed 1965 cases with unclear cytopenia where at least cytomorphology and immunophenotyping were performed in parallel, combined with cytogenetics and molecular genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 353 patients, both methods diagnosed malignant/nonmalignant disease other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 557 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 1055 patients (53.7%), where early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/reactive cytopenia had to be assumed, were categorized into 6 groups depending on cytomorphology/immunophenotyping results for or against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 659 of 1055 cases (62.4%) with suspected initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, cytomorphology and immunophenotyping were concordant in the categorization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics, available in 951 of 1055 patients, revealed the highest frequency of aberrant karyotypes when both cytomorphology and immunophenotyping proposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (63 of 227; 27.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But also in the groups where either cytomorphology or immunophenotyping showed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, aberrant karyotypes were found in 6% to 14% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even when both <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping showed no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 11 of 208 (5.3%) had cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RUNX1/AML1 mutation screening was positive in 15% in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NRAS, MLL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>, NPM1, and JAK2V617F were detected in low frequencies, confirming <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis in the respective cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report outlines the power of a combined diagnostic approach for suspected initial cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> including immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics with selected markers in addition to cytomorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic algorithms should be developed, and immunophenotyping should be further validated for this specific indication </plain></SENT>
