<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During rejection of a male stem cell graft by a female recipient, 2 male (H-Y)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were isolated from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One CTL clone recognized an HLA-A2-restricted H-Y antigen, encoded by the SMCY gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another CTL clone recognized an HLA-B60-restricted H-Y antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study UTY was identified as the gene coding for the HLA-B60-restricted H-Y antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The UTY-derived H-Y antigen was characterized as a 10-amino acid residue <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, RESEEESVSL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> differed by 3 amino acids from its X-homologue, UTX, only 2 polymorphisms were essential for recognition by the CTL clone HLA-B60 HY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results illustrate that CTLs against several H-Y antigens derived from different proteins can contribute simultaneously to graft rejection after HLA-identical, sex-mismatched SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RESEEESVSL-specific T cells could be isolated from a female HLA-B60+ patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who has been treated with multiple blood transfusions, but not from control healthy HLA-B60+ female donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that RESEEESVSL-reactive T cells are more common in sensitized patients </plain></SENT>
