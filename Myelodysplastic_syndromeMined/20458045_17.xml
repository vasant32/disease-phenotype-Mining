<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who have extensive axillary lymph node involvement have a poor prognosis after conventional adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared intense dose-dense (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>) adjuvant chemotherapy with conventionally scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, phase III trial, a total of 1,284 eligible patients with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e> sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>, paclitaxel, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>-ETC) every 2 weeks or conventionally scheduled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> followed by paclitaxel every three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 62 months, 5-year event-free survival rates were 62% in the conventional arm and 70% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>-ETC arm, representing a 28% reduction of the relative risk of relapse (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This benefit was independent of menopausal, hormone receptor, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rates were 77% versus 82%, representing a 24% reduction of the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = .0285) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e> therapy was associated with significantly more nonhematologic and hematologic toxicities, but no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>-ETC arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>-ETC was less well tolerated compared with conventional chemotherapy but significantly improved event-free and overall survivals in patients with high-risk primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who had four or more positive axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
