<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the megakaryocytic alterations in the bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> in cases of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND DESIGN: A prospective study of 144 bone marrow aspirates was conducted in the department of pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aspirates were studied to assess the number and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the megakaryocytes in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and evaluate their significance when compared to changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> smears were stained with Leishman stain and examined under light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical Analysis Used: Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity was calculated for those features which were significant in the relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: The sensitivity of immature megakaryocytes, dysplastic forms and micromegakaryocytes in cases of immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> was 100%, 89% and 42% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The specificity of emperipolesis was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, immature megakaryocytes had a sensitivity of 100% and cytoplasmic vacuolization were 86% specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the dysplastic forms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, no platelet budding was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of micromegakaryocyte had a specificity of 83% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and was statistically significant when compared to cases of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> conditions (P 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Careful understanding of the morphological changes of megakaryocytes in bone marrow aspirates can improve the diagnostic accuracy for a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> thereby enabling proper therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
