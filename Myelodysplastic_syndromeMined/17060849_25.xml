<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effect of natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity on outcome of unrelated stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recognize human leukocyte antigen C and B <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on target cells, thereby regulating NK cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The KIR genes are polymorphic and two broad haplotypes exist: KIR-haplotype A mainly encode for inhibitory receptors and only for one activating (KIR2DS4), whereas the group B haplotype encodes more for activating KIRs (KIR2DS1, KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, KIR2DS5 und KIR3DS1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The impact of KIR ligand mismatch on the number of activating and inhibitory donor KIR genes and on KIR-haplotype was studied on outcome of 142 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, who received standard myeloablative conditioning followed by in vivo T-cell depleted (ATG) unrelated SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis KIR ligand mismatch had significantly higher treatment related mortality (RR 2.206, P = 0.03), resulting in reduced overall (RR 2.015, P = 0.02) and disease-free survival (RR 1.924, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SCT from donors with group A haplotype (P = 0.003) or with low number of activating KIR genes (P = 0.005) resulted in reduced relapse rate with improved disease-fee survival (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was seen only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and to a less extent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect was seen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After in vivo T-cell depleted (ATG) unrelated stem cell transplantation with donors carrying low number of activating KIR genes (group A KIR haplotype), the risk of relapse is reduced and resulted in a significantly better disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
