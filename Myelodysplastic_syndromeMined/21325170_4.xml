<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an open-label, single-center pilot study, 30 pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignant (n = 16) and nonmalignant (n = 14) disorders received treatment with a ⁹⁰Y-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high risk of relapse (n = 7) received additional treatment with standard conditioning based on either total body irradiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> to intensify the antileukemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with comorbidities (n = 23), radioimmunotherapy was combined with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to reduce systemic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preferential irradiation of the bone marrow was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality was 4 (13%) of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with malignant diseases, the probabilities of overall and disease-free survival at 2 years were 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.37-0.87) and 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.19-0.70), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with nonmalignant diseases, the probability of both overall and disease-free survival at 2 years was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pilot study demonstrates that radioimmunotherapy is effective in achieving myeloablation with low additional toxicity when used in combination with standard or reduced-intensity conditioning in young patients </plain></SENT>
