<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemopoietic suppression in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) has been associated with aberrant IFN-gamma, increased TNF-beta expression, and elevated numbers of activated cytotoxic T-cells in marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now examined Fas antigen expression in fresh AA BM samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals few CD34+ cells expressed Fas antigen and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells had low sensitivity to Fas-mediated inhibition of colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in early AA, BM CD34+ cells showed markedly increased percentages of Fas receptor-expressing CD34+ cells, which correlated with increased sensitivity of AA marrow cells to anti-Fas antibody-mediated inhibition of colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Fas antigen-bearing cells was lower in recovered patients' BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fas antigen was also detected in the marrow of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, especially the hypocellular variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that AA CD34+ cells, probably including haemopoietic progenitor cells, express high levels of Fas receptor due to in vivo exposure to IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha and are suitable targets for T-cell-mediated killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the Fas receptor/Fas ligand system are involved in the pathophysiology of BM failure </plain></SENT>
