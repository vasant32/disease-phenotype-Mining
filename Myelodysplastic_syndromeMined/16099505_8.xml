<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, factors such as high bone marrow cellularity and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase levels have been associated with an adverse outcome, spontaneously and after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, increased bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, measured as, e.g. microvascular density (MVD), was reported to be more intense in high-risk than in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the prognostic role of MVD in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a cohort of 56 patients, thoroughly investigated for various clinical and morphological parameters, were followed-up for survival &gt; or =60 months after the diagnostic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had higher MVD compared to healthy controls (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest median MVD value was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> group, but there was no overall significant difference between the FAB groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were observed between MVD and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, percentage of bone marrow blasts and CD34 positive cells, apoptotic index (TUNEL), proliferation index (MIB-1), erythroid index, FAB group and IPSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MVD was not correlated to overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bone marrow blast count &lt;5%, low or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellularity, as well as a high erythroid index, indicated a favorable survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data do not support an important prognostic role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, reflected by microvessel density, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
