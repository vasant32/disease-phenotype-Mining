<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of ATG in the treatment of 96 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for duration of response to ATG, as well as survival after administration of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19-75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8-133 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6-92 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, both low International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and bone marrow (BM) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to ATG (IPSS Int-2/high: odds ratio (OR) 0.08, P=0.018 and BM normo/hypercellularity: OR 0.49, P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, IPSS was the sole predictor of overall survival, with Int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (OR 0.08, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study identifies BM hypocellularity and a low IPSS as important factors predicting response to ATG </plain></SENT>
