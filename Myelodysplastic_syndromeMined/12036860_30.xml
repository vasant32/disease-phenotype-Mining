<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) in 51 patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), refectory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (RA) with excess of blasts in transformation, or RA with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> was given in doses of 9 mg/m(2) of body-surface area on days 1 and 8 or, therapeutically equivalently, on days 1 and 15, with or without interleukin 11 (IL-11; 15 microg/kg per day on days 3 to 28), with assignment to IL-11 treatment made randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) rates were 2 of 26 (8%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> without IL-11 and 9 of 25 (36%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with IL-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses indicated that IL-11 was independently predictive of CR but not survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (IA), as previously administered, in similar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CR rate with IA was 15 of 31 (48%), and survival was superior with IA compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 (P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides accounting for possible covariate effects on outcome, we also accounted for possible trial effects (TEs) arising because IA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 were not arms of a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bayesian posterior probabilities that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 produced longer survival than IA, after accounting for covariates and TEs, were less than 0.01 in patients with abnormal cytogenetic findings (AC) and less than 0.15 in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic findings (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding CR, the analogous probabilities were less than 0.02 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> without IL-11 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytogenetic groups), and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with IL-11, less than 0.25 for AC groups and about 0.50 for NC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TEs 2 to 5 times the magnitude of those previously observed would be needed to conclude that survival with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 is likely longer than with IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is little evidence to suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> with or without IL-11 should be used instead of IA in older patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
