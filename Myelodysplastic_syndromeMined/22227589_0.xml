<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, sometimes unexpectedly poor CD34(+) cell yields are obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect, if any, of a range of factors on the ability of the PB CD34(+) count to predict collection CD34(+) cell count, we performed a retrospective analysis on consecutive hematopoietic progenitor cell apheresis collections between 2004 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors investigated included mobilization regimen, PB white blood cell count, body weight, and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of collections involving apheresis complications, a total of 1,225 PB CD34(+) cell results with corresponding collection CD34(+) cell results from 458 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although differences in the median PB CD34(+) cell counts and collection CD34(+) cell counts were seen between mobilized collections with chemotherapy plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and those with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone, the predictive capability of the PB CD34(+) cell count for the collection CD34(+) cell yield remained similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although poorer collection efficiencies were observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> diagnostic subgroup, our findings confirm that PB CD34(+) cell analysis remains a powerful and irreplaceable tool for predicting hematopoietic progenitor cell apheresis CD34(+) cell yield </plain></SENT>
