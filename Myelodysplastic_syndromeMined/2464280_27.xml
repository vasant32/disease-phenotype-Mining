<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The expansion of an abnormal hemopoietic stem cell line is responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, which are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenias</z:hpo>, often resulting in lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cloned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was recently shown to enhance the growth and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte progenitor cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine the effects of recombinant human G-CSF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and one patient with smoldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> following the occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> received recombinant human G-CSF by intravenous infusion for six days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received different dosage levels (50 to 1,600 micrograms/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A response was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with an increase in both immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose levels that could stimulate granulocytopoiesis differed among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, at least in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> can be improved by G-CSF, although it still remains to be determined whether the increase in the number of granulocytes is due to the differentiation and maturation of the myelodysplastic clone or restoration of a residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clone </plain></SENT>
