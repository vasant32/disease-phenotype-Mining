<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signals from the microenvironment support leukemic cell survival and proliferation and may confer chemotherapy resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ON 01910.Na (Rigosertib), a multikinase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, is entering phase III trials for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ON 01910.Na against CLL cells in vitro and investigate the molecular effects of this drug on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytotoxicity of ON 01910.Na against CLL cells from 34 patients was determined in vitro with flow cytometry of cells stained with Annexin V and CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global gene expression profiling on Affymetrix microarrays, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cocultures with stroma cells were used to delineate ON 01910.Na mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ON 01910.Na induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CLL B cells without significant toxicity against T cells or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ON 01910.Na was equally active against leukemic cells associated with a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> course [immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region unmutated, adverse cytogenetics] than against cells without these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling revealed two main mechanisms of action: PI3K/AKT inhibition and induction of ROS that resulted in an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> response through activating protein 1 (AP-1), c-jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, and ATF3 culminating in the upregulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ROS scavengers and shRNA mediated knockdown of ATF3- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi>-protected cells from drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ON 01910.Na also abrogated the prosurvival effect of follicular dendritic cells on CLL cells and reduced SDF-1-induced migration of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the clinical development of ON 01910.Na in CLL </plain></SENT>
