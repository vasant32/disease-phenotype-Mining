<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analog used in the treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The compound requires intracellular conversion to its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> to become active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> has, however, never been quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This article describes a method for the quantitative determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> in PBMCs using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to ex vivo incubated whole blood samples and samples from three patients receiving prolonged low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We successfully quantitated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> in PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considerable levels were detected in PBMCs from two patients that responded well to therapy, whereas only low levels were present in a non-responding patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the data show that, in contrast to plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> accumulates during a treatment cycle of nine infusions at a dose of 15Â mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> levels and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the observed accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> during a treatment cycle, a less intensive dose scheme could be feasible </plain></SENT>
