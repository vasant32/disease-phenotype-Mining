<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 257 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 106 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 97 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 353 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 95 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (101/813; 12.4%) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
