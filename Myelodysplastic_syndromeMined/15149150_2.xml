<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients belonging to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) subtype are usually treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients respond to EPO administration and they are strictly dependent on supportive therapy with red cell blood (RBC) transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an alternative combination regimen containing EPO, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7466">nandrolone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27689">decanoate</z:chebi>, in patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients, 4 women and 6 men, median age: 70 years (range: 55-78 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> unresponsive to EPO administration and RBC transfusion-dependent were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median hematological data at baseline were Hb: 8.7 g/dl, (range 6.2-9.8), WBC: 3.35x10(9)/l (range 2.1-4), PLT: 82.5x10(9)/l (range 59-110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPO 150 U/Kg three times/week subcutaneously, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> 8 mg/day orally and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7466">nandrolone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27689">decanoate</z:chebi> (Decadurabolin) 50 mg two-times/week intramuscularly were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As complete response (CR) to treatment was considered the normalization of the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As partial response (PR) was considered increase in Hb level &gt; or = 2 g/dl, or up to 10 g/dl and discontinuation of RBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response to therapy was evaluated on the 4th week after the initiation of the combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow smear evaluation was carried out at baseline and every six months afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved PR and discontinued RBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median and range hematological values on the 4th week after treatment initiation were Hb: 11.2 g/dl, (range: 9.8-12.8), WBC: 4.4x10(9)/l (3.5-6.6), PLT: 130x10(9)/l (95-160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increase observed in hematological values was significant (p = 0.0001, 0.0004 and &lt; 0.0001, respectively, for Hb, WBC and PLT counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two women, on treatment with the combination regimen, achieved CR one after six months and the second after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They are alive after 5 years from initiation of the combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After a median period of 18 months (range 12 to 20 months) in PR three men developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; they received intensive antileukemic chemotherapy without any response and died during the phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Three other men achieved CR, one after 6 and two after 12 months of therapy and they are on regular follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Two women after 10 and 14 months in PR developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and died </plain></SENT>
