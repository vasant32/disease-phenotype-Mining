<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF or placebo was given subcutaneously once daily at a dose of 250 micrograms/m2 starting 48 h prior to chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This design allowed us to investigate the role of GM-CSF as a priming factor for the leukemic clone, as well as its effect on the recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients are currently evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients reached a complete remission (36%), eight patients had persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (29%), and ten patients died within 6 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infectious complications during cytopenia were the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (8/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to complete hematologic recovery (neutrophils &gt; 500/microliter and platelets 20,000/microliter) and time to neutrophil recovery above 1500/microliter was 29 and 35 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median remission duration was 190 days (6.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of prognostic subgroups showed a low CR rate (25%) and a high early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (44%) in patients &gt; 55 years of age, suggesting that the intensified treatment approach should be limited to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No data concerning the influence of GM-CSF on response to chemotherapy or duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> are presently available </plain></SENT>
