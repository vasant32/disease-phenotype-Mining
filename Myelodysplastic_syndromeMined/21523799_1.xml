<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The financial impact of IC on health-care systems is predicted through economic modeling, but an analysis based on actual prevalence is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated the potential drug-costs and need for IC in a cohort of 189 United Kingdom-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with low or intermediate-1 IPSS scores were identified as eligible for IC if ≥24 red cell units (RCU) had been transfused over 12 consecutive months or the transfusion-intensity averaged ≥2 RCU per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug-costs were calculated from the time patients qualified for IC until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 159 patients with low/intermediate-1 MDS, survival was superior with a low IPSS score (P = 0.014), age &lt;70 years (P = 0.043), transfusion-independence at diagnosis (P = 0.0056) and transfusion-intensity of &lt;2 RCU per month (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflecting the time elapsed since diagnosis, longer survival was observed with a cumulative red cell load of ≥75 U (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By logistic-regression analysis, transfusion-intensity independently predicted survival (P = 0.0035) in low and intermediate-1 risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients fulfilled criteria for consideration of IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 6 patients died within 1 month; 35 patients survived for a median of 16 months (range 1-61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Had patients commenced IC, the anticipated drug-costs alone would have been ~$526,880-$2,064,800 over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lack of association between cumulative transfusion-load and survival calls for a prospective evaluation of the cost-utility of IC in patients surviving long-term, to enable evidence-based recommendations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> management </plain></SENT>
