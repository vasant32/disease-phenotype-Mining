<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated survival patterns for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registered <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients diagnosed in Sweden in 1973 to 2005 (N = 9729; median age, 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into 6 age groups and 4 calendar periods (1973-1980, 1981-1988, 1989-1996, and 1997-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative survival ratios were computed as measures of patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-year survival improved over time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, whereas 5- and 10-year survival improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, except for patients 80+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year relative survival ratios in the last calendar period were 0.65, 0.58, 0.36, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.01 for the age groups 0 to 18, 19 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80, and 80+ years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensified chemotherapy, a continuous improvement in supportive care, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are probably the most important factors contributing to this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no improvement in survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with a prior diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> during 1993 to 2005 (n = 219) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> survival has improved during the last decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients die of their disease and age remains an important predictor of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New effective agents with a more favorable toxicity profile are needed to improve survival, particularly in the elderly </plain></SENT>
