<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report the detection, by conventional cytogenetic methods, of a cytogenetically identical t(X;20) in two different patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> (probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases, this translocation appeared as the primary clonal chromosome abnormality, with breakpoints occurring in the long arms of both the X chromosome and chromosome 20 (Xq13.1 and 20q13.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further characterization and comparison of the translocation chromosome products of these two cases by use of fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques is also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar previously reported cytogenetically cases and the potential that this specific rearrangement may represent a nonrandom chromosomal finding are discussed </plain></SENT>
