<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> commonly occur in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in subtypes with a low risk of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed for the first time that the numbers of CD3(+) CD4(+) IL-17 producing T cells (Th17) were markedly increased in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship between the numbers of Th17 cells and naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(high) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Th17:Tregs ratio was significantly higher in low risk disease (P &lt; 0.005) compared with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and was correlated with increased bone marrow (BM) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tregs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients suppressed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by effector CD4(+) T cells but had no effect on interleukin (IL)-17 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the serum levels of IL-7, IL-12, RANTES and IFN-gamma are significantly elevated in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while inhibitory factors, such as IL-10 and soluble IL-2 receptor, are significantly higher in high risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 'unfavourable' Th17:Tregs ratio in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may explain the higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and the improved response to immune suppression in patients with low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to those with high risk disease </plain></SENT>
