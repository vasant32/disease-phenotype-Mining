<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These advances have been accompanied by a concern for secondary primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (SPMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been known for decades that extended therapy with alkylating chemotherapy agents, such as melphalan, carries an increased risk of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), with a cumulative risk as high as 10-15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support became widely accepted for <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> in the 1990s </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, lenalidomide has come under scrutiny for its possible association with SPMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is too soon to declare a causal relationship at this time, but there appears to be an increased number of SPMs in reports from several studies using lenalidomide maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current studies should be amended and future studies planned to better define the risk of SPMs and the risk factors and mechanisms for its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients should be educated regarding this potential concern but the current use of lenalidomide should not generally be altered until further data are available </plain></SENT>
