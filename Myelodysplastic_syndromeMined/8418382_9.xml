<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blast cell colony formation from seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (NBM) samples was studied in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blast cell colonies were formed in 7/8 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the numbers not significantly differing from those generated by NBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast the more mature hematopoietic progenitors (granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony-forming unit, CFU-GEMM; erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E; granulocyte colony-forming units, CFU-G; eosinophilic colony-forming units, CFU-Eo) were severely depressed in numbers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After replating of blast cell colonies in secondary cultures, colonies were obtained in 5/8 MDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A marked difference was evident in the composition of the secondary colonies between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas secondary colonies derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast cell colonies consisted of about 45% of erythroid cells, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blast colonies generated mainly colonies of the granulocytic-monocytic lineage and no erythroid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> quantitative level of CFU-blast progenitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the context of their impaired ability to generate lineage specific progeny upon secondary plating suggests that the incompetence of maturation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may reside in the CFU-blast progenitor cell being incapable of properly responding to growth factor stimulation </plain></SENT>
