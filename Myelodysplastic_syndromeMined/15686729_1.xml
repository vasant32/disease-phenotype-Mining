<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 103 patients who received allogeneic SCT (stem cell transplants) was performed to define the incidence and outcomes of Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (73.8%) and 29 patients (28.2%), nonmyeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up of 9 months, Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were observed in 10 patients (9.7%) at a median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 32 days posttransplantation (range, 2-102 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causative organisms were identified in 5 cases, including Staphylococcus species (n=4) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six events were successfully resolved with antibiotic treatment, whereas the other 4 events required the removal of the Hickman catheters with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival duration for the Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group was shorter than that for the Hickman no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group (83 days vs 366 days, respectively; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myeloid engraftment was delayed in the Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group (18.0 days vs 15.0 days, respectively; P=.038), plus Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were more frequent among BMT compared with PBSCT group (22.2% vs 5.3%, respectively, P=.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were associated with TRM, especially during the first 3 months posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, the current results emphasize both the importance of Hickman catheter care and the need for surveillance cultures after SCT </plain></SENT>
