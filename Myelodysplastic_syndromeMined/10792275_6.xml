<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the malignant potentiality of AISA has always been a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In different series, median survival and rates of transformation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) varied extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On cytomorphological grounds, AISA can be divided into pure (dyserythropoietic) sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (PSA), in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is confined to erythropoietic cells, and a true myelodysplastic form (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), which is characterized by additional dysplastic features of granulopoiesis and/or megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, based on retrospective analysis of 94 patients with AISA, we found that both types of sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> differed considerably in terms of survival and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Almost identical results have now been obtained through a prospective study of 232 new patients with AISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in survival between PSA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> remained significant over the whole period of follow-up (survival after 3 years being 77% vs. 56%; P = 0.003), and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> did not increase with time in the PSA group, even in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This prospective study strongly supported our conclusion that cytomorphological distinction between PSA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> provides valuable prognostic information </plain></SENT>
