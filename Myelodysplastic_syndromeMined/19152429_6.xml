<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the years, different therapeutic strategies have been adopted to optimize the clinical benefits of EPO in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the current meta-analysis of published literature, erythroid response (ER) rates with EPO as a single agent versus its combination with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The assessment indicated that the ER rates were comparable between the 2 EPO-based therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EPO monotherapy at a higher dose of 60,000 to 80,000 U weekly produced significantly higher ER rates (64.5%) compared with the standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> dose of 30,000 to 40,000 U weekly either as a single agent (49%; P &lt; .001) or in combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF (50.6% P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, when transfusion-dependent patients were assessed separately, both EPO monotherapy and its combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF produced comparable and appreciable levels of transfusion independence (28.8% and 24.8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the current meta-analysis, higher doses of EPO demonstrated better ER rates compared with EPO at standard doses alone or in combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors concluded that prospective clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the use of higher doses of EPO in anemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
