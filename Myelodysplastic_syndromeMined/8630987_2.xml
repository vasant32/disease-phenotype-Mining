<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint in chromosome 1 appeared to map to q12 and not to q21, as has been described in previous reports without FISH confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 4 years before this transition the patient was polycythemic and, accordingly, treated with phlebotomy and three short courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic picture observed has been described before in seven patients: three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and one with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5/7 cases, like in our patient, the abnormality was observed during transition of the disease into either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
