<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluate the long-term results of a randomized clinical trial in patients with advanced stages (III and IV) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using chemotherapy or combined therapy (chemotherapy following by adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with nodal bulky disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1981 and 1995, patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with combined chemotherapy, mostly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens; patients who achieved complete response were randomly assigned either to receive adjuvant radiotherapy to sites or to nodal bulky disease or not (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-nine patients were randomized; in an intent-to-treat analysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actuarial curves at 20yr showed that event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in the control group were 41% [95% confidence interval (CI) 36-56%) and 71% (95% CI 65-78%), respectively; these were statistically different from results for the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy: 68% (95% CI 62-72%) and 89% (95% CI 79-96%), respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and late toxicity were minimal; only four patients (&lt;1%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac toxicity was 2%, but one case was lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients (8%) died secondary to unrelated causes, in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increases EFS and OS with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We feel that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be treated curatively because &lt;80% of patients will be in first complete response at &lt;20yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of adjuvant radiotherapy will be considered in the first line of treatment in this set of patients </plain></SENT>
