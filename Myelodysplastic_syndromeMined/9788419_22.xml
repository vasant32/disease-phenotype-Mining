<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, concern about the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> (SM) in long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> in patients treated in the German Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>Sarcoma</z:hpo> Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen (VACA = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and adriamycin; or VAIA = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, and adriamycin) and a total number of four courses, each lasting nine weeks, was recommended by the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of these were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 4) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 1), and three were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, 96 months for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 82-136 months for the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Out of five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, three died of rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-progression, and two are living with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> had received radiotherapy; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the CESS-studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after treatment for Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is probably in the range of 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Effective salvage therapy for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> is feasible </plain></SENT>
