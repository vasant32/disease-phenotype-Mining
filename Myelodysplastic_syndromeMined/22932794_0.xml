<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 2-day method using flow cytometry and FISH for interphase cells was developed to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method, Interphase Chromosome Flow-FISH (IC Flow-FISH), involves fixation of leukocytes from blood, membrane permeabilization, hybridization of cellular DNA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> probes with cells intact, and analysis by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hundreds to thousands of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cells were consistently detected from 10-20 mL of blood in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportions of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cells detected in IC Flow-FISH were compared with results from conventional cytogenetics; identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 populations was verified with FACS; and patient and donor cells were mixed to test for sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IC Flow-FISH allows for detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 without requiring bone marrow procurement or the necessity of metaphase spreads, and wider applications to other chromosomal abnormalities are in development </plain></SENT>
