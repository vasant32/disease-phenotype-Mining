<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past, patients were often assessed for risk using scoring systems developed for other diseases, notably the International Prognostic Scoring System commonly used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anderson Prognostic Scoring System, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, absolute lymphocyte count, peripheral blood immature cells, and bone marrow blasts, was developed specifically for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>; it was based on retrospective analysis of 213 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the original MDAPS system and a modified version derived from data of the initial cohort after extended follow-up (substituting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase for bone marrow blasts) effectively stratify both patient cohorts by survival and provide a useful risk assessment tool and additional guidance during treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
