<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease is increasing, no multivariate analysis of factors influencing survival has been undertaken, mainly because the disease is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook such an investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on 220 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> diagnosed over a 46-year period (1950-1995) from participating French centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the disease required, at least, an unequivocally positive Ham's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 65% (SE 4) at 10 years and 48% (6) at 15 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>8-year cumulative incidence rates of the main complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) were 15% (3), 28% (4), and 5% (2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, presenting features, initial treatment, complications, and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were similar to those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, seven factors were significantly associated with survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor survival was associated with the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a complication (relative risk 10.2 [95% CI 6-17], p &lt; 0.0001), evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (5.5 [2.8-11], p &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (19.1 [7.3-50], p &lt; 0.001), age over 55 years at diagnosis (4 [2.4-6.9], p &lt; 0.0001), need for additional treatment (2.1 [1.3-3.6], p &lt; 0.003), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at diagnosis (2.2 [1.3-3.8, p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Better survival was shown for patients in whom aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> antedated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (0.32 [0.14-0.72], p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors associated in multivariate analysis with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during the disease course were <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at diagnosis (5.1 [2.5-10.6], p = 0.0002), age over 54 years (2.6 [1.5-4.6, p = 0.0014), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at diagnosis (2.6 [1.3-5.2], p = 0.0099) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> were absence at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (4.03 [1.3-12.2], p = 0.03) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (2.45 [1.1-5.7], p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> crisis at presentation (10.5 [2.5-44.0], p = 0.004) and year of diagnosis after 1983 (8.45 [1.8-40.7], p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This large number of cases permitted a detailed analysis of prognostic factors for the first time, in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Estimates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> prognostic factors may serve as baseline data in the assessment of current and future treatments for this disease </plain></SENT>
