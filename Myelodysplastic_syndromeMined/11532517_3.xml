<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified the commonly deleted region between D1S508 and D1S244 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LOH of this region was found in five patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, LOH at 1p was associated with a poor clinical outcome, suggesting that the deletion of a gene in this region may be involved in the course of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the chromosomal map of this region, we found TNFRSF12 as a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, our search for mutations in this gene did not identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with the possible existence of an as-yet unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in this region that is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
