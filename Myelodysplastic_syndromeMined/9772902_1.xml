<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The q31-q33 region of chromosome 5 includes a number of genes encoding growth factors, growth factor receptors, and hormone/neurotransmitter receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human fibroblast growth factor 1 locus (FGF1) resides in this region of chromosome 5, which is frequently lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other disease loci, including the loci for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, have been mapped on this region, but their genes have not been isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the critical region lost in two patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> resides between FGF1 and IL12B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the construction of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning 330 kb around the FGF1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we report the isolation of additional YAC clones that extend 290 kb from the previous contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence-tagged sites developed from the outermost YAC ends were utilized in the contig cloning of two P1 clones P1Y2 and P1Y8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these YAC and P1 clones span 720 kb around the FGF1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization, a physical map has been constructed of these P1 and GRL (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor locus) probes on metaphase and interphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our work and the known orientation of GRL transcription, the determined order of these loci on chromosome 5q31.3-q32 is centromere-P1Y8-3'[FGF1]5'-P1Y2-5'[GRL]3'-telome re </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowing the transcriptional orientation of the FGF1 gene relative to the centromere will now facilitate the directional cloning of clinically important genes that may reside in this region </plain></SENT>
