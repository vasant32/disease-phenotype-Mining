<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune-mediated graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (GVL) effects constitute the major benefit of allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have introduced the use of relatively nonmyeloablative conditioning before allogeneic BMT aiming for establishing host-versus-graft tolerance for engraftment of donor immunohematopoietic cells for induction of GVL effects to displace residual malignant or genetically abnormal host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary data in 26 patients with standard indications for allogeneic BMT, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 10); <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 8), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> (n = 4) suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning including fludarabine, anti-T-lymphocyte globulin, and low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg) is extremely well tolerated, with no severe procedure-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized blood stem cell transplantation with standard dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> as the sole anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis resulted in stable partial (n = 9) or complete (n = 17) chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not decrease to below 0.1 x 10(9)/L whereas 2 patients never experienced ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ANC &gt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was accomplished within 10 to 32 (median, 15) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts did not decrease to below 20 x 10(9)/L in 4 patients requiring no platelet support at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; overall platelet counts &gt; 20 x 10(9)/L were achieved within 0 to 35 (median 12) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients experienced no GVHD at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; severe GVHD (grades 3 and 4) was the single major complication and the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 4 patients, occurring after early discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relapse was reversed by allogeneic cell therapy in 2/3 cases, currently with no residual host DNA (male) by cytogenetic analysis and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To date, with an observation period extending over 1 year (median 8 months), 22 of 26 patients (85%) treated by allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation are alive, and 21 (81%) are disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial probability of disease-free survival at 14 months is 77.5% (95% confidence interval, 53% to 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Successful eradication of malignant and genetically abnormal host hematopoietic cells by allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation represents a potential new approach for safer treatment of a large variety of clinical syndromes with an indication for allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transient mixed chimerism which may protect the host from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD may be successfully reversed postallogeneic BMT with graded increments of donor lymphocyte infusions, thus resulting in eradication of malignant or genetically abnormal progenitor cells of host origin </plain></SENT>
