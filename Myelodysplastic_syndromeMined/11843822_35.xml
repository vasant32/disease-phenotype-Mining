<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with thalidomide at 100 mg/d p.o., increased as tolerated to 400 mg/d for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, macrophage number, microvessel density (MVD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were determined in the serum, bone marrow (BM) plasma and BM biopsies before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretherapy biological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were compared with similar studies performed in 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients demonstrated haematological improvement in the erythroid series, six becoming transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responders had a higher pretherapy platelet count (P &lt; 0.048) and lower BM blasts (P &lt; 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to response was 10 weeks, and four remain in remission beyond a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretherapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BMs showed higher MVD (P &lt; 0.001) and TGF-beta (P &lt; 0.03) and higher serum TNF-alpha (P &lt; 0.008) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After therapy, only BM TGF-beta decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretherapy <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was directly related to serum VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) in responders and inversely related in non-responders (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting the possibility that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may be a primary pathology in the former and a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thalidomide has important clinical and biological effects in at least a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but the precise mechanism of its action remains unknown and requires further study including a larger number of patients </plain></SENT>
