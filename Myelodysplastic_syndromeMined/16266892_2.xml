<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acquired HbH has recently been associated with mutations in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> gene, ATRX, previously linked to inherited ATR-X syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha thalassemia</z:e>-retardation-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X linked</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A Swiss man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> complicated by various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and by strikingly microcytic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001931'>hypochromic anemia</z:hpo> was analyzed for the presence of acquired HbH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After HbH detection, we sought an underlying genetic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to screen for an ATRX mutation, and measured ATRX expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient had 50% HbH-containing cells on supravital staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow karyotype and the alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> cluster were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clonally-restricted ATRX point mutation was detected in the conserved splice donor motif in intron 4 (IVS 4 +2 T--&gt;C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasmid vector cloning of patient ATRX cDNA demonstrated both exon 4 skipping and partial intron retention with activation of a cryptic splice site, both outcomes resulting in frameshifts with premature stop codon generation in exon 5 and near-decimation of ATRX expression in myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> exon 6 alternative splicing was retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Intronic ATRX mutations with splicing consequences, uncommon in inherited ATR-X syndrome because of their devastating effect on expression of functional protein, should be routinely sought when undertaking molecular analysis of acquired HbH disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of an acquired ATRX mutation can help support clonality in karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ambiguous myeloid disorders with HbH </plain></SENT>
