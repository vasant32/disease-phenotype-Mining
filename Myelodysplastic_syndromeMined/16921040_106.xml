<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Within the last two decades, a new understanding of the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this understanding, new classification systems, such as the WHO diagnostic criteria, and the International Prognostic Scoring System and response criteria guidelines reported by the International Working Group (IWG) have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the combined results of three previously reported clinical trials (n = 309) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> using the WHO classification system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and IWG criteria for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from three sequential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> were recollected and reanalyzed as part of the New Drug Application process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trials were conducted with either intravenous or subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days every 28 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remissions were seen in 10% to 17% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>-treated patients; partial remissions were rare; 23% to 36% of patients had hematologic improvement (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of cycles to first response was three, and 90% of responses were seen by cycle 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using current WHO criteria, 103 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at baseline; 35% to 48% had HI or better responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival time for the 27 AML patients randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was 19.3 months compared with 12.9 months for the 25 patients assigned to observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> did not increase the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> above the rate caused by underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> provides important clinical benefits for patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
