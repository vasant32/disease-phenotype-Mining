<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, telomere shortening occurs in the vast majority of tissues during aging, and telomere shortening is accelerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases that increase the rate of cell turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, the functional role of telomere dysfunction and DNA damage in human aging and diseases remains under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified marker proteins (i.e., CRAMP, stathmin, EF-1alpha, and chitinase) that are secreted from telomere-dysfunctional bone-marrow cells of late generation telomerase knockout mice (G4mTerc(-/-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of these proteins increase in blood and in various tissues of aging G4mTerc(-/-) mice but not in aging mice with long telomere reserves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Orthologs of these proteins are up-regulated in late-passage presenescent human fibroblasts and in early passage human cells in response to gamma-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study shows that the expression level of these marker proteins increases in the blood plasma of aging humans and shows a further increase in geriatric patients with aging-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a significant increase in the expression of the biomarkers in the blood plasma of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases that are associated with increased rates of cell turnover and telomere shortening, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of blinded test samples validated the effectiveness of the biomarkers to discriminate between young and old, and between disease groups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept that telomere dysfunction and DNA damage are interconnected pathways that are activated during human aging and disease </plain></SENT>
