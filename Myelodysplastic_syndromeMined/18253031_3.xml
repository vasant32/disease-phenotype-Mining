<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of 41 previously karyotyped cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with apparent <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 20 revealed a variety of dicentric abnormalities involving chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These usually, but not always, involved a breakpoint in the long arm of chromosome 20 and loss of the common deleted region at 20q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not one case of true <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found evidence for dicentric chromosome formation in 21 of 24 unbalanced translocations containing chromosome 20 and that were studied in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent loss of one of the centromeres had occurred in eight of these 24 cases, and was more frequent than centromere inactivation as a means of resolving the inherent instability of a dicentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the three cases with dicentric chromosomes from which proximal 20q had been excised along with the 20 centromere, the excised segment was retained, and in two of these it was amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal 20q was clearly retained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three cases, and present in three or more copies in 17 of 41 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The retention and amplification of proximal 20q provides support for the hypothesis that there is an oncogene located in this region of 20q that is activated in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with del(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apparent <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> should be treated as evidence of unidentified chromosome 20 abnormalities, and familiarity with the typical G-banded <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of these derivatives can help with their identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reported incidence of dicentric chromosomes is clearly an under-estimate but is increasing in myeloid disorders as more cases are studied with methods allowing their detection </plain></SENT>
