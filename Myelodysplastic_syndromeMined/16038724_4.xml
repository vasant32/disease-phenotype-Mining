<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, we examined karyotypes of bone marrow specimens of an oligocentric cohort comprising 529 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to address the question how many metaphases need to be analyzed to detect even small cell clones with an appropriate expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant difference of the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes in the patient group with 19 or less analyzed metaphases compared to the group with 20 or more metaphases analyzed (56% versus 47%, p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the analysis of 25 or more metaphases can further improve the sensitivity of karyotype analysis and leads to the identification of additional clinically relevant abnormal clones or subclones in a substantial proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data suggest the examination of at least 20 metaphases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
