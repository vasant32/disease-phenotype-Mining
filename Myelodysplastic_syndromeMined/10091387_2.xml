<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite the fact that several prognostic systems for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been proposed, few studies have been designed to test their effectiveness in independent patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of 8 previously described prognostic systems in a series of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients observed at a single institution over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-three patients were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were studied retrospectively in order to assess the prognostic value of the FAB classification and 7 other prognostic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of data at diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated systems effectively stratified patients into groups with different life expectancies and identified a subset of patients with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the systems had different outcomes concerning median survival of patients classified as low-risk, ranging from less than 3 years for the Mufti scoring system to more than 8 years for the FAB classification modified according to Rosati et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patient distribution into different risk categories was quite different with the different prognostic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: When applied to our case series, some of the prognostic systems had a much lower prognostic value than in the patient population from which they derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests that testing of prognostic systems in independent case series is necessary before using the systems in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
