<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether TD of these two genes occurs simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 13 AML and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, including 6 adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 and 9 pediatric patients with TD of the FLT3 gene, using RT-PCR followed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these, TD of the MLL and FLT3 genes was found in 5 and 10 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, TD of both the MLL and FLT3 genes (coduplication) was detected in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, who died 6 and 14 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TD of these two genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is rare; thus, coduplication of these genes in the same patient is predicted to be very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of TD of both genes are different, development of TD of both genes may be related to an unknown similar etiology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> because the frequency of coduplication of these genes in a single patient is considered to be very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the coduplication of these genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients may lead to the clarification of its mechanism and clinical implications </plain></SENT>
