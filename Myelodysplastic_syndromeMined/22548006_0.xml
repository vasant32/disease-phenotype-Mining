<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study describes changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels in patients during chemotherapy before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment and in those who received no treatment, measuring time from chemotherapy initiation to Hb less than 10 g/dL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study used a database of outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice electronic medical records from January 1, 2006, to August 6, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unit of analysis was episode of chemotherapy care, beginning at initiation and including consecutive administrations within the next 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received two or more administrations of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis with at least 60 days of follow-up, and had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,864 episodes (4,021 patients) met selection criteria, 73% with baseline Hb of 11 g/dL or greater and 60% receiving no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Episodes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment increased from 44.6% (2006) to 77.8% (2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) use decreased from 45.4% (2006) to 11.5% (2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving transfusions increased from 3.4% to 8.7% (2006 to 2009; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total proportion of episodes with Hb less than 10 g/dL at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment increased from 16.2% to 93.1% during the same period (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean Hb values before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment decreased over time from 10.8 to 8.9 g/dL (2006 to 2009; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, time from chemotherapy initiation to first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment increased from 24.7 to 36.9 days (2006 to 2009; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest increased restrictions were associated with decreased use of ESAs and increased use of transfusions as well as delays in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment and lower Hb levels before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional investigation of the overall impact of delayed treatments on long-term patient outcomes is warranted </plain></SENT>
