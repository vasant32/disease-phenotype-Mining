<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that, among other factors, comorbidity may be an important prognostic variable in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who are eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the overall survival (OS) and underlying risk factors in 45 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 38), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 1), or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 6), who underwent allogeneic SCT at our Institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 37 months, OS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 23%, post-transplant relapse occurred in 11 patients, and 10 patients died from treatment-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall outcome and survival was independent of cytogenetic abnormalities and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, we identified comorbidity as defined by the haematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as a significant adverse prognostic variable in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data and similar published data we recommend selecting patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> for SCT according to the presence of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
