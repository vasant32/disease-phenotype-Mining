<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven women &lt;60 years of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and extensive axillary lymph node involvement received three courses of FE120C (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 500 mg/m2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi> 120 mg/m2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 500 mg/m2) followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one patients were randomized to receive either a fourth FE120C course alone or a fourth FE120C course followed by high-dose chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 6 g/m2, thiotepa 480 mg/m2, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> 1600 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a univariate analysis on possible prognostic factors and analyzed the sites of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 47 (48%) patients were alive, of whom 36 (38%) were without disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients relapsed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, without a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In intention-to-treat analysis, the 5-year DFS rates were 47.5% in the conventional treatment arm and 49% in the high-dose arm, and the 5-year OS rates were 62.5% and 61%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the clinical T-stage before chemotherapy and the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-positive axillary lymph nodes after induction chemotherapy (P = 0.027) were significant prognostic factors for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same factors (both P = 0.06) plus the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (P = 0.08) were borderline significant factors for DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After a median follow-up of 6.9 years there was no difference in OS or DFS rates between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-positive axillary lymph nodes after induction chemotherapy and the clinical T-stage before chemotherapy were significant factors for OS </plain></SENT>
