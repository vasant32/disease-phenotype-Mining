<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between SF3B1 mutation, erythroid activity and hepcidin levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid activity was evaluated through the proportion of marrow erythroblasts, soluble transferrin receptor and serum growth differentiation factor 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant relationships were found between SF3B1 mutation and marrow erythroblasts (P=0.001), soluble transferrin receptor (P=0.003) and serum growth differentiation factor 15 (P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum hepcidin varied considerably, and multivariable analysis showed that the hepcidin to ferritin ratio, a measure of adequacy of hepcidin levels relative to body iron stores, was inversely related to the SF3B1 mutation (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that patients with SF3B1 mutation have inappropriately low hepcidin levels, which may explain their propensity to parenchymal iron loading </plain></SENT>
