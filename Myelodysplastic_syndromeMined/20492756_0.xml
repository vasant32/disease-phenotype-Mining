<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both mono- and bi-allelic CEBPA mutations were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we also identified CEBPA mutations in healthy individuals and in patients with peripheral artery disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 16 various deletions with the presence of two direct repeats in CEBPA by analysis of 431 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three most frequent repeats included in these deletions in CEBPA gene are CGCGAG (493- 498_865-870), GG (486-487_885-886), and GCCAAGCAGC (508-517_907-916), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> according to GenBank Accession No </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NM_004364.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case we identified that a father with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and his healthy son had two identical deletions (493_864del and 508_906del, both according to GenBank Accession No </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NM_004364.2) in CEBPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of deletions between two repetitive sequences may be caused by recombination events in the repair process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A double-stranded cut in DNA may initiate these recombination events in adjacent DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four types of polymorphisms in the CEBPA gene were also detected in the screened individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism in CEBPA gene 690 G&gt;T according to GenBank Accession No </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NM_004364.2 is the most frequent type in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis did not find significant differences in the frequency of polymorphisms in CEBPA in patients and in healthy individuals with the exception of P4 polymorphism (580_585dup according to GenBank Accesion No </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NM_004364.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>P4 polymorphism was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
