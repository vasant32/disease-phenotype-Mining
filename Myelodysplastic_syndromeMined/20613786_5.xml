<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> and suppressed functions of peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells have been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but only limited information is available on the phenotypic and functional integrity of NK cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 41 patients with distinct clinical subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we here show that NK cells in the bone marrow show decreased surface expression of the activating receptors DNAM-1 and NKG2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, decreased receptor expression correlated with elevated bone marrow blast counts and was associated with impaired NK-cell responsiveness to stimulation with the K562 cell line, or co-activation by NKG2D or DNAM-1 in combination with the 2B4 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, antibody-masking experiments revealed a central role for DNAM-1 in NK cell-mediated killing of freshly isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, given the emerging evidence for NK cell-mediated immune surveillance of neoplastic cells, we speculate that reduced expression of DNAM-1 on bone marrow NK cells may facilitate disease progression in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
