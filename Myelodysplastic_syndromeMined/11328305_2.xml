<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that V <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi>-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity among recipients of allogeneic BMT is influenced by the expression of major and minor HLA antigens in the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised unmanipulated and CD34(+)-selected allogeneic bone marrow grafts, autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants and recipients of volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, the relative frequencies of 18 V beta TCR families were determined and ranked for each time point studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons and correlations were made between paired blood samples obtained within a single patient over time, and between donors and their recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of the V beta TCR repertoire from allogeneic recipients and their HLA-matched donors was very similar, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This similarity was not as marked in VUD pairs (CC = 0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 3 months after transplant, the pattern of the V beta TCR repertoire in recipients of HLA-matched sibling transplants was more similar to the pattern seen in pretransplant recipients than to the donor pattern (CC = 0.40 vs. 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that both major and minor HLA antigens influence V beta TCR repertoire diversity and reconstitution after BMT </plain></SENT>
