<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to French-American-British (FAB) classification, 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 20 RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha levels were inversely correlated with lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (r = -0.31, p = 0.005), irrespective of the requirements for transfusion in anemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in TNF-alpha levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (26.2 +/- 5.9 pg/ml) and the FAB subgroups (16.1 +/- 1.6 pg/ml) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an overall inverse relationship between the level of erythropoietin and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, but a wide range of Epo response between patients with similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-1 alpha and GM-CSF were undetected in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 57% of the samples there were detectable levels of G-CSF, without a correlation of the serum levels with blood cell counts, nor with any of the FAB subcategories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 29% and 25% of the patient sera exhibited elevated IL-3 and IL-6 levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of the serum levels with any of the blood counts, other cytokines, nor FAB subcategories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, simple negative feedback mechanism between a specific cytokine and the production of blood cells seems not to be the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, except for red cell production and erythropoietin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data may suggest the involvement of TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
