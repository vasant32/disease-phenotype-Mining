<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing anti-GM-CSF IgG has been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>), and secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> has been linked to myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 69 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, including 19 patients who received GM-CSF with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antigen and incomplete Freund's adjuvant in a vaccine trial for the presence or induction of anti-GM-CSF antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-GM-CSF IgG were present in 36 (52%) patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> compared to only 1 of 33 (3%) healthy subjects (P=0.008) and in none of 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody titers were unaffected by vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-GM-CSF IgA and IgM were found in 33 and 20% of patients, respectively; IgA from two patients neutralized GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, while anti-GM-CSF IgG titers were higher in patients with active disease (n=52) versus those in complete remission (n=14, P=0.0009), GM-CSF expression was not increased in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are first to show that anti-GM-CSF antibodies of multiple isotypes are present in patients with active myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> without <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> and may be useful markers of disease activity </plain></SENT>
