<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rasburicase proved to be effective in rapidly reducing UA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Costs of rasburicase average up to 4500 euros </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess if lower doses of rasburicase are effective, we treated patients with lower doses than recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients received rasburicase for prophylaxis (n = 8) or treatment (n = 42) of TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 67 yr (16-88), 21 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (n = 46) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 14; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 26; myeloproliferative/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 6) and four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> levels were increased in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline median UA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were 856.5 micromol/L (339-1659.5 micromol/L) and 192.7 micromol/L (65.4-761.1 micromol/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients received between one and eight doses of rasburicase, the median total dose was 0.049 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UA levels were lowered by 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After rasburicase treatment, median serum UA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were 160.6 micromol/L (5.9-779.2 micromol/L) and 111.4 micromol/L (46.9-610 micromol/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment costs were reduced by 96.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of rasburicase are effective and cost-saving for prophylaxis and treatment of TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Application of an initial dose of 3-4.5 mg of rasburicase and subsequently dosage as needed, depending on UA levels, is feasible </plain></SENT>
