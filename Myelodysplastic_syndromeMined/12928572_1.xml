<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes 110 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 10 of ALL, 16 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M3), 2 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>(M2), 2 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 1 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conventional cytogenetic study was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases using G Banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 141 patients studied, 17 patients showed secondary chromosomal alterations along with primary chromosomal alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> with secondary chromosomal alteration t(4:9:22), molecular cytogenetic technique (FISH) has been carried out which has confirmed the primary observations revealed by the conventional cytogenetic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other secondary alterations were numerous and would have been missed if only FISH or PCR technique would have been used for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed from our study that advanced molecular techniques like FISH and PCR cannot replace the conventional cytogenetic study but are useful as supportive and confirmative diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
