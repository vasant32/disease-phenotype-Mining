<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies were undertaken to determine whether or not the myc gene was rearranged or mutated in exon I within a 3'Pvu II region, a transcriptional attenuation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies to explore the possibility of a point mutation in the N-ras gene were also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were detected in either gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies should be undertaken evaluating the possibility of a post-transcriptional mechanism, such as alteration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> stability, which could be responsible for the constitutive expression of c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
