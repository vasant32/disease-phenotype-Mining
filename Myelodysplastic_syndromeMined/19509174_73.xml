<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These old drugs, developed as cytotoxic agents and nearly abandoned decades ago were resurrected by the renewed interest in DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They have now provided proof of principle for epigenetic therapy, the final chapter in the long saga to provide legitimacy to the field of epigenetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But challenges remain; we don't understand precisely how or why the drugs work or stop working after an initial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extending these promising findings to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> faces substantial hurdles from drug uptake to clinical trial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We do not know yet how to select patients for this therapy and how to move it from life extension to cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic potential of DNA methylation inhibitors may be limited by other epigenetic mechanisms that are also worth exploring as therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But the idea of stably changing gene expression in vivo has transformative potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy and beyond </plain></SENT>
