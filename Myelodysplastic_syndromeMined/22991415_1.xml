<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Retrospective, surrogate marker-based studies have found inconsistent associations between systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (SIO) and adverse outcome in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the impact of SIO in this context remains under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether the objective pretransplant quantification of liver-iron content (LIC) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could circumvent these limitations and conclusively define the prognostic relevance of SIO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The correlation between pretransplant LIC and surrogate parameters as well as the impact of SIO on posttransplant outcome was assessed within an observational study of patients (n = 88) with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) undergoing allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ferritin levels of 1,000 ng/mL or more provided only poor specificity (31.8%) for predicting elevated LIC (≥125 μmol/g) and even higher thresholds (≥2,500 ng/mL) lacked an association with nonrelapse mortality (NRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LIC 125 μmol/g or more was a significant risk factor for NRM in uni- and multivariate analysis (HR = 2.98; P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox-regression further showed that LIC 125 μmol/g or more was associated with a decreased overall survival (HR = 2.24, P = 0.038), whereas ferritin or transfusion burden were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SIO reflected by LIC is an independent negative prognostic factor for posttransplant outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> undergoing allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, MRI-based LIC, and not interference-prone serum markers such as ferritin, should be preferred for pretransplant risk stratification and patient selection in future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
