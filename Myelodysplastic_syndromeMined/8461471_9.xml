<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the lineage involvement of peripheral blood cells from patients with a 5q--anomaly, purified neutrophils, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity using six different highly polymorphic mininucleotide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> (CA) repeat sequences from the 5q31 to 5q33 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and proved to be informative for at least one marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed a complete or partial disappearance of an allele in myeloid cells, whereas cells of lymphoid lineages exhibited full heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other patients displayed no allelic loss, indicating that the informative markers were located outside the deleted chromosomal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, three female patients who were also polymorphic for the BstXI site in the PGK-1 gene were analyzed for the methylation status of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonality of hematopoiesis, as determined by non-random X-chromosome inactivation, followed the same cell pattern as the 5q-specific allelic losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific and clonal markers, we have demonstrated that the 5q- anomaly is restricted to cells of myeloid origin, leaving lymphoid cells unaffected </plain></SENT>
