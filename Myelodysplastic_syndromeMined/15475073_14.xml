<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated P2X7 expression in 11 human hematopoietic cell lines, representing different lineages, as well as bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) samples from 87 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry results showed that both P2X7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were detected in eight cell lines with a non-lineage-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples from 69 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 9 MDS patients were P2X7 positive at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both positive rates and relative expression levels were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after one course of standard induction therapies, the remission rate in high P2X7 expression group was lower than that in either P2X7 negative group or low P2X7 expression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic free calcium increase was detected in five of eight P2X7+ cell lines as well as P2X7+ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor and patient samples tested, but not in three Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive cell lines (J6-1, Namalwa, and LCL-H) in Locke's solution upon stimulation by extracellular ATP or the more potent and specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, 2',3'-O-(4-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="22733">benzoyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="22733">benzoyl</z:chebi>-ATP (BzATP) </plain></SENT>
