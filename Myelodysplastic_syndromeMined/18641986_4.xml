<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, available data on feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of this therapy are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and outcome of different antifungal combination therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> receiving antifungal combination therapy for IFI were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity and response were documented at the end of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was evaluated at the end of therapy and after 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients were treated with different antifungal combinations in the period between 2001 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (63%) received a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> and caspofungin as antifungal combination treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of combination therapy, favourable response was 65%, whereas unfavourable outcome occurred in 35% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality at the end of treatment was 11% and 34% 3 months after initiation of combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antifungal combination therapy is feasible and efficient in haematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients with IFI </plain></SENT>
