<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our aim was to collate national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry incidence data to describe the epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The New Zealand <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry has now reported five complete years of incidence data, the last three of which were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the years 2005-2007, age-sex specific and age-standardised <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence rates from New Zealand were compared with those from Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated by the direct standardisation method and standardised rate ratios were compared at the 5, 1 and 0.1% levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> represented 1.3% of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registrations in New Zealand and 1.0% in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both New Zealand and Australia, 86-87% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were diagnosed in individuals â‰¥60 years of age, the incidence increased significantly with age, and males had a significantly higher age-standardised incidence rate (P &lt; 0.001) than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for New Zealand males was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than Australian males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both New Zealand males and females, the age-standardised incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than most other haematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In New Zealand and Australia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a common haematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marked difference between male and female incidence rates, especially with advancing age, may provide insights into the causes of this disease </plain></SENT>
