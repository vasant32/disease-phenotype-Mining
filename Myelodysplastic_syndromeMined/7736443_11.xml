<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the structure of the del(20q) in 30 patients and two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the patients presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> and nine with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two categories of deletions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had a large deletion with loss of both G(+) bands from the long arm of chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had small deletions with loss of one G(+) band from the long arm of chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A chromosome paint was generated from a del 20q marker carrying a small deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This probe was hybridized to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases (reverse chromosome painting) and also to metaphases from patients with a del 20q (comparative reverse chromosome painting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six small deletions analyzed were characterized by loss of the proximal G(+) band (q12) and retention of the distal G(+) band (q13.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data define a minimal deleted region extending from 20q11.2-20q13.1 </plain></SENT>
