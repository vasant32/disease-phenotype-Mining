<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed records of 767 patients treated at Moffitt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center between January 2001 and December 2009 to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin (SA) at the time of presentation and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (median age of 69 years) were stratified into three groups based on SA concentration (≤3.5, 3.6-4.0, and &gt;4.0 g/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the patients had low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-based risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median OS by SA concentration of ≤3.5, 3.6-4.0, and &gt;4.0 g/dL was 11, 23, and 34 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.005), whereas rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> progression was highest in patients with low SA (≤3.5 g/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SA level offered prognostic discrimination for outcomes within the lower and higher IPSS risk groups, as well as with the MD Anderson risk model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, SA was a significant independent co-variate for OS after adjustment for IPSS, age, serum ferritin, and transfusion dependence (hazard ratio = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-0.9; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo> is an independent prognostic biomarker that may serve as a surrogate representative of disease biology or comorbidities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
