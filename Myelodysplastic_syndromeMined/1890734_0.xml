<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean erythrocyte ferritin levels of patients with RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, PA, HS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver disease</z:e> were increased compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On isoelectric focusing analyses (IEF), erythrocyte ferritin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were detected between pI 5.1 and 5.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cases of RA, pI ranges of erythrocyte ferritin may be divided into three groups, acidic, neutral, basic shift on IEF respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these groups, the more acidic the ferritin shift, the higher the proportion of morphological abnormalities of the erythroid precursors in the bone marrow was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M2, M3, M4), little difference was found among these three subtypes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases showed similar pattern with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects on IEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ferritin from IDA showed low levels and slight basic shift compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects on IEF, and these features were also found in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After iron supplementation, marked increase of acidic ferritin was detected on IEF indicating an intermediate store for iron destined for haem synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was clear that the stainable iron in liver parenchymal cells were found at erythrocyte ferritin concentration 20 ag/cell or over in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of erythrocyte ferritin concentration is a helpful method for evaluating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in hepatocyte non-invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From these results it is considered that quantitative and qualitative analyses of erythrocyte ferritin are very useful for evaluating erythropoiesis as well as iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
