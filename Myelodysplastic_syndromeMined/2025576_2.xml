<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytic hypogranulation, a feature we have noticed for some time to be fairly common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), has received little attention in the literature as a dysplastic feature of megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine how frequently this feature was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the specificity of its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On review of archival materials, hypogranular megakaryocytes were observed in 80.3% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 30.6% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 1.4% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the other well-recognized dysmegakaryocytopoietic features (hypolobulation, multiple separate nuclei, micromegakaryocyte), though frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, were also observed in 20% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose including megakaryocytic hypogranulation as a cytological feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
