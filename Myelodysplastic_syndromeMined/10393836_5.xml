<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the function of the carboxy-terminal fusion partner, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> factor 1 (MLF1), is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To aid in understanding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MLF1 function, we isolated the murine cDNA, determined the chromosomal localization of Mlf1, and defined its tissue expression by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mlf1 was highly similar to its human homologue (86% and 84% identical nucleotide and amino acid sequence, respectively) and mapped to the central region of chromosome 3, within a segment lacking known mouse mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mlf1 tissue distribution was restricted during both development and postnatal life, with high levels present only in skeletal, cardiac, and selected smooth muscle, gonadal tissues, and rare epithelial tissues including the nasal mucosa and the ependyma/choroid plexus in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mlf1 transcripts were undetectable in the lympho-hematopoietic organs of both the embryonic and adult mouse, suggesting that NPM-MLF1 contributes to the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in part by enforcing the ectopic overexpression of MLF1 within hematopoietic tissues </plain></SENT>
