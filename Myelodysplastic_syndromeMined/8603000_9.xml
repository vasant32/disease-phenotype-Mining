<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Statistical correlations among the cytological, haematological, histological and immunohistochemical parameters and their relationship with clinical outcome were searched for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At univariate analysis, FAB classification (P &lt; 0.001), pattern of blastic infiltration at BMB (P &lt; 0.005), presence of CD34+ aggregates (P &lt; 0.0005), percentage of blasts in BM aspirate (P &lt; 0.0001) and percentage of CD34 positivity (P &lt; 0.0001) proved to be linked to leukaemic transformation and, except for FAB classification, retained a high degree of prognostic significance in terms of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukaemic transformation occurred in 16/18 patients simultaneously presenting 'large' blastic infiltrates at BMB and CD34+ aggregates (P &lt; 0.00001); 9/17 evaluable patients died within 12 months of diagnosis (P &lt; 0.001)&gt; Discriminant functions for leukaemic transformation and survival did not offer any advantage over univariate analysis in the prognostic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the size of blastic aggregates and CD34 positivity allowed patients with a worse prognosis to be identified irrespective of their FAB subtype, but the prognostic impact is considerably greater when both parameters are simultaneously taken into account, as testified by the restricted and homogeneous subgroup of patients with both 'large' and CD34-positive aggregates </plain></SENT>
