<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System in Dallas, TX, provides a unique opportunity for clinical pharmacists to work as providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though clinical pharmacists are actively involved in patient care, many of their efforts remain undocumented, resulting in an underestimation of the importance of their services and missed opportunities for improvements and new directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document and evaluate the services of a hematology/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> clinical pharmacy in the outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pendragon Forms 3.2 software was used to design the documentation template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The template was designed to collect diagnoses, supportive care issues, drug-specific interventions, and prescriptions written </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This template was uploaded to the personal digital assistant (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) for documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient-specific information was documented in a password-protected <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data collected from November 1, 2002, to October 31, 2003, were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical pharmacists were involved in 423 patient visits for chemotherapy follow-up or disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> diagnoses included colorectal (n = 99), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (59), non-small cell lung (56), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (44), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (22), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the 423 patient visits, 342 supportive care issues were addressed including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (34%), pain management (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (15%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major drug-specific interventions included drug addition (41%), discontinuation (23%), and adjustment (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four hundred forty-five prescriptions were filled, of which 181 were new and 150 were refilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, as of July 25, 2006, to document considerable contribution of an outpatient clinical pharmacist in direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the disease management and supportive care issues addressed here may differ based on institution and patient population, the results of our study show that clinical pharmacists have ever-growing roles in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
