<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are biologically diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The French-American-British (FAB) classification of adult forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not always applicable because many pediatric patients do not fit into any of the categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To circumvent the FAB schema and other flawed formats, the authors developed a practical classification system for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed 40 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed in Toronto between 1988 and 1998 to test the utility of the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children were classified according to three main features: category, cytology, and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using this system the authors were able to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 40 patients; about half could not be classified by FAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients could also be longitudinally classified by serial analysis to show progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was excluded because of its known myeloproliferative pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which almost never occurs in children, was also omitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also excluded were other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and any cytopenias without malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> system appears to have prognostic potential; children with advanced class and cytogenetic abnormalities had a poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors urge international adoption of this system for uniformity in clinical practice and reporting purposes </plain></SENT>
