<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent of these diseases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelo-monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, a disease of elderly people that has long been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in biological studies as well as in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent identification of a number of genetic mutations in the leukemic clone, including frequent mutations in TET2, ASXL1 and RUNX1, less frequent mutations in NRAS, KRAS and C-CBL, and rare mutations in JAK2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, and EZHR2 may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient care depends on the disease risk, especially the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, the age and the performance status </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In high risk patients, the only curative therapeutic is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is rarely feasible due to the age of the patients and the absence of donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demethylating agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> are currently the most efficient drugs </plain></SENT>
