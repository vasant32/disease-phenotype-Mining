<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Immune dysfunction</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> has been attributed to abnormal signal transduction, possibly through altered expression of intracellular components of the TCR/CD3 complex (e.g. CD3-zeta), receptors on NK cells and their associated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs; p56lck, p59fyn and ZAP-70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a flow cytometric method to detect dual-expression of surface proteins and intracellular components of the TCR/CD3 complex, we have studied 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD3-zeta expression was abnormal in 64% of patients, and was more prominent in those with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients with reduced CD3-zeta were analysed both pre- and post-treatment, and recovery of CD3-zeta expression was associated with successful remission induction (expression of PTKs was variable and reduced levels were seen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease stages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that loss of signalling proteins is not a result of direct contact of leukaemic cells with lymphocytes per se or the extent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> burden, but to a specific property of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, which is more frequently acquired with greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
