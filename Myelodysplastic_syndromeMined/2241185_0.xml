<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dosage for the single and 5-day oral administration ranged 50 to 1,200 and 100 to 900 mg/body/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main adverse effects were myelo-suppression and gastrointestinal toxicities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the single administration, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) could not be determined, however, in the 5-day schedule MTD was considered to be 700 to 900 mg/body/day, and the dose limiting factor to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
