<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we determined whether microsatellite instability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and PARP inhibitor sensitivity through disruption of DNA repair function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Design and Methods <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines (n=12) and primary cell samples (n=18) and bone marrow mononuclear cells from high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=63) were profiled for microsatellite instability using fluorescent fragment PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARP inhibitor sensitivity was performed using cell survival, annexin V staining and cell cycle analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homologous recombination was studied using immunocytochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP karyotyping was used to study <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing, western blotting and gene expression analysis was used to study the functional consequences of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines (4/12, 33%) and primary samples (2/18, 11%) exhibited microsatellite instability with mono-allelic mutations in CtIP and MRE11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with reduced expression of mismatch repair pathway components, MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both microsatellite instability positive primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> samples and cell lines demonstrated a down-regulation of homologous recombination DNA repair conferring marked sensitivity to PARP inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, bone marrow mononuclear cells from 11/56 (20%) patients with de novo high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> exhibited microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients with microsatellite instability had cytogenetic abnormalities with 4/11 (36%) patients possessing a mono-allelic microsatellite mutation in CtIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 50% reduction in CtIP expression by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing also down-regulated homologous recombination DNA repair responses conferring PARP inhibitor sensitivity, whilst CtIP differentially regulated the expression of homologous recombination modulating RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Microsatellite instability dependent mutations in DNA repair genes, CtIP and MRE11 are detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> conferring hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors </plain></SENT>
