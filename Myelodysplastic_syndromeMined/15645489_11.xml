<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, no cryptic chromosome aberrations were observed with M-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 56 patients with a previously solved abnormal karyotype, only 17 new aberrations were identified, whereas 153 new aberrations were detected by M-FISH in 42 patients with a previously unsolved karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 112 of the new aberrations were unbalanced translocations, and only nine were balanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clustering of breakpoints was observed in the centromeric or pericentromeric region of chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 13, 17, 21, and 22 in 48 of 98 patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and an abnormal karyotype, and was related to previous therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven of eight patients with chromosome derivatives containing material from three or more chromosomes or having sandwichlike chromosomes, those made up of several small interchanging layers of material from two chromosomes showed mutations of TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M-FISH had little impact on the prognostic classification of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as only three patients changed prognostic groups as a result of M-FISH </plain></SENT>
