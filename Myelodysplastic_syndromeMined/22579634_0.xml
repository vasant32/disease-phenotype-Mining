<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the only approach with curative potential remains allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no direct comparison of both strategies has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of 2 well-balanced cohorts of patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> defined by age (60-70 years), performance status (Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group score ≤2), and donor availability (yes/no) were compared, including 103 patients undergoing HCT and 75 patients without this option who received AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated 2-year overall survival after the start of treatment was 39% (95% confidence interval, 30%-50%) for the patients undergoing HCT and 23% (95% confidence interval, 14%-40%) for the patients receiving AZA therapy </plain></SENT>
