<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were treated with daily low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (10 mg/m2/12h, infused over 2h) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (50 mg/m2/day, infused over 2h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of these patients were finally evaluated among whom 6 with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (64.3%) had complete remission, and 2 with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (14.3%) achieved partial remission after this chemotherapy for 9 to 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of 11 responders were resistant to the prior chemotherapies with single and low dose cytotoxic agents including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, or aclarubicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients who could be assessed developed severe marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> after chemotherapy, the nonhematologic side effects were mild enough to be tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This combination chemotherapy must be effective and useful in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> not only without prior chemotherapy but in cases which have been resistant to single and low dose oncostatic agent </plain></SENT>
