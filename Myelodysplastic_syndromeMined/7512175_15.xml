<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In retrospective studies, approximately 3-36% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were reported to harbor a mutated ras proto-oncogene, with some series suggesting the presence of ras-mutations are associated with progressive disease and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are currently used for therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but may stimulate the proliferation of leukemic cells, we assessed the frequency and significance of ras mutations in 27 MDS patients, 15 of whom underwent G-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed for the presence of mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the N- and K-ras proto-oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three patients (11%, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>)) harbored activated ras oncogenes with the mutations localized in N-ras codons 12 and 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for periods of up to 4 years or until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> supervened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibiting ras mutations were no more likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compared to ras-negative patients (1/3 vs. 10/24) or to have decreased survival (p = 0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that, in this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, ras mutations do not appear to correlate with a poor prognosis, and do not adversely interact with exogenously administered G-CSF </plain></SENT>
