<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were considered as partial responders and 5 as refractory to initial chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of chemotherapy alone (CBV in 11 patients before 1993, BEAM in 13 patients since 1993) followed by adjuvant radiotherapy: 40 Gy) on the initial sites of bulky disease, or 12 Gy total body irradiation plus 120 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in 11 patients with disseminated extra-nodal disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four out of the 5 patients with refractory disease at the time of ASCT experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 6 years of CR post-ASCT, the last refractory patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> diagnosed 2 years after intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 51 months (range: 11-111), the cumulative probability of 8-year overall survival is 75.6% for the entire group of patients, 94.1% for the chemosensitive ones, and 0% for the primary refractory (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of 8-year event-free survival is 79.9% for the entire group of patients, 94.1% for the chemosensitive ones, and 0% for the primary refractory (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early intensive therapy with ASCT is feasible in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and induces a high cure rate in chemosensitive patients </plain></SENT>
