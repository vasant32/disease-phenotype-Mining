<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on a 6 1/2-year study of 284 consecutive adult patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), we have found that refined chromosome analysis can be used as an independent prognostic indicator in the great majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the FAB subtype was also found to have prognostic value and this was enhanced when the chromosomal findings were taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the age of the patient correlated more closely with the chromosomal changes in predicting prognosis in most patients than did the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously we reported that refined chromosome analysis of bone marrow specimens from 161 adult patients with primary or non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy related MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> identified three prognostic chromosomal categories in each disease, representing 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (Yunis et al, 1984, 1986) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By extending our study to 284 patients, as well as a longer follow-up, it was possible to determine the prognostic implications of two additional chromosomal categories in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and five in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 73% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are now represented in well-defined chromosomal subgroups with prognostic significance, refined chromosome analysis emerges as a tool that could have considerable impact in protocols </plain></SENT>
