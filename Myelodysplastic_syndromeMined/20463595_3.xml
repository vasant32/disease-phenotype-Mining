<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adoptive immunotherapy is an important therapy option to reduce relapse rates after stem-cell transplantation in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myeloid leukemic cells can regularly be induced to differentiate into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived dendritic cells (DC(leu)), regaining the stimulatory capacity of professional dendritic cells (DCs) while presenting the known/unknown leukemic antigen repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, induced antileukemic T-cell responses are variable or even mediate opposite effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further elicit DC/DC(leu)-induced T-cell-response patterns, we generated DC from 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases and carried out flowcytometry and (functional) nonradioactive fluorolysis assays before/after mixed lymphocyte cultures of matched (allogeneic) donor T cells (n=6), T cells prepared at relapse after stem-cell transplantation (n=4) or (autologous) patients' T cells (n=7) with blast containing mononuclear cells ("MNC") or DC(leu) ("DC") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with "MNC", "DC" were better mediators of antileukemic-activity, although not in every case effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could define DC subtypes and cut-off proportions of DC subtypes/qualities (mature DC/DC(leu)) after "DC" priming, which were predictive for an antileukemic activity of primed T cells and the clinical course of the disease after immunotherapy (allogeneic stem-cell transplantation/donor lymphocytes infusion/therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data show that the composition and quality of DC after a mixed lymphocyte culture-priming phase is predictive for a successful ex vivo antileukemic response, especially with respect to proportions of mature and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data contribute not only to predict DC-mediated functions or the clinical course of the diseases but also to develop and refine DC-vaccination strategies that may pave the way to develop and modify adoptive immunotherapy, especially for patients at relapse after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
