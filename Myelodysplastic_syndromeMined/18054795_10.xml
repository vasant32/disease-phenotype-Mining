<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand the burden of disease-associated symptoms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we designed a 120-question Internet-based survey of QOL appropriate for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, incorporating validated QOL measurement instruments and questions about specific therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 359 survey respondents were typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in terms of demographics, blood counts, and disease subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients reported high levels of excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and poor scores on QOL assessments such as the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (FACT-An) and the Brief <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> Inventory (BFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' debilitating <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> correlated poorly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> was associated with significant impairment of both health-related QOL and ability to work or participate in desired activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the limitations of self-reported data, these results provide a benchmark for future interventions to improve QOL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
