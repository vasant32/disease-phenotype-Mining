<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison with a control group megakaryocytes (CD61-Y2/51) revealed not only a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, but remarkably irregular shapes of cells and nuclei, together with a disturbance of the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No predominance of micromegakaryocytes as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> was observable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrasting idiopathic (immune)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, HIV-infected patients with a pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the platelet count did not show a significant elevation of the number of promegakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This feature is in keeping with findings of a severe impairment of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a pronounced increase in the macrophage population (PG-M1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This alteration may be related to inflammatory lesions accompanying this disorder as well as to an enforced and premature destruction of hematopoietic cell elements in the myeloid stroma </plain></SENT>
