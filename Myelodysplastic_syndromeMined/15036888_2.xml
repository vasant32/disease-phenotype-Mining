<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 61-year-old woman who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and a t(5;7)(q11.2;p15) in her bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts showed that the translocation was constitutional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of chromosome bands 5q11.2 and 7p15 has been described recurrently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was not earlier than usual, it is nonetheless possible that genes interrupted by this translocation may been a predisposing factor for her condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, a further rearrangement of the constitutional der(7)t(5;7) occurred, involving chromosome arm 1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome paints showed that the result of the second rearrangement, a t(1;7)(q32.1;q32), was observed, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the segment 1q32.1 approximately qter and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of the segment 7q32.1 approximately qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The acquired imbalances, particularly loss of 7q, are commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and a poor prognosis; however, this patient remained in remission after treatment for more than two years before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> relapse, perhaps because the affected regions fall outside of the critical regions of imbalance </plain></SENT>
