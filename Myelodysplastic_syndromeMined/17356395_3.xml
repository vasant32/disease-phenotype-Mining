<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome anomalies may be found in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman syndrome</z:e>, who are at risk to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, an isochromosome i(7)(q10) is frequent, and is usually monitored by chromosome analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested an approach by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) on a chromosome 7 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five DNA samples of 2 Shwachman syndrome patients with clonal i(7)(q10) in the BM were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both were heterozygous for the diallelic indel polymorphism MID1064, which maps in 7q35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of i(7)(q10)-positive cells was extrapolated from the ratio of the 2 alleles measured by means of an allele-specific RQ-PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with cytogenetic analyses on the same material used for RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, the RQ-PCR results matched well with those of chromosome analyses, whereas in the other one RQ-PCR showed that around 40% of the BM cells were abnormal, while they resulted to be nearly 80% with conventional monitoring assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the results obtained by RQ-PCR refer to the DNA of around 128,000 BM cells, our method proved to be feasible and more efficient in the quantitative evaluation of the i(7)(q10)-positive clone than conventional ones </plain></SENT>
