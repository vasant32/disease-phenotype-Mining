<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematologic examination showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (12,400/microliter) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1,000/microliter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On bone marrow examination, megakaryocyte count was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the number of myeloblasts was increased (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serological examination was positive for anti-nuclear antibody and anti-DNA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as having idiopathic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and received thrombocyte transfusion and gamma-globulin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematologic values improved temporarily, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 22nd hospital day, leukocytes increased to 49,300/microliter and thrombocytes decreased to 10,000/microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow myeloblasts were also increased to 18.8%, and she was suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then, hematologic values improved simultaneously, and she was discharged in November 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the discharge, leukocyte count ranged from 6,000 to 16,500/microliter, but the number of bone marrow myeloblasts was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> appeared in association with decrease or absence of bone marrow megakaryocytes and rise of platelet associated-IgG, (PA-IgG) to 99.6 ng/10(7) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From September to December 1989, she complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, morning stiffness, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On serological findings, she was positive for LE cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, she was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> were shown on the chest roentgenogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>She received gamma-globulin administration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy, and mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> developed rapidly, and she died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, fibrinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo>, fibrinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the arcuate artery of the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of SLE complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with decrease of megakaryocytes and rise of the PA-IgG, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> associated with increased bone marrow myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
