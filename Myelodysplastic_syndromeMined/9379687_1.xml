<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HDMP treatment has been shown to stimulate some cytokines in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effect of HDMP treatment on serum levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) was evaluated in five children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkable increases in serum IL-2 levels were observed 3 and 7 days after HDMP (30 mg/kg per day) treatment in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte counts and serum IL-2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this preliminary study indicate that the use of short-course HDMP treatment might be beneficial to increase the serum IL-2 level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
