<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most important individual variables, isolated in a previous univariate analysis, were placed in a multiple regression modeling procedure to identify major prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis tends to identify prognostic variables containing significant predictive information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristics were examined on both continuous and binary bases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FAB classification was the first parameter entered in regression equations of both models, followed by platelet count, systemic symptoms, bone marrow blast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis confirms FAB classification as the best prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It supports the previously predictive value of platelet count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and bone marrow blast and recognizes the importance of systemic symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as prognostic characteristics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
