<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: t(8;21)(q22;q22), found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and occasionally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), results in the fusion of the AML1 gene on 22q22 to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> gene on 8q22, generating a chimeric AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> transcript, which is a molecular marker of the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with two pairs of nested AML1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> primers, was used to amplify the AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> fusion transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Kasumi-1 cell line was used as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 0.0001% (10(-6)), corresponding to detection of 0.5 picograms of leukemic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the presence of 0.5 micrograms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, patients with t(8;21) (three patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, one with therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>) yielded the same 222 base pair PCR product, suggesting that the breakpoints occurred at the same AML1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> introns as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients were still PCR-positive when in complete remission after chemotherapy and two experienced relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in another three patients with t(8;21) who were in remission for 2 months, 2 years, and 3 1/2 years, respectively, PCR was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RT-PCR is a sensitive method of detection of t(8;21), and is useful in the monitoring of minimal residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the junction of AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> appears to be constant, RT-PCR may offer a quick and accurate diagnosis of t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
