<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied eleven cases with the dic(17;20) or a more complex derivative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which showed deletion of 17p and 20q material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene TP53 was not always lost, supporting a more distal gene as the target of these 17p deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> derivatives could be interpreted as having initially been formed as a dicentric chromosome, those with a larger amount of material between the centromeres having undergone further rearrangement to stabilize the chromosome while retaining proximal 17p and proximal 20q material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that critical sequences on both 17p and 20q proximal to the sites of deletion must be retained during the critical 17p and 20q deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This would explain the excess of dicentric chromosomes resulting from 17;20 translocation, and the apparent stabilization of the unstable derivatives by further rearrangements which preserve 17p and 20q material </plain></SENT>
