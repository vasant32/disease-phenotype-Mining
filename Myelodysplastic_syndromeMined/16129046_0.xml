<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic precursors was assayed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51246">propidium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> staining and cell by FCM, and the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells were stained by cytochemical staining after culture </plain></SENT>
