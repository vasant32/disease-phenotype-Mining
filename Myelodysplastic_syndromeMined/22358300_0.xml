<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are mainly a disease of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Commonly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are treated in an outpatient setting making hematological/oncological private practices (PP) an important backbone in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To gain more insights into the characteristics of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated in hematological/oncological PP and to evaluate the daily diagnostic routines and classification systems used, we performed questionnaire-based analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to investigate whether characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in PP differ from patients treated in specialized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> centers in university hospitals (UH), we compared both cohorts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 197 patients in PP and 165 patients in UH were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in UH were significantly younger as compared to PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in UH, a greater proportion of patients with international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) higher risk were found, whereas patients with IPSS lower risk were more frequent in PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients in UH had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and platelet counts compared to PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that PP and UH are approached by different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient cohorts resulting in different diagnostic workups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
