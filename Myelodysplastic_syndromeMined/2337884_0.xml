<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells into macrophage-like cells upon induction by 12-0-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) was accompanied by rapid induction of the expression of 6-1E and 7-3G genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of expression of the 9-5C gene were not altered during macrophage-monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of the 6-1E and/or 7-3G gene was induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in four of 6 samples derived from patients who achieved complete remission, but not in any of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples from patients who failed to achieve complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that expression of the 6-1E and 7-3G genes is related to macrophage-monocytic differentiation and that alterations of these gene expressions in fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells after one hour of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment are of prognostic significance in predicting the response to therapy </plain></SENT>
