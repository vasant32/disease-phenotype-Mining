<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Duplication of the MLL gene (localized to 11q23) has been found on one chromosome 11 in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11, detected by DNA techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated copy number of MLL in seven patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 to see if duplication could be assessed by the detection of two separate signals on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If so, FISH could provide a quick easy screen of MLL status in routine referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic bone marrow aspirate showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 in five adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as part of a complex karyotype and in two children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) as part of a hyperdiploid karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization utilized the suspensions remaining after the cytogenetic harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two FISH probes were used on the adult patients (MLL - Oncor and Vysis), and one (Vysis) for the two children with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed that the proximity of the two putative hybridization signals made it very difficult to unambiguously see two separate signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hybridisations (Oncor probe) were convincing of MLL duplication (namely two distinct signals) in only one patient, but this was not borne out with the other MLL probe (Vysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that conventional FISH with MLL probe is not suited to act as a screen for MLL duplication in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 </plain></SENT>
