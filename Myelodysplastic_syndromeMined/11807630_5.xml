<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine a possible role of this agent in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA, we conducted a prospective randomized trial assessing the safety and efficacy of menatetrenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA were randomized to receive either 45 mg of oral menatetrenone (group 1) or no menatetrenone (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of menatetrenone was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients in group 1 (56%), five improved with menatetrenone treatment while only one (11%) of the group 2 patients improved </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ANC of group 1 patients rose after treatment, while that of group 2 patients decreased slightly at follow-up after 16 weeks ( p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
