<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LDARC was administered by subcutaneous injection every 12 hours at a dose of 10 mg/m2 (regimen A) or at a dose of 20 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) or continuous subcutaneous injection (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>) (regimen B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 22 courses, two elderly patients with ANLL (M4 and M5) and one M4 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> obtained complete remission (CR) and three elderly patients with ANLL (one M1 and two M2) and one patient with ANLL developed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation obtained partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
