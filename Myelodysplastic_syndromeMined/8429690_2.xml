<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 18 patients, 2 patients had an increased serum IL-2 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the proliferation of blasts in most cases, including the two patients having a high serum IL-2 level, was not stimulated by IL-2, the blasts of one case apparently proliferated in response to IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also clearly shown that IL-2-stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) showed cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts, whereas the PBMNC of the advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were usually defective in regard to this IL-2-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic usefulness of IL-2 or lymphokine-activated killer cells for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was not established by the present study </plain></SENT>
