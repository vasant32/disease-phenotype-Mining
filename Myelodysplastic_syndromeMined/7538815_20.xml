<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the hematologic effects of recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6, Escherichia coli, SDZ ILS 969, IL-6), and determine its toxicity profile, we performed a phase I trial of IL-6 in 22 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), platelet counts &lt; 100,000/microL, and &lt; 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received one of four doses of IL-6 (1.0, 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 micrograms/kg/d) as a subcutaneous injection on day 1, followed by a 7-day wash-out period, and then 28 days of IL-6 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003155'>elevated alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> were seen at 5.0 micrograms/kg/d; the maximum tolerated dose was 3.75 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced at least grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (36%) experienced at least a transient improvement in platelet counts; three fulfilled the criteria for response, whereas five others had clinically significant increases that failed to meet response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various IL-6-related toxicities prevented more than three patients from receiving maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients who received maintenance IL-6 therapy had a persistent increase in platelet counts, during 3 and 12 months of IL-6 therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies indicated that IL-6 increased the frequency of higher ploidy megakaryocytes but did not significantly increase the number of assayable megakaryocytic progenitor cells, suggesting that IL-6 acts as a maturational agent rather than a megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although IL-6 therapy can promote thrombopoiesis in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, its limited activity and significant therapy-related toxicity preclude its use as a single agent in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies, combining low doses of IL-6 with other hematopoietic growth factors, are underway </plain></SENT>
