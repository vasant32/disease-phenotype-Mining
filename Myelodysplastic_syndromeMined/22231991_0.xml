<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is a conglomerate of diseases in which bone marrow-derived cells die before or shortly after entering circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to define the perioperative mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our experience of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at our institution over the past 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and survival information were collected, and those who underwent any procedure requiring general anesthesia were defined as the operative subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 169 patients identified, 39 (23%) were in the operative subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 17.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate for the operative group was 23% (N = 9) and 30.8% (N = 12) at 30 and 60 days post-procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (59%) had an urgent/emergent indication for operation, which was associated with higher 60-day mortality (N = 12, 48%) compared to those with elective indications (N = 1, 7%) (P = 0.037, Chi-square) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several other factors (age, gender, International Prognostic Score, MDACC score, and major/minor procedure type) were not associated with perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are poor with expected survival less than 2 years and high postoperative mortality in the setting of urgent/emergent operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While maybe not prohibitive, we believe it is an imperative part of the informed consent process particularly for urgent/emergent procedures </plain></SENT>
