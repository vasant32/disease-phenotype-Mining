<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding these cytokines are significantly polymorphic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether these cytokine polymorphisms are associated with, and may therefore be playing a role in the pathogenesis of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if certain polymorphisms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) cytokines are overrepresented in a cohort of patients with MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate of 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotypes for 4 different polymorphisms, 2 in TNFalpha and 2 in TGFbeta1, were determined using single-specific-primer polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The allele and genotype frequencies were compared with similar populations in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute SNP500 database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population, the -308A/A genotype of the TNFalpha gene and the TGFbeta1 allele +29T and genotype +29T/T, each associated with higher levels of expression, were overrepresented in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms associated with increased expression in the cytokines TNFalpha and TGFbeta1 are overrepresented in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population suggesting that increased TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 activity may contribute to the susceptibility and/or pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm our observation </plain></SENT>
