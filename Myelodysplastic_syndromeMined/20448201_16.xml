<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By expressing EVI1 in murine bone marrow (BM), we previously described a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) model characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, dysmegakaryopoiesis, dyserythropoiesis, and BM failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mice invariably died 11-14 months after BM transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that a double point mutant EVI1-(1+6Mut), unable to bind Gata1, abrogates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the mouse and re-establishes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> megakaryopoiesis, erythropoiesis, BM function, and peripheral blood profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> features were maintained in the reconstituted mice until the study was ended at 21 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also report that EVI1 deregulates several genes that control cell division and cell self-renewal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In striking contrast, these genes are normalized in the presence of the EVI1 mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, EVI1, but not the EVI1 mutant, seemingly deregulates these cellular processes by altering miRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the silencing of miRNA-124 by DNA methylation is associated with EVI1 expression, but not that of the EVI1 mutant, and appears to play a key role in the up-regulation of cell division in murine BM cells and in the hematopoietic cell line 32Dcl3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results presented here demonstrate that EVI1 induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the mouse through two major pathways, both of which require the interaction of EVI1 with other factors: one, results from EVI1-Gata1 interaction, which deregulates erythropoiesis and leads to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, whereas the other occurs by interaction of EVI1 with unidentified factors causing perturbation of the cell cycle and self-renewal, as a consequence of silencing miRNA-124 by EVI1 and, ultimately, ensues in BM failure </plain></SENT>
