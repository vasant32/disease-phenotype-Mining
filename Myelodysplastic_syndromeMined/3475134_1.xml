<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Positive blasts were identified in 7 of the 15 cases with at least one of three antibodies reactive with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelomonocytic leukaemic cells (PMN-6, PMN-29, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 2-23) which were non-reactive with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 of these cases increased PM-81 positivity was associated with expression of at least one of the other antigens (PM-81 antibody reacts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid leukaemic cells and a certain percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest an aberration of myeloid differentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> which is reflected in altered surface marker features </plain></SENT>
