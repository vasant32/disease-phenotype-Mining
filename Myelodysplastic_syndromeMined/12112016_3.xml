<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) is a hematopoietic cell specific nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MNDA and other related gene products interact with and alter the activity of a large number of proteins involved in regulating specific gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MNDA and related genes exhibit expression characteristics, which suggest functions unique to specific lineages of cells, in addition to mediating the effects of interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells of the human K562 myeloid line do not express MNDA and are relatively immature compared to lines that express MNDA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, U937, and THP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that MNDA influences the expression of specific genes was tested by creating MNDA expressing K562 cells using stable retroviral mediated gene transfer followed by evaluation of transcription profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two macroarrays containing a total of 2,350 cDNAs of known genes showed a specific up-regulation of Dlk1 expression in MNDA expressing K562 cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed an average of over 3- and 7-fold upregulation of Dlk1 in two clones of MNDA expressing K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects on Dlk1 were also confirmed by Northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dlk1 is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and abnormal expression is a proposed marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional screening of transcription profiles after induced erythroid and megakaryoblastic differentiation showed no additional gene transcripts altered by the presence of MNDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MNDA alters expression of a gene essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
