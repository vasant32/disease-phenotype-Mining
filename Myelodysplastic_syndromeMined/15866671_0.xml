<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reducing transplant-related mortality (TRM), a major complication of SCT, to improve long-term survival, therefore, is one of the main objectives of transplantation teams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed TRM and overall survival (OS) over the years in children undergoing SCT in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From June 1998 to October 2002, 156 consecutive children, 105 boys and 51 girls, median age 10 years (range, 2-18), with different diagnoses underwent SCT (100 autologous and 56 allogeneic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OS and TRM were analyzed in 2 different periods (June 1989-December 1998 and January 1999-October 2002) and grouped according to the different SCT modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autologous TRM showed a statistically significant improvement within 1999-2002 (0%) compared with 1989-1998 (12.2%) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences for allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS was 34% in the first period and 80.4% in the second period (P &lt; .01), the improvement being for both autologous and allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our study, TRM decreased significantly for those children receiving autologous SCT in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly better in the latter period (1999-2002), both globally and for each SCT modality </plain></SENT>
