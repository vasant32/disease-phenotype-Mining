<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is closely correlated with cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no factor is available which is able to reliably stimulate megakaryopoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the ligand of the mpl receptor was cloned and found to be thrombopoietin (TPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured endogenous TPO serum levels in 69 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using an TPO receptor-based ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 12 from RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 25 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transition (RAEBt), and six from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This assay uses a chimeric molecule consisting of the human TPO receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgG as the capture reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biotinylated antibody to TPO IgG was used for detection and the lower detection limit in serum was found to be 160 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Samples obtained from healthy individuals with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet number were shown to be below detectable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with RA, high endogenous serum TPO concentrations correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> and significantly elevated TPO concentrations were only found when megakaryopoiesis was absent or decreased in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This correlation was not detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and RAEBt patients and no detectable TPO serum concentrations were found in six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients whether they showed decreased or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data show that endogenous TPO production is upregulated by decreased circulating platelet count only in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> where the leukemic clone has further progressed, an inadequate TPO response occurs, possibly due to overexpression of the mpl receptor by the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
