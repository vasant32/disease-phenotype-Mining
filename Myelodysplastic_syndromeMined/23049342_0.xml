<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the importance of cytogenetics has grown in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> is a drug that has well-known cytogenetical effects and is approved in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no studies have been performed to evaluate the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on the chromosomes of patients with hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on chromosomes of patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> using G-band analyses to identify possible cytogenetical alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The peripheral blood of 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and 18 controls was collected in heparinized tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> was added, at a final concentration of 10-5M, to cultures 7 hours prior to harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uncoiled centromeric/pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes-1, 9 and 16 occurred more frequently in the patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This higher frequency of uncoiled heterochromatin was statistically significant (p-value = 0.004) for chromosome-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we observed that the fragile site at 19q13 was more frequent in controls (p-value = 0.0468) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that satellite sequences, located in the heterochromatin of chromosome-9, are hypomethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This hypomethylation may contribute to the disease, activating transposable elements and/or promoting genomic instability, enabling the loss of heterozygosity of important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An investigation of the 19q13 region may help to understand whether or not the predominant occurrence of the fragile site at 19q13 in controls is due to hypermethylation of this region </plain></SENT>
