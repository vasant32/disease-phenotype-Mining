<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by Annexin V, whereas expression of genes was determined using a multiprobe RNase Protection System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between caspases 8, 5, 3, 2, 1 and the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>bfl1 and mcl1 levels were significantly higher in patients with BM blasts &gt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with ratio of bid expression &gt;1 compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pool were associated with IPSS values &lt; or =1 </plain></SENT>
