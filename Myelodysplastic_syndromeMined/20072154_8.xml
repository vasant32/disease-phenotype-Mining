<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remain poorly defined, but several studies have reported the NKT cell compartment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is deficient in number and functionally defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In support of a central role for NKT cells, a pilot clinical study reported that lenalidomide (an approved treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) <z:mp ids='MP_0008039'>increased NKT cell numbers</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and several in vitro studies showed lenalidomide specifically promoted NKT cell proliferation and cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested this in a much larger study and confirm a moderate in vitro augmentation of some NKT cell functions by lenalidomide, but find no impact on the NKT cell compartment of patients treated with lenalidomide, despite a consistently positive clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further show that the frequency and cytokine production of NKT cells is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> before treatment and remains stable throughout 10 months of lenalidomide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data challenge the concept that NKT cell defects contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and show that a clinical response to lenalidomide is not dependent on modulation of NKT cell frequency or function </plain></SENT>
