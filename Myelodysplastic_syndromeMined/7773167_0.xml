<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients are disease-free survivors between 1.8 and 11.3 years (median 6.1 years) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median Karnofsky performance status of the survivors is 100%, and only 2 have a performance status of &lt; 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients relapsed and the remaining 37 died without evidence for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality rates are 40%, 29%, and 44%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial relapse rate was higher among patients with excess blasts at the time of transplantation compared to those without excess blasts (49% vs. 4%, p = 0.0001), resulting in a lower disease-free survival (31% vs. 54%, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing age was associated with a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, younger age, shorter disease duration, and absence of excess blasts were associated with improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with appropriate marrow donors, especially patients less than age 40, undergo marrow transplantation early during the disease course, before the disease progresses or life-threatening complications develop </plain></SENT>
