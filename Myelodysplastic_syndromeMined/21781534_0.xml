<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the preventative effect of donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the relapsing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after haplotype hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), as well as its therapeutic effect and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: G-CSF was given at 5 - 10 µg×kg(-1)×d(-1) to donor and PBSCs were obtained on day 5 and frozen and allotted for storing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBSC infusion was given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 20 patients on day 90 after HSCT, and the second treatment was given to 4 patients on day 30 after the first infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), relapse rate of high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and long-term survival were evaluate after PBSC infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 19 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD after PBSC infusion for a median of 25 (12 - 60) months, 4 of them were ≥ degree III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rate was 22.9%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them accepted PBSC infusion twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had assessable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, 10 of them were restricted, and no one died of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients died of relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 11 patients survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> free, including 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the disease free survival rate of 2-year was 52.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prophylactic donor PBSC infusion mobilizing with G-CSF is effective, safe and feasible for the relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
