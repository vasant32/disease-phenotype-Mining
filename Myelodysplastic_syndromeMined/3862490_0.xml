<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the process <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells are suppressed and in time may become extinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This implies that neoplastic clones have a biological advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper evidence is presented that the cloning of granulocytic colony forming cells in the clonal hemopathies is influenced by cell products that regulate cloning of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony forming cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have attempted to develop an approach to the study of clone-clone interactions in order to determine at what level(s) the battle between clones is fought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future studies on relative responsiveness might help in understanding the mechanisms by which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoiesis is suppressed during the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and re-established during remission induction </plain></SENT>
