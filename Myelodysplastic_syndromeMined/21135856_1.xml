<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 20% of children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age at transplantation was 7 years and the median follow-up was 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The day-60 probability of neutrophil recovery was 76%; recovery was faster after transplantation of matched or 1-locus mismatched UCB, irradiation-containing conditioning regimen, cell dose &gt;6 Ã— 10(7)/kg and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 50% for transplantations after 2001 compared with 27% for the earlier period (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantations after 2001 occurred within 6 months after diagnosis and used UCB units with higher cell dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DFS was highest in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (61%) compared with other karyotypes (30%), P=0.017 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that transplantation of mismatched UCB graft is an acceptable alternative for children without a matched sibling or suitably matched unrelated adult donor </plain></SENT>
