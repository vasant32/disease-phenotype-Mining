<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not well defined and it appears that multiple genetic changes are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that certain chromosomal abnormalities may be influenced by environmental factors, while differences in the incidence of certain aberrations in different areas have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and the type of chromosomal changes in Greek primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single chromosomal abnormalities were focused on as possibly being primary changes implicated in the initiation of the neoplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using conventional cytogenetics, 239 MDS patients were studied and 63 cases were found with an abnormal karyotype (26.36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the cytogenetically abnormal cases, 46 patients presented single chromosomal abnormalities (73.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These aberrations were according to frequency +8 (28.57), del(5q), -7/del(7q) and +14 (6.35 each), i(17q) and del(11(q13) (4.76 each), +11, -Y, i(1q), del(8q), del(18p) and t(X;11) (1.59% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in Greek <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was lower than that reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common single anomaly was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, while a relatively high incidence of an isolated +14 was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, this is the first time an isolated i(1q) has been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
