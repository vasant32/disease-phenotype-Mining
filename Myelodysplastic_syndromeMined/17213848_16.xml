<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the trends in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) activity for children in Europe over the last three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed 31,713 consecutive paediatric HSCTs reported by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centres between 1970 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were taken from the EBMT registry and were compared according to period and centre category (paediatric or combined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 1996, there has been a significant increase in the number of HSCTs performed exclusively by paediatric centres, as well as in the number of alternative donor HSCTs, and in the use of peripheral blood stem cells (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of allogeneic HSCTs (allo-HSCTs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> remained stable, whereas it increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and decreased significantly for non-malignant diseases (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, human leukocyte antigen genoidentical donors, HSCT performed after 1996 and transplant centres performing more than 10 allo-HSCT/year were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with decreased transplant-related mortality (TRM) (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of autologus HSCTs (auto-HSCTs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> decreased significantly, whereas it increased for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that both auto-HSCT performed before 1996 and paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001) had higher TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications for paediatric HSCT have changed considerably during the last seven years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes provide tools for decision making in health-care planning and counselling </plain></SENT>
