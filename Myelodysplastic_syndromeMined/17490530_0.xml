<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma autoantibodies against GP IIb/IIIa and GP Ib/IX were measured by using a modified monoclonal antibody specific immobolization platelet antigens assay (MAIPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absorbance greater than mean value plus tripled standard deviation recorded from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were regarded as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the total positive rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 16.67% (5/30), the total positive rate in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was 46.67% (14/30), the difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> group was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that partial patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have plasma specific autoantibodies against platelet GP II b/III a and GP Ib/IX, indicating correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of patients with immune factors and the autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It provides a new basis for immunosuppression therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
