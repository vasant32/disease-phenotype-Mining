<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluates the role of quantitative measurement of peripheral lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4+ helper T-cell recovery, in predicting transplant outcomes including overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 69 allogeneic recipients were included with following diagnoses: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> 42, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> 5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 15, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 5 and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peripheral lymphocyte subset counts (CD3+ T cells, CD3+4+ helper T cells, CD3+8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells) were measured at 3, 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD4+ helper T-cell reconstitution at 3 months was strongly correlated with OS (P&lt;0.0001), NRM (P=0.0007), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> (P=0.0108) at the cutoff value of 200 x 10(6)/l CD4(+) helper T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid CD4+ helper T-cell recovery was also associated with a higher CD4+ helper T-cell transplant dose (P=0.006) and donor type (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An early CD4+ helper T-cell recovery at 3 months correlated with a subsequent faster helper T-cell recovery until 12 months, yet not with B-cell recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, rapid recovery of CD4+ helper T cells at 3 months was a favorable prognostic factor together with higher CD34+ cell transplant dose in terms of OS (P=0.001) and NRM (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
