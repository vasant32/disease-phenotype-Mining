<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> and analyzed cytogenetic changes in 155 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) from a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the total 155 MM patients with cytogenetic results, 7 patients showed de novo appearance of myeloid-related cytogenetic changes, and 5/7 had -7/7q-, including 3 with der(1;7)(q10;p10): 3 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (i.e. 2 patients with der(1;7)(q10;p10) and 1 with a complex abnormality including -5 and 7q-) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although morphologic identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was difficult in some cases, we concluded that the presence of 7q-, specifically der(1;7)(q10;p10), during chemotherapy involving melphalan for MM patients might indicate hidden <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> status and appropriate therapeutic options should be considered for such patients </plain></SENT>
