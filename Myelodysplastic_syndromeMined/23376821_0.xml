<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To substantiate evidence of whether immune interventions in patients with impending relapse, defined by incomplete lineage-specific <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, may prevent hematological relapse, we performed a retrospective nested case control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unsorted and lineage-specific <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> were measured in 134 patients </plain></SENT>
