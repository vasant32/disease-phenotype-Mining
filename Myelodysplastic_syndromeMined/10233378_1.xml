<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently the number of long-term survivors of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> has increased, with some of these cases evolving into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it is difficult to discriminate between aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it is unknown whether these patients have had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from the time of diagnosis of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence of ringed sideroblasts on an iron-stained bone marrow smear is a characteristic of some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amorphous electron-dense deposits in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrices of erythroid precursors observed with an electron microscope show ringed sideroblasts, and detection of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathology is useful for confirming the presence of ringed sideroblasts because this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathology can be found not only in erythroblasts but also in reticulocytes, which is particularly useful in cases in which few erythroblasts are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathology in two of nine children who had an initial diagnosis of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and in three children with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is unknown at present whether the first two children had aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> or hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results warrant further studies on more patients to confirm the significance of amorphous electron-dense deposits in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrices of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
