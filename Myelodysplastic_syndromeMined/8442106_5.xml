<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data clearly show that DRB1 allele typing was a good predictor of MLC reactivity and we believe that MLC testing in DRB1 allele mismatched unrelated pairs is not informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, our data suggest that MLC testing in DRB1 allele matched unrelated pairs is informative, because many such pairs produced weak but significant allostimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These weak MLC reactions may guide improvements in matching unrelated donors for BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, our MLC data suggest that it is important to match unrelated donors at DRB3 alleles for BMT </plain></SENT>
