<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria for this study were a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with less than 5% blast in peripheral blood, less than 10% blast in bone marrow and advanced cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 73 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 18 eligible and consecutive patients (8 men and 10 women), aged 48 to 87 years (median: 66.5 years) were assigned to receive mPSL pulse therapy (1,000 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, followed by tapering oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>; n= 12) or mPSL pulse with CsA therapy (4 to 5 mg/kg administered twice daily; n= 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of 18 patients (33.3%; 3 of 10 patients with RA, 2 of 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 1 of 2 patients with CMMoL) responded to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients responded to mPSL pulse alone, and two patients responded to mPSL pulse with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> and 5 of 12 patients with normocellular or hypercellular marrow responded to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> responded to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of response ranged from 4 to 59 months (median: 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a significant difference was observed between responders and nonresponders in the survival rate ( P&lt;0.05), no significant difference was found in clinical characteristics at entry between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In responders, mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were significantly increased ( P&lt;0.01), and the required red cell transfusion dose was significantly reduced ( P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is possible that immunosuppressive therapy might be effective for a certain subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
