<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the kinetics of T cell regenerative pathways after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, a thymus-dependent population, was very low until 3 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of CD28- T cells and CD8+ T cells expressing CD8alpha/alpha homodimer (CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells), a thymus-independent population, increased shortly after BMT, beyond the levels of healthy children in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of Vgamma9+Vdelta2+ and Valpha24+ T cells, which represent populations of extrathymic development, were less than 200/microl during the 6 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between the percentages of CD4+CD45RA+ and CD28-T cells at 1 month, and a positive correlation between the percentages of CD28- and CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells at 2 and 3 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at BMT was higher in patients with a high level of CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells than in those without an increase in these cells, suggesting the influence of thymic function on the regenerative pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the thymus-independent pathway is the dominant source of T cells even in children shortly after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
