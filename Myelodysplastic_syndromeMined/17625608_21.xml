<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The commonly deleted region (CDR) for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> has been identified as a 1.5-megabase interval on human chromosome 5q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied, by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR, the expression of 33 genes within the CDR that are known to be expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genes in the 5q- samples that showed the most pronounced decrease in expression compared to non-5q- samples were: solute carrier family 36, member 1 (SLC36A1; 89% downregulated), Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding (G3BP; 79%), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> protein 1 (ATOX1; 76%), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor precursor (CSF1R; 76%), ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14; 74%), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB; 73%), Nef-associated factor 1 (TNIP1; 72%), secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC; 71%), annexin VI (ANAX6; 69%), NSDT (66%) and TIGD (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further studied the hematopoietic system in SPARC-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mice showed significantly lower platelet counts compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were lower in mice lacking SPARC, differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPARC-null mice showed a significantly impaired ability to form erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences were found in the formation of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), granulocyte/monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) or megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Mk) in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that many of the genes within the CDR associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> exhibit significantly decreased expression and that SPARC, as a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
