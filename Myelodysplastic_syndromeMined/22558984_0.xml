<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The targeting sequence of SPARC gene which can be effectively silenced in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference was confirmed in our previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The designed and synthesized single-stranded primers were annealed to double-stranded oligo sequences and subcloned into linear pGCSIL-GFP lentiviral plasmid digested by enzyme Age I and EcoR I to produce GC-shSPARC lentiviraL vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After being identified by PCR and sequencing, plasmids GC-shSPARC with pHelper 1.0 and pHelper 2.0 were cotransfected into 293T cells to package lentiviral particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recombinant lentiviral vector was transfected into human SKM-1 cells, transfection efficiency was evaluated with expression of green fluorescent protein(GFP) determined by fluorescent microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of SPARC in SKM-1 cells was detected using RT-PCR and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A recombinant lentiviral vector, GC-shSPARC, expressing shRNAs targeting SPARC gene was constructed and confirmed by DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recombinant lentivirus was harvested from 293T cells with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> titer of 1Ã—10(9); TU/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GFP was observed in the 70% of SKM-1 cells after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was significantly reduced in the GC-shSPARC transfected group than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lentivirus RNAi vector targeting SPARC has been successfully constructed, and can effectively inhibit the expression of SPARC in SKM-1 cell line, which shed light on the foundation for researching the inhibition of SPARC siRNA target against human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells proliferation, induction <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and gene therapy </plain></SENT>
