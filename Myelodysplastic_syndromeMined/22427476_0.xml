<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> were excluded by serial CBC and bone marrow studies, medical and drug histories and immunological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were visited and examined monthly to evaluate their CBC and ANC (absolute neutrophil count), GCSF side effects and dosage adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were being done for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients for early detection of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From twenty two patients who enrolled this study, 16 patients regularly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were ten males and six females, range in age from 2 to 18 years old </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 24 to 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a period of 12-24 months before treatment, the mean of hospitalization frequency was 3.1 times and duration was 10 days; while during receiving treatment, they decreased to 0.2 times and 3 days, respectively (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also significant increase in mean ANC was observed during follow up (315/µl before treatment versus 1749/µl after 12 month regular treatment) </plain></SENT>
