<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old RhD-negative male with del(20q)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was transplanted with bone marrow from an HLA-identical RhD-positive sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic relapse was detected 21 months after stem cell transplantation (SCT), with reappearance of the original del(20q)-positive clone and reversion to recipient RhD-negative blood group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient received sequential donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), resulting in mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 2 years post DLI, the patient remains in a stable condition, despite a dominance of recipient-derived erythro- and granulopoiesis originating in del(20q)-carrying progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that reappearance of autologous erythropoiesis, upon relapse after allogeneic SCT, may be predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0002875'>erythropenia</z:mp> after DLI and that re-emerging autologous del(20q)-positive erythropoiesis post DLI can provide a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral red blood cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in patients relapsing after blood-group-mismatched transplantation, a possible reversion to recipient blood group should be considered prior to blood transfusion or DLI </plain></SENT>
