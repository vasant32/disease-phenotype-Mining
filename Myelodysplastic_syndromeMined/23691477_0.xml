<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the expression of delta-like 1 (DLK1) gene in the bone marrow cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and to explore its molecular characteristics for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the bone marrow cells of cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in the bone marrow cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (0.7342±0.3652) compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (0.4801±0.1759) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> had a positive correlation with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r=0.467, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly increased as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progressed (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal karyotypes exhibited significantly higher expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (0.9007±0.4334) than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes (0.6411±0.2630) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, patients with highly expressed DLK1 (≥0.8) presented significantly higher malignant clone burden (0.4134±0.3999) than those with lower DLK1 expression (&lt;0.8),(0.1517±0.3109), (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DLK1 gene was highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and was increased as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was positively correlated with the proportion of the bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high expression of DLK1 gene suggested a higher malignant clone burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
