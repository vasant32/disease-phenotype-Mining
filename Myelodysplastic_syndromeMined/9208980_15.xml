<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Sysmex R-3000 (TOA Medical Electronics, Kobe, Japan) evaluates maturation of reticulocytes by quantitating the fraction of reticulocytes within low-, middle-, and high-fluorescence intensity regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We defined the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) as the sum of the fraction of high-fluorescence intensity regions plus the fraction of middle-fluorescence intensity regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we studied the clinical significance of IRF in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> by comparing the IRF with the absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and with the reticulocyte production index (RPI) and by reviewing pertinent clinical information about the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study, 132 specimens from 102 patients undergoing evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using simple regression analysis, our results showed that the IRF has a weak but significantly positive correlation with ARC and with RPI, indicating that IRF is an additional useful parameter to evaluate the erythropoietic activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interpretation by integrating IRF and reticulocyte enumeration (ARC and RPI) provided useful information for further subclassification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased IRF (IRF &gt; or = 0.23) and increased ARC generally indicated an adequate erythroid response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but three specimens with an IRF less than 0.23 showed an RPI of 2 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These specimens were from patients with underlying diseases known to lead to decreased erythropoietic activity, predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specimens with a subnormal or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ARC (with a corresponding RPI &lt; or = 2) but with an IRF of more than 0.23 were from patients with various underlying conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>, sickle disease with crisis, pregnancy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that an IRF of 0.23 or less in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> reflects bone marrow that is nonresponsive or underresponsive to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with an increased IRF (IRF &gt; or = 0.23) may require further examination to clarify the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
