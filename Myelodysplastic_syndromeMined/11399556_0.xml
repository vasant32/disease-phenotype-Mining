<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the last 15 years, important progress has been made in the understanding of the biology and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk-adapted treatment strategies were established due to the high median age (60-75 years) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients and the individual history of the disease (number of cytopenias, cytogenetical changes, transfusion requirements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients currently offers the only potentially curative treatment, but this treatment modality is not available for the most of the "typical" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients aged &gt;60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on in-vitro findings analyzing the potential of several agents to differentiate or to stimulate hematopoietic progenitor cells a number of therapeutic options were evaluated in clinical trials: hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. erythropoietin, G-CSF), differentiation inducers (e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi>), or cytoprotective substances (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of immunsuppressive agents (antithymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A) either alone or in combination is being actively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using intensive cytotoxic treatment in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> complete remission rates comparable with those known from the treatment of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The therapy related toxicity (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate &lt;10%) was reduced by using G-CSF given prior ("Priming") and/or after the cytotoxic treatment </plain></SENT>
