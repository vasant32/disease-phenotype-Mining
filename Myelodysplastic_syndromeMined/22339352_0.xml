<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is becoming clear that epigenetic mechanisms are associated with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, a myriad of epigenetic alterations, including altered DNA methylation and aberrant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> post-translational modifications, have been linked with various conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most widely investigated example is the link between aberrant DNA methylation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> that has lead to the clinical use of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, defective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation status has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, providing the basis for the clinical use of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi> for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is an emerging association between perturbed fetal epigenetic programming and developmental origins of disease due to both nutritional and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, epigenetic events associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Related epigenetic mechanisms as well potential pharmacological and dietary interventions at critical periods of development form a large part of the discussion in this Forum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, this Forum provides an in-depth account of the association between epigenetic mechanisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> with a focus on disease prevention with dietary chromatin-modifying compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the association between aberrant epigenetic events and neurodegenerative conditions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), is becoming apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A research article in this Forum identifies a potential new polymorphism associated with one-carbon metabolism that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, this Forum provides a detailed account of known epigenetic processes in developmental programming and human disease </plain></SENT>
