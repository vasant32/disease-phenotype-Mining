<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most clinical studies have been conducted without any selection of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we report our experience with the use of rhEPO in a population of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> according to FAB criteria, without significant WBC and platelets reduction, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LDH and short history of disease were eligible for the study and were treated with rhEPO at a dosage of 150 mg/kg three times a week for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 so treated patients, 7 (58.3%) achieved complete remission, 2 partial remission and 3 failed to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This high response rate makes more than acceptable the cost/benefit ratio for rhEPO in RA patients and may identify a subgroup of patients that can be treated successfully with rhEPO alone </plain></SENT>
