<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are clonal diseases characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> of variable degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> is common and several morphologic and functional abnormalities of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) and/or monocytes have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these observations, the phagocytic and oxygen intermediates production of PMNs and monocytes was determined in a group of forty-seven patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> of varying severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rapid, simple and reliable flow cytometric method was developed to evaluate, in a one-step procedure, the phagocytosis rate and the oxidative burst in PMNs and monocytes using a small amount of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phagocytosis of PMNs and monocytes was not significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) a clear decrease (p &lt; 0.05) of this function was found in both PMNs and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The production of oxygen intermediates by PMNs and monocytes was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) reduced in RA as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the presence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> of a severe reduction in phagocytosis and oxygen intermediates production (two crucial functions to protect the host against pyogenic agents) in both PMNs and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation could explain the severe morbidity and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in patients affected by these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
