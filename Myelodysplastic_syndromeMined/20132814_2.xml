<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the host defense against invading microorganisms by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a number of endogenous molecules have been reported to be ligands of TLRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of these molecules are known to be expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue and activate intracellular signal pathways via TLRs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the expression dynamics of TLRs in the bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) during the course of transformation to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (OL) using real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow cells at the time of initial diagnosis tended to express higher levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 than control bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these TLRs, TLR9 exhibited a significant decrease of expression at the time of transformation to OL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of TLR9 and TNF-alpha showed significant correlation in bone marrow cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and OL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, TLR2 was mostly localized to neutrophils of the control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TLR4 was observed in a subset of neutrophils and a few mononuclear cells in control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, TLR4 was weakly expressed in nearly half of immature myeloid cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TLR9 was mainly localized to neutrophils in the control and RA bone marrow and strongly expressed in the immature myeloid cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> cases, although the blastic cells of OL cases did not express TLR9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibit frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while OL cells are prone to be immortal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, TLR9 might be associated with regulation of apoptotic/proliferative signals via TNF-alpha in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
