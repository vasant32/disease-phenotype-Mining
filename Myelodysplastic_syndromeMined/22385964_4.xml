<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular components that control stem cell responses to DNA damage remain to be delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using in vivo RNAi screens, we identified basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) as a major component limiting self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) in response to telomere dysfunction and γ-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA damage induces BATF in a G-CSF/STAT3-dependent manner resulting in lymphoid differentiation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BATF deletion improves <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal and function in response to γ-irradiation or telomere shortening but results in accumulation of DNA damage in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of bone marrow from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> supports the conclusion that DNA damage-dependent induction of BATF is conserved in human <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results provide experimental evidence that a BATF-dependent differentiation checkpoint limits self-renewal of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
