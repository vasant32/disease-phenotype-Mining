<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were analyzed for dysmegakaryopoiesis (DMP) in the bone marrow by alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique and by conventional May-Giemsa staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the immunocytochemical study, monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP) IIb/IIIa was utilized to demonstrate megakaryocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>91% (21/23) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were detected as having DMP by APAAP method, while only 52% (12/23) were detectable by Giemsa stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were difficulties in recognizing small micromegakaryocytes (micro MKs), designated as type 1 atypical MKs, by Giemsa staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, megakaryoblasts (MKBs) were detectable only by APAAP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, no type 1 and type 3 atypical MKs (round shaped multinuclear MKs) were observed either by Giemsa staining or by the APAAP method, suggesting that they are a distinctive feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the necessity of immunocytochemical technique for accurate recognition of DMP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
