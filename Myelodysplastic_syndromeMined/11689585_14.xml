<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a thrombopoietic cytokine that attenuates postchemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at doses of 50 microg/kg/d subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about the activity of IL-11 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our preliminary experience with IL-11 at doses of 50 microg/kg/d suggested that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> developed significant peripheral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> after the prolonged dosing necessary for treating these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, initiated a study of low-dose IL-11 (starting dose, 10 microg/kg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were assessable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had diploid cytogenetics; the others had a variety of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six (38%) of 16 patients showed a platelet response to IL-11, and two had a multilineage response (to IL-11 alone, n = 1; to IL-11 plus G-CSF and erythropoietin, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median increase in peak platelet counts was 95 x 10(9)/L above baseline in the responders (range, increase of 55 x 10(9)/L to 130 x 10(9)/L above baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responders included five of 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and one of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response durations were 12, 13, 14+, 25, 30, and 30+ weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Side effects of IL-11 were mild (peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, n = 7; conjunctival injection, n = 7; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, n = 1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had no side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our pilot study suggests that administration of low-dose IL-11 (10 microg/kg/d) can raise platelet counts without significant toxicity in selected thrombocytopenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
