<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases, caused by either mutation or gene fusion, is of major importance for the development of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, particularly myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that hitherto unrecognized, cytogenetically cryptic tyrosine kinase fusions may be common in non-classical or atypical myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and related myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To detect genomic copy number changes associated with such fusions, we performed a systematic search in 68 patients using custom designed, targeted, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arrays contained 44,000 oligonucleotide probes that targeted 500 genes including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 90 tyrosine kinases plus downstream tyrosine kinase signaling components, other translocation targets, transcription factors, and other factors known to be important for myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No abnormalities involving tyrosine kinases were detected; however, nine cytogenetically cryptic copy number imbalances were detected in seven patients, including hemizygous deletions of RUNX1 or CEBPA in two cases with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the remaining alleles revealed non-mutated RUNX1 and a frameshift insertion within CEBPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further mutation screen of 187 patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> identified RUNX1 mutations in 27 (14%) and CEBPA mutations in seven (4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of other transcription factors known to be frequently mutated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> revealed NPM1 mutations in six (3%) and WT1 mutations in two (1%) patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis indicated that patients with mutations had a shorter overall survival (28 versus 44 months, P=0.019) compared with patients without mutations, with the prognosis for cases with CEBPA, NPM1 or WT1 mutations being particularly poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that mutations of transcription and other nuclear factors are frequent in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and are generally mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CEBPA, NPM1 or WT1 mutations may be associated with a poor prognosis, an observation that will need to be confirmed by detailed prospective studies </plain></SENT>
