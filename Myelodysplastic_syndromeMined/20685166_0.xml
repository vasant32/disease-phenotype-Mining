<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valid alternative to be used in transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the use of stem cells depends on the small number of cells available; this is the reason why UCB can be used only in very <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low-weight</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have evaluated the efficacy of cellular manipulation before transplant and in particular, before thawing the units through the Rubinstein method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have evaluated the results obtained after thawing 40 UCB to be used for as many patients affected by several pathologies (21 ALL, 6 AML, 3 MDS, 2 LNH, 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath>, 2 β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, 1 Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, 1 Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 1 Wiskott-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aldrich syndrome</z:e> and 1 Omenn syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After thawing, nucleated cells (NC) mean recovery was 76.81% (SD±15.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quantity of NC obtained was 124.29×107 (SD±43.18) and in only 5 cases the number of NC after the procedure was lower than the requested graft dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the last ones, in two cases only we did not achieve the target after manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-manipulation cellular viability was 83.48% (SD±10.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the units shipment complied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the necessary procedures; in fact the temperature never rose above -120°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study we highlighted the efficacy of UCB thawing technique, with the same method defined in 1995 at the New York Blood Centre that guarantees an excellent NC recovery and maintains a high level of cell viability </plain></SENT>
