<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were administered the CHG regimen comprising low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (25 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), homoharringtonine (1 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), and G-CSF (300 microg/day, subcutaneous injection, days 0-14, interrupted when the peripheral white blood cell count reached &gt;20 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 71.9% after the administration of one course of the CHG regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 patients, 15 (46.9%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 8 (25%) achieved partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This regimen was followed by a post-remission therapy that included conventional chemotherapy, when CR was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with CR who just received post-remission regimens as homoharringtonine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (HA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) 6 relapsed rapidly and just had a mean 6.1 months of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the other 8 out of 14 patients with CR alternatively received subsequent chemotherapy, which combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, pirarubicin, or aclarubicin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CR duration of the 8 patients had reached 10.6 months, and 5 of the 8 still kept a continuous CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences for CR, PR, and OS when the patients were grouped by age, blasts in bone marrow, and karyotypes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
