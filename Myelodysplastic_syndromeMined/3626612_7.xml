<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the hemopoietic cell from which malignant change evolves in juvenile dyshemopoiesis with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two male patients, aged 18 and 5 months, were studied using progenitor assays combined with cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, cytopenias and a cellular marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The karyotype in direct marrow was 45,XY-7/47,XY,+8/46,XY in patient 1 and 45,XY,-7/46,XY in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 received chemotherapy but developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after 17 months and died 20 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this time marrow metaphases with 45,XY,-7 increased to 100% (25/25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 received an allogeneic marrow transplant 4 months after diagnosis which did not engraft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients progenitors of both small (CFU-E) and large (BFU-E) erythroid colonies were present at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the colonies produced were small and poorly hemoglobinized with some erythropoietin-independent maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progenitors of large granulocyte/macrophage colonies (CFU-GM) were present at an elevated frequency in the marrow of patient 1 and in the blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> progenitor classes were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of colonies from this patient showed BFU-E to be 45,XY,-7 or 47,XY,+8 and CFU-GM to be 45,XY,-7 or 47,XY,+8 or 46,XY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patient 2, most BFU-E were 45,XY,-7, although a few were 46,XY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that malignant change in this disease involves hemopoietic stem cells capable of erythroid and in at least some cases, myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
