<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median survival for the whole group of patients was 22 months (RA 61.7 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> 31.6 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> 15.7 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 10.3 months, and RAEBt 8.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 37 of the 70 patients investigated (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the differences in survival between patients with complex versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype were statistically significant (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of small blastic cells, located away from the endosteal surface (abnormal localization of immature blasts or ALIP) appears to be a major prognostic factor in predicting the duration of survival and progression to ANLL, especially in the FAB subgroups RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival for the 22 ALIP- cases with RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> was 65 months, compared with 31 months for the ALIP+ cases (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine ALIP+ patients (53%) developed ANLL in contrast to 3 (13%) of the ALIP- cases (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By redefining ALIP and evaluating the number and characteristics of the accompanying cells, histological subtypes were distinguished correlating largely with the FAB subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate the prognostic importance of bone marrow biopsy and quantifying the complexity of bone marrow chromosome changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
