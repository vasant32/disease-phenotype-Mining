<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background The PI3K-Akt pathway is frequently activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and represents an important therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 and perifosine are known to inhibit Akt activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods The primary objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of UCN-01 given in combination with perifosine in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perifosine 150 mg every 6 h was given orally on day 1 followed by 100 mg once a day continuously in 28-day cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UCN-01 was given intravenously over 3 h on day 4 at three dose levels (DL1 = 40 mg/m(2); DL2 = 65 mg/m(2); DL3 = 90 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Thirteen patients were treated (DL1, n = 6; DL2, n = 4; DL3, n = 3) according to a traditional "3 + 3" design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients at the DL3 experienced dose-limiting toxicity including grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo>, constitutional symptoms and grade 5 pneumonitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other frequent toxicities were grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MTD was determined to be UCN-01 65 mg/m(2) with perifosine 100 mg a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No appreciable direct Akt inhibition could be demonstrated in patients' mononuclear cells using Western blot, however, reduced phosphorylation of the downstream target ribosomal protein S6 in leukemic blasts was noted by intracellular flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No objective responses were observed on this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion UCN-01 and perifosine can be safely administered, but this regimen lacked clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This approach may have failed because of insufficient Akt inhibition in vivo </plain></SENT>
