<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neutrophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> encompass, among others, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> (SS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000999'>pyoderma</z:hpo> gangrenosum (PG), which are associated with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> including myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On skin biopsies from 16 patients with biopsy-proven SS and/or PG, we performed an X-inactivation assay to detect clonal restriction of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were two patient categories based on known diseases at the time of diagnosis: patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> and patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, clonal restriction was found in five; three were homozygous, precluding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the seven control patients, infiltrates were clonally restricted in five; one was polyclonal and the other was homozygous for the allele, precluding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the five patients with clonally restricted infiltrates, one was subsequently diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, one had unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and an additional patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the incidence of clonality in both groups was the same, averaging 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that clonality in neutrophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e>, while characteristic of underlying myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasia</z:e>, is not observed exclusively in the setting of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of clonal neutrophilic infiltrates unassociated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> is unclear, but it may have some implications regarding the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> neutrophilic infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clonality is well described in the setting of lymphomatoid hypersensitivity, reflecting an overzealous response to antigenic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One could speculate a similar mechanism operational in cases of apparently reactive SS/PG associated with monoclonality; a localized form of cutaneous neutrophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasia</z:e> is also possible </plain></SENT>
