<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonality was assessed by PCR amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats of the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (HUMARA) gene and by investigation of silent polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33820">iduronate</z:chebi> sulphatase (IDS) or p55 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of results in a control group of 20 healthy age related females, a ratio of at least 9:1 between the two alleles was considered a significant marker of monoclonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 11 patients with advanced forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) had clonal granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with early disease, only 2 out of 11 patients (18%) with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, according to WHO classification, had clonal granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow and 2 other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> exhibited extremely oligoclonal granulocyte subpopulation in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found clonal granulocytes in 12 out of 14 patients (86%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) and 8 of them simultanously exhibited clonal CD14(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated 3 years survival of patients with early disease and clonal cell subpopulations was 61% as compared with 88% in patients without clonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Karyotype abnormalities were detected in 11 of the 25 females with early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonal patterns were present in 7 out of 8 patients with abberations diagnosed by routine cytogenetics, nevertheless, FISH revealed 5q deletion in 3 patients without signs of clonality in XCIP assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the presence of clonal subpopulations and the degree of telomere shortening in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite some limitations, the measurement of XCIP remains a sensitive tool for diagnosis of the first transforming mutation in the clonal development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> especially when combined with FISH and when an age related group is used to establish an appropriate allele ratio to exclude constitutional or acquired skewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of clonal cell subpopulations in most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients in contrast to RA may reflect a proposed multistep pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with dysplastic changes limited to erythropoiesis in early step and with subsequent development of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results also support the usefulness of separation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> from 'pure' RA; however, a more complex insight combining different molecular techniques performed in a large number of patients is needed for refined classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on the basis of new molecular prognostic factors and for indication of more effective targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
