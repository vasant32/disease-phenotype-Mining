<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: S-bromodeoxyuridine-SCD and karyotyping studies were performed in 50 cases with clinically suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prolonged cell cycle time (CT) was found in 33 of the 50 cases (66.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had prolonged CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only 2 (10.5%) of the 19 cases with nonmalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> had prolonged CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences of CT between the cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and benign hypercellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> as well as healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between healthy individuals and cases with AA and, with benign hepercellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT gradually prolonged during the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>24 of the 50 patients (48.0%) were found to have clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In seven cases not compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to FAB criteria, six were found to have clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates were 11.8 and 50.0% in the groups of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCD and of prolonged SCD, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation in both the groups were 5.9% and 16.7% (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival of both the groups was 12 months and 8 months (P = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SCD analysis is valuable for establishing the diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
