<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum protein were isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), and the electrophoresis gels were obtained to identify the differentially reacting protein spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The replica gels of the differentially reacting proteins were analyzed to locate the matching protein spots, which were identified by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprint based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database searching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven differentially expressed proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> were found by 2-DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 proteins, 4 were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS to have significantly differential expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, including dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP/CD26), polymerase (DNA directed) kappa, PRO2044 and an albumin-like protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 2-DE-based serum proteome profiling helps identify serum proteomic biomarkers related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DDP/CD26 has increased expression in the serum in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> subtype <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, suggesting its possible role in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
