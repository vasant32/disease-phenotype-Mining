<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using FISH with a panel of DNA probes we detected loss of a common region of 12p in 22 patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of them were characterized cytogenetically by a del(12p), seven by unbalanced translocations, and in the remaining cases the loss of the 12p region was masked by translocations and insertions, adding extra material to the short arm of chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The smallest commonly deleted region found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases analyzed included ETV6, the gene for p27kipl (CDKN1B), and the D12S178 marker </plain></SENT>
