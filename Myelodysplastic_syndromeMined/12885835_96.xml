<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 1,261 patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> before age 41 between 1965 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete until October 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, the cause was known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term cause-specific mortality was compared with general population rates to assess relative risk (RR) and absolute excess risk (AER) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 17.8 years, 534 patients had died (55% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> was 6.8 times that of the general population, and still amounted to 5.1 after more than 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RRs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (STs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) were increased overall (RR = 6.6 and 6.3, respectively), but especially in patients treated before age 21 (RR = 14.8 and 13.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When these patients grew older, this elevated mortality decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall AER of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from causes other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> increased throughout follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving salvage chemotherapy had a significantly increased RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from STs, compared to patients receiving initial therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but after 20 years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> mortality was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The RRs and AERs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e> (SCs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> continued to increase after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even more than 30 years after diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients experienced elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
