<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently proposed a scoring system for risk assessment in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this score, one point is allocated to each of the following four parameters: bone marrow blasts &gt; or = 5%, LDH &gt; 200 U/l, hemoglobulin concentration &lt; or = 9 g/dl, and platelet count &lt; or = 100 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a published series of 235 untreated patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, three prognostic groups (group A, score 0; group B, score 1 or 2; group C, score 3 or 4) were identified which differed significantly in both survival and rates of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to reexamine the usefulness of our scoring system by applying it to an independent population of 263 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological subtypes were RA in 53 (20%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> in 32 (12%), pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (PSA) in 41 (16%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in 60 (23%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T in 34 (13%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in 43 cases (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of the Düsseldorf score could be assessed in 244 of 263 patients (initial LDH levels or platelet counts lacking in 19 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were assigned to group A (low risk), 132 to group B (intermediate risk), and 70 to group C (high risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-year cumulative survival was 86% in group A, 57% in group B and 14% in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative survival was 53, 26 and 0%, respectively (p &lt; 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 2 years after diagnosis was 3% in group A, 12% in group B, and 41% in group C (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional validation of the score was provided by extended follow-up of the initial patient population on which the scoring system was based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival curves in this patient population developed as predicted by the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An important advantage of the Düsseldorf score is its ability to identify high-risk patients among the RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> subgroups, even though by definition medullary blasts are less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of LDH levels as a prognostic parameter also qualifies the Düsseldorf score for a correct assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the new study population, LDH was confirmed as an important prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, actuarial survival for patients with LDH levels &lt; or = 200 U/l was 61%, compared with 34% for patients with LDH &gt; 200 U/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative survival was 32 and 14%, respectively (p &lt; 0.00005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
