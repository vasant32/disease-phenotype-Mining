<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we analyzed the tumoristatic potential of a distinct peripheral blood monocyte-derived MDC subset which co-expressed PDC-specific marker CD123 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD123(+) MDCs represented a subset of small-sized DCs and accounted for 45-60% of peripheral blood monocytes cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukine-4 (IL-4) for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They exhibited more significant antiproliferative activity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumor</z:e> cell lines of Jurkat, HL60, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than CD123(-) MDCs even at a low effecter/target ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of MDC and their supernatant with TRAIL-R2:Fc significantly reduced the tumoristatic effect of CD123(+) MDCs but not of CD123(-) MDCs and their supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD123(+) MDCs expressed higher level of cytoplasmic TNF-alpha-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand (TRAIL) than CD123(-) MDCs, whereas both expressed very little surface and soluble TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that CD123(+) cells represented a predominant subset of MDCs generated from peripheral blood monocytes in vitro, characterized by their potential tumoristic activity partially via cytoplasmic TRAIL </plain></SENT>
