<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may coincide with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients with paravertebral mass lesions representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> are presented along with a review of the literature on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: A 76-year-old male with a known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, he had symptoms of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cauda equina syndrome</z:e> with complaints of pain and hypesthesia of the lower limbs as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 63-year-old female presented with aggravated complaints of the lower thorax, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> radiating to the upper left leg, and dysesthesia of both feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In her past medical history, she had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera and a splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed paravertebral and intraspinal lesions located in the thoracic and sacral spine which were regarded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> according to the imaging findings in MRI and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy showed marked improvement in their neurologic complaints following the initial sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation, knowledge of the underlying disease and of imaging findings are essential in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI is the imaging modality of choice in the primary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Possible extension of the disease into the intraspinal space can be evaluated with high accuracy and differential diagnosis can be facilitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, MRI is of use in the accurate planning of radiation fields as well as during follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
