<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM-induced colony formation were comparable to that of G-CSF-induced colony growth, both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colony formation was found to be delayed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The delay in colony formation was most apparent in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM (G-CSF) responsive progenitor cell compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with clinical features of high risk disease, this delay was more pronounced as compared with low risk cases (7 and 3 days, respectively, in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delay in colony formation was found to be caused by an increase in the time interval before progenitor cells had begun to divide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a prolongation of the time spent in G0 of myeloid progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be the cause of the indolent in vitro colony formation observed in this disease </plain></SENT>
