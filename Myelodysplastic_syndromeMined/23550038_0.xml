<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the predictive value of geriatric assessment (GA) on overall survival (OS) for older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients ≥ 60 years with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and planned intensive chemotherapy were enrolled at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment GA included evaluation of cognition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, distress, physical function (PF) (self-reported and objectively measured), and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective PF was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, timed 4-m walk, chair stands, standing balance) and grip strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were fit for each GA measure as a predictor of OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 74 patients, the mean age was 70 years, and 78.4% had an Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) score ≤ 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly shorter for participants who screened positive for impairment in cognition and objectively measured PF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for age, gender, ECOG score, cytogenetic risk group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> (Modified Mini-Mental State Exam &lt; 77) and impaired objective PF (SPPB &lt; 9) were associated with worse OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GA methods, with a focus on cognitive and PF, improve risk stratification and may inform interventions to improve outcomes for older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
