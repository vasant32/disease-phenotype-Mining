<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the hematological effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>, 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and one or more refractory cytopenias received treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> in a Phase I/II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cohorts received intravenous treatment with 100, 200, or 400 mg/m2 amifostine three times a week, or 740 mg/m2 weekly for three consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks observation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had a 50% or greater increase in absolute neutrophil count with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> treatment (range, 426 to 11,348/microL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Platelet count increased</z:e> in 6 (43%) of 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (absolute increase, 16, 000 to 110,000/microL), and 5 of 15 red blood cell transfusion-dependent patients had a 50% of greater reduction in transfusion needs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">Amifostine</z:chebi> doses less than or equal to 200 mg/m2 were well tolerated, whereas grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> was limiting at higher doses </plain></SENT>
