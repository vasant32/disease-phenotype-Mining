<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>-1 (WT1) gene in the different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and to explore the regularity of expression of WT1 gene in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transforming into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The method of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used, the levels of WT1 gene's presentation in different types of montagers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were analyzed, and the relationship between the level and the clinical characteristic was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the expression of WT1 gene in AL patients, post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-AL patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive rate of WT1 gene expression in 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 22.4 percent (11/49), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) was 0(0/13), RA with excess of blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) was 25.0 percent (6/24); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) was 41.7 percent (5/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of WT1 expression were gradually increased in three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of WT1 expression were higher in AL and post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-AL patients (48.5 percent, 32/66 and 50.0 percent, 4/8) than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no expression of WT1 gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a relatively high expression rate of WT1 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but relatively low expression rate in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method of RT-PCR, is high sensitiveness and specificity, can trustful be used in the progression of monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>' progression and its transformation into AL </plain></SENT>
