<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two genes are frequently methylated: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study methylation of these genes was studied in 63 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 2 with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN) and 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients were monitored during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six healthy donors were tested in a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) method with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated techniques was used for detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation was present in the CDKN2A gene in 38% and in the CDKN2B gene in 77% of the patients in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of methylation was higher in the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients - 77% in CDKN2A gene and 100% in CDKN2B gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, an aberrant methylation was associated with a tendency to disease progression towards more advanced forms according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in methylation level were observed between early and advanced forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in CDKN2B gene (P value &lt; 0.05) but not for CDKN2A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trend of methylation in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was analyzed in CDKN2B gene and correlated with the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased methylation was connected with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the methylation level of CDKN2B gene might be used as a marker of leukemic transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates the role of hypermethylation as an important event in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
