<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The outcome for 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in remission who had CAMPATH 1M T cell-depleted unrelated donor bone marrow transplantations (BMTs) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioning was mainly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (TBI) (14.4 Gy), but 5 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in place of TBI and 200 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received cyclosporin, and short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was given to recipients of mismatched grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient population was predominantly pediatric (median age, 10 years), but one third of the patients was aged 15 years or above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were in second complete remission (CR2), and 14 had high-risk CR1 disease (primarily failed remission induction or antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, often with complex cytogenetic abnormalities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both recipient and donor were cytomegalovirus seronegative in 15 of 37 cases (38%); 51% of patients were matched for HLA class I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in 24% of patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 5 of 31 evaluable patients (16%), 4 extensive and 1 limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in 5 cases (13%); 1 of these 5 patients survives, 24 months after a second unrelated donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these relapses were associated with secondary graft failure (incidence rate, 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted primarily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the major transplant-associated complication, with 12 episodes in 9 patients, 5 of them lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients survive at a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 2-102 months), with estimated actuarial overall and disease-free survival rates at 44 months of 61% (SE 8%) and 57% (SE 8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients are more than 2 years post-BMT and may be cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The functional status of long-term survivors is excellent, with 19 of 21 patients who survive 6 months or more in full-time employment or full-time students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These encouraging results suggest that in patients lacking a sibling donor, unrelated donor BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML in remission</z:e> achieves survival figures as good as or better than those reported on patients with autologous stem cell transplantation, and that T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of grafts is associated with a low relapse rate and an excellent functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, only a randomized study comparing unrelated donor BMT and auto-grafting will resolve which of these treatment strategies is better for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
