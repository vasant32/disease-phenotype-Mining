<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-Mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi>) has been regarded as nonleukemogenic, even though the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> depends on the incorporation of 6-thioguanine <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> (6TGN) into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In hematopoietic cells this pathway competes with S-methylation catalyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> methyltransferase (TPMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> metabolites inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> de novo synthesis and thus may enhance incorporation of 6TGN into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of white individuals have low TPMT activity as a result of polymorphisms in the TPMT gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors attempted to test the hypothesis that the degree of DNA damage during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> therapy might reflect variations in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> metabolism and pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors measured TPMT activity as well as erythrocyte levels of 6TGN (E-6TGN) and methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> metabolites (E-MeMP) during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> therapy in 439 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 5 of whom later developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients who developed sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had significantly lower TPMT activity compared with the remaining patients (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 55 patients with TPMT activity &lt;14 U/mL red blood cells (RBC) (antimode of the bimodal distribution) had a 5-year risk of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> of 9 +/- 6% versus 1 +/- 1% for the remaining patients (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified TPMT activity and E-MeMP level as the strongest predictors of risk for sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (global P value = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with low TPMT activity and high E-MeMP levels had the highest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients with sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had E-6TGN and/or E-MeMP levels &gt; the 90% percentiles or had TPMT activity &lt; 14 U/mL RBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an increased leukemogenic risk when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> is administered with other cytotoxic agents in patients with low TPMT activity, and indicate that not only high 6TGN levels but also high levels of methylated metabolites may lead to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
