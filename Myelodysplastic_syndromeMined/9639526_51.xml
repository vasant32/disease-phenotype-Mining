<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NF1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene encodes neurofibromin, which regulates the growth of immature myeloid cells by accelerating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15996">guanosine triphosphate</z:chebi> hydrolysis on Ras proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if the NF1 gene was involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> in children without a clinical diagnosis of NF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to screen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> marrows from 20 children for NF1 mutations that resulted in a truncated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis was used to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> point mutations in these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We confirmed mutations of NF1 in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, one of which also showed loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NF1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An NF1 mutation was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from the only patient tested and this suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> may be the presenting feature of NF1 in some children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Activating <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations were found in four patients; as expected, none of these samples harbored NF1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because 10% to 14% of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> have a clinical diagnosis of NF1, these data are consistent with the existence of NF1 mutations in approximately 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
