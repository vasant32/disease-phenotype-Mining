<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) in 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) consisting from 47 of RA, 1 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, and 2 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients showed various marrow cell types including hypo-, normo-, and hypercellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients belonged to the following International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups: 4 of low, 41 of intermediate-1, and 5 of intermediate-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median CsA dose was 4.58mg/kg, and treatment responses were classified according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological improvement (HI) was observed in 30 (60%) patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were belonged to RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, no efficacy was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (8%) of the responders achieved partial remission (PR) with granulocytes &gt; or = 1500microl(-1), Hb&gt;11g/dl and platelets &gt; or = 100,000microl(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher response rate (53%) was shown in erythroid lineage (HI-E) compared to platelet (HI-P, 36%) or neutrophil lineage (HI-N, 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed the correlation between the response to CsA therapy and the karyotype or HLA type, there were significantly more responders with good karyotype or DRB1*1501 than with intermediate/poor karyotypes or with other HLA types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the usefulness of CsA therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with any marrow cellularity, especially for erythroid lineage and patients with good karyotype or DRB1*1501 </plain></SENT>
