<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that Asian and Western <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients have different cytogenetic and prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and cytogenetic data from 435 Chinese adult primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the prognostic value of the World Health Organization classification as well as six prognostic scoring systems in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 25.1 months (5.5-53.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 435 patients, 186 (42.8%) had died and 40 (9.2%) had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified older age, higher percent of marrow blasts, and poor-risk IPSS cytogenetics as characteristics associated with worse survival and higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low platelets, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and mean corpuscular volume were independent factors associated only with worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 424 patients in whom the results of cytogenetic analyses were available, 164 (38.7%) showed karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was common but sole del(5q) was rare in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For predicting survival, most scoring systems were meaningful for stratifying patients into different subgroups, with the exception of the WPSS scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evolution, the Spanish scoring system was most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> showed different prognoses from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in prognoses between patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) from RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, this analysis indicated the presence of a different cytogenetic pattern as well as prognostic features in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
