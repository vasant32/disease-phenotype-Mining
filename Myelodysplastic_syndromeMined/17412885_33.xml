<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the function of Tregs is a key feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, whereas their expansion in malignant diseases leads to the suppression of host antitumor responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the absolute number of CD4+ and CD8(+) Tregs in the peripheral blood of 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and show a significant correlation between increased number of CD4+ Tregs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups with 5% or more bone marrow blasts (P &lt; .001), high International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score (P &lt; .001), and disease progression (P &lt; .001), whereas no correlation between CD8+ Tregs and prognostic variables was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD4+ Tregs showed a polyclonal spectratype, and the percentage of the naive subset was significantly higher in the high-risk patients compared with low-risk or healthy age-matched donors (P = .032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that CD4+ Treg expansion is a feature of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and progression to aggressive subtypes of the disease </plain></SENT>
