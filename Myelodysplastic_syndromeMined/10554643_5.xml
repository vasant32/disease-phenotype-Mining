<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ewing's tumor</z:e> patients has been improved gradually through cooperative therapy studies, so that meanwhile 55 to 65% of the patients survive relapse-free in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with multifocal primary, early or multiply-relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ewing's tumors</z:e> have a dismal prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Megatherapy with subsequent stem cell transplantation seems to improve outcome in this patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Feasibility of this intense megatherapy regimen is crucially dependent on collaboration and multidisciplinary coordination of radiologists, radiotherapists, surgeons and oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1988, 25 patients were treated with megatherapy consisting of melphalan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and total-body irradiation followed by stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received 6 courses of an induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before the fourth therapy block, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were bulky at initial diagnosis (&gt; 200 ml) were excised, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> which could still be detected after the third chemotherapy block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the fifth and sixth chemotherapy block, patients received local irradiation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infiltrated sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persisting immunosuppression after high-dose treatment may facilitate the incidence of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To improve proliferation and cytotoxic activity of early regenerating NK-cells, adoptive immunotherapy with systemic IL-2 therapy after megatherapy is part of the treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 25 patients treated with megatherapy, 10 patients are still alive with a follow-up time of 6 months to 9 years after megatherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The time up to engraftment was decreased from 15 +/- 6 days down to 9 +/- 2 days through the use of G-CSF and CD34+ selected stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the same time, erythrocyte and platelet replacement was shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Frequently occurring complications were mucositis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient died after developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> and multi-organ failure, another patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 4.5 years after megatherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, relapse is still the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The influence of IL-2 on event-free survival cannot valued because 21 of 25 patients were treated with adoptive immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The complex diagnostic and therapeutic strategy renders and EFS of 34% for a patient group with otherwise dismal prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To clarify the efficiency of megatherapy in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ewing's tumors</z:e>, a standardized treatment strategy is necessary to accumulate a sufficient number of patients for large cooperative studies in this subject </plain></SENT>
