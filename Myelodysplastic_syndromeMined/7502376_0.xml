<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparing 36 patients (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13 RA</z:chebi>/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 13 RAEB, 10 RAEB-t) with seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, significant differences in both the percentage of erythroid precursor cells and the fraction of these cells in the S or S-G2M-phase of the DNA cell cycle between the four groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since neither the percentage of erythroid precursor cells nor their fraction in S or S-G2M phase alone was found to characterize their proliferative activity, we calculated the proliferative fractions of the erythroid cells, i.e. the number of the erythroid precursor cells in S or S-G2M related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow cells in S or S-G2M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Applying these parameters, we found significantly increased proliferative fractions of erythroid precursor cells in the RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p-0.03 and 0.002 respectively), as well as a highly significant decrease with disease progression </plain></SENT>
