<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median number of nucleated cells in infused cord blood was 2.66 x 10(7)/kg (range 1.90 to 4.15 x 10(7)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in 16 of 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time to absolute neutrophil count &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/L was 21.5 days (range 17 to 32), and the median time to platelet count &gt;2.0 x 10(9)/L was 36 days (range 26 to 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 evaluable patients, five and eight had grades I and II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, respectively, and none had grades III/IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 44.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 7 of 15 evaluable patients: limited type in three patients, extensive type in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients, 14 were alive and disease-free between 173 and 1514 days after CBT (median 746 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of disease-free survival at 2 years was 79.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results, although in a retrospective study, suggested that tacrolimus and short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> effectively prevented the occurrence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD after unrelated CBT, and may contribute to a high survival rate </plain></SENT>
