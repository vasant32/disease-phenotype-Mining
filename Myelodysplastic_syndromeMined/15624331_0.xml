<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD34+ cells from 16 MDS patients were purified up to 96% approximately 99% by means of a immunomagnetic beads sorting system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of individual and combination of HGFs on the proliferation and differentiation of the CD34+ cells were studied in semi -solid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD34+ cells were impaired and none of the individual HGF (GM-CSF, IL-3, SCF) could effectively support their proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rh-SCF combined with GM-CSF, IL-3 or Epo could partly increase the colony forming capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hematopoietic progenitor, however, an increase of undifferentiated blast cells colonies occurred in some high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Proper combination of HGFs was essential for improving hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
