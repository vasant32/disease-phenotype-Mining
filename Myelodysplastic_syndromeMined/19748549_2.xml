<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of cellular senescence to the progression and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed the expression of p16INK4a in bone marrow mononuclear cells or CD34(+) cells from 53 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and 11 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, We have assessed quantitatively senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>) staining on bone marrow mononuclear cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, HL60 and SHI-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, and healthy control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An upregulated expression of senescence-associated molecular marker p16INK4a was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with healthy controls, while a lower expression of p16INK4a was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>International Prognostic Scoring System score was negatively correlated with the percentage of p16INK4a-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SA-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> activity measured by mean percentage of positive cells was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, percentage of SA-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>-positive cells was also remarkably higher in dysplastic cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when compared to nondysplastic cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results of our present study suggested an accelerated cellular senescence occurred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the cellular senescence may be involved in the progression and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
