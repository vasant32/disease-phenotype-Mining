<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To increase the credibility of retrospective exposure assessments. documentation of the procedures and presentation of measures on quality control is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to present and evaluate the procedures used in a case-control study on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 1,087 cases and matched controls were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure assessments were performed for 13 occupational agents and ten leisure-time activities and the confidence of the assessments was coded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exposure assessments were performed blind by three occupational hygienists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of the interviews were reassessed by two of the three occupational hygienists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The leisure-time activities contributed to a large extent to the overall prevalence of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For organic solvents approximately 25% of the controls classified as exposed would be misclassified if leisure-time exposure were not considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of subject assessments with low confidence were higher for next-of-kin than for in-person interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was seen between the proportions of assessments with low confidence and the reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was seen in the inter-rater comparison between cases and controls when the reliability was calculated for each assessed period; no difference was seen for the subject assessments used for relative risk estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When low-dose exposure in epidemiological studies are being assessed there is an obvious risk of misclassification if leisure-time activities are not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reliability of the assessments may suffer if next-of-kin interviews are used to a large extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with poor prognoses, prospective studies are preferable to minimise possible information bias </plain></SENT>
