<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With regard to the BM mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein expression ranged from 6.6 to 57.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-color flow cytometry revealed that among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>-MNCs the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein was clearly expressed on the CD14+, CD13+, and factor 8+ cells, whereas it was low on the CD19+ and CD7+ cells and did not express on the CD34+, CD8+, and the glycophorin A+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein expression was not seen on the PB CD11b+ and CD13+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IP results revealed that the 180-kD <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein was detected on the MNCs of both the BM and PB cells by the antibodies AF5, specific for the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> extracellular domain, and G97-449, specific for the cytoplasmic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, flow cytometry did not detect the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein on any BM-MNC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> lineages (0.1-1.5%) or on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> leukemic cells (0.1-0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IP results indicated that the AF5 antibody did not detect the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein on BM-MNCs of three of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and four of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients; however, the G97-449 antibody detected the 180-kD <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in whom AF5 had detected greatly reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein presence appears to be associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, and that its absence on the surfaces of the BM-MNCs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells may contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
