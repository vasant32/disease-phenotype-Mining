<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, deletions (loss of part of a chromosome) of the long arm of chromosome 20, del(20q), are commonly observed in hematologic malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using in situ chromosomal hybridization of a c-src probe to metaphase cells prepared from leukemic bone marrow cells of three patients with a del(20q), we observed specific labeling on the deleted chromosome in each patient, indicating that the c-src locus was conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence on the rearranged chromosomes of c-src, which is normally located on the most distal band of 20q, indicated that the deletions were not terminal as they appeared to be on the basis of chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but rather that they were interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location of c-src relative to the distal breakpoint in these deletions is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using the v-src probe in Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from three patients with a del(20q), we found that no major genomic rearrangements or amplification of the c-src genes had occurred within the regions homologous to v-src </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observation that c-src is consistently preserved in these rearranged chromosomes suggests that this gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of some myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
