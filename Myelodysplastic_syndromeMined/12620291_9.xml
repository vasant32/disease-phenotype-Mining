<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The category of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) has been abandoned in the new WHO-classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients previously belonging to this category are now classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the FAB-classification, patients had been assigned to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> category if they had either (1) a medullary blast count between 20 and 30% or (2) a peripheral blast count of at least 5%, or (3) Auer rods detectable, irrespective of the blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed these subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> in terms of hematological characteristics, karyotype anomalies, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 20% medullary blasts and patients with at least 5% peripheral blasts as the sole defining parameter for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> had a median survival of 6 months, as compared to 11 months in patients with Auer rods as the sole defining parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of Auer rods therefore does not convey a particularly bad prognosis and does not justify placing patients in a high-risk category of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or even classifying them as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the elimination of Auer rods as a parameter for classification in the new WHO system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the reclassification into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB II</z:e> (according to WHO proposals) of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients with a peripheral blast count of at least 5% is problematic, because this feature predicts a median survival not different from that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
