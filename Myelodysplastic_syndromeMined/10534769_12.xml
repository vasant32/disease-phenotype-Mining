<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spectral karyotyping (SKY) is a new molecular cytogenetic technique that allows simultaneous visualization of each chromosome in a different color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used SKY for comprehensive analysis of 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) (13 primary MDSs, 3 therapy-related MDSs, and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> developed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 1 cell line established from a secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), previously analyzed by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To locate the chromosomal breakpoints, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>-counterstained band images from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases were transformed to G-band-like patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using SKY, it was possible to identify the origin and organization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clonal marker chromosomes (mar), as well as the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormalities defined as additional material of unknown origin (add) or homogeneously staining regions (hsr) by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, SKY identified the chromosomal basis of 38 mar, add, and hsr, corrected 8 abnormalities misidentified by G-banding, and revealed 6 cryptic translocations in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total or partial chromosomal loss (mainly of -5/5q- and -7/7q-) is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 of 11 cases with -5/5q- and in 4 of 8 with -7/7q-, lost material was detected by SKY in unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 chromosomal losses were identified by G-banding in 16 cases with multiple chromosome abnormalities involving at least 3 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 26 of these losses (43%), SKY analysis suggested that the losses were not complete, but had been translocated to a variety of partner chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SKY analysis revealed that a ring chromosome in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> developed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> contained three to six segments that originated from chromosome 21 material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed the amplification of the AML1 gene on regions derived from chromosome 21, providing the first evidence of amplification involving this gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genes Chromosomes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> 26:336-345, 1999 </plain></SENT>
