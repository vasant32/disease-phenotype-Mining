<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed at evaluating ASXL1mut in 740 AML with intermediate risk karyotype for frequency, association with other mutations and impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five hundred fifty-three cases had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (NK) and 187 had intermediate risk aberrant cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, ASXL1mut were detected in 127/740 patients (17.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASXL1mut were more frequent in males than in females (23.5% vs 9.9%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were associated with higher age (median: 71.8 vs 61.8, P&lt;0.001), a history of preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and with a more immature immunophenotype compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ASXL1 (ASXL1wt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASXL1mut were more frequent in patients with aberrant karyotype (58/187; 31.0%), especially in cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (39/74; 52.7%), than in those with NK (69/553; 12.5%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ASXL1mut were observed more frequent in RUNX1mut (P&lt;0.001), and less frequent in NPM1mut (P&lt;0.001), FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (P&lt;0.001), FLT3-TKD (P=0.001) and DNMT3Amut (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ASXL1mut had a shorter overall survival (OS) (P&lt;0.001) and event free survival (P=0.012) compared with ASXL1wt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, ASXL1mut was an independent adverse factor for OS (P=0.032, relative risk: 1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ASXL1mut belong to the most frequent mutations in intermediate risk group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their strong and independent dismal prognostic impact suggests the inclusion into the diagnostic work-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
