<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefit has been shown, but the high cost of colony-stimulating factors has led to concern about their appropriate use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> has established evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines for the use of colony-stimulating factors in patients who are not enrolled in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An expert multidisciplinary panel reviewed the clinical data documenting the activity of colony-stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each common clinical situation, the panel formulated a guideline to encourage reasonable use of colony-stimulating factors to preserve effectiveness but discourage excess use when little marginal benefit is anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes considered in evaluating colony stimulating factor benefit included duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, incidence of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, incidence and duration of antibiotic use, frequency and duration of hospitalization, infectious mortality, chemotherapy dose intensity, chemotherapy efficacy, quality of life, colony-stimulating factor toxicity, and economic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the extent that these data were available, the panel placed greatest value on survival benefit, reduction in rates of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, decreased hospitalization, and reduced costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesser value was placed on alterations in absolute neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
