<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow smears were fixed with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi>-formalin buffer and immunostained with a monoclonal anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> conjugated anti-mouse IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the smears were re-fixed with <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> (4', 6-diamidino-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48559">phenylindole</z:chebi>) staining was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an automatic Digital-Microfluorometer (Olympus MMSP-FR-II), megakaryocytes on the smears were identifies by the GPIIb/IIIa immunofluorescence and, after changing the barrier filters, their nuclear DNA content was measured by the intensity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we found that the DNA histogram of the megakaryocytes from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> showed a shift to small ploidy compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method may be valuable in the measurement of the megakaryocyte DNA content </plain></SENT>
