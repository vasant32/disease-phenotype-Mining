<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that a multifunctional protein, YB-1, was expressed strongly in the spleen of a GATA-1 mutant mouse, which was filled with transformed erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggested that YB-1 has roles in erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined in vivo expression of YB-1 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in bone marrow erythroid cells and erythroid leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During erythroid differentiation of erythroid leukemic cell lines, the expression level of YB-1 mRNA was highest at the early phase of differentiation and then decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In human bone marrow cells, the in vivo expression level of YB-1 mRNA was higher in glycophorin A-positive cells than in glycophorin A-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interesting finding was that expression of YB-1 was higher in erythroblasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings suggested that YB-1 functions in the early stage of erythropoiesis and that aberrant expression of this protein may induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
