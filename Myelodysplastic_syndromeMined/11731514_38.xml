<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term outcome after allogeneic (allo) and autologous (auto) blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 157 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, who underwent BMT between March 1985 and April 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients &lt;or= age 55 with HLA-matched siblings were prioritized toward allo BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 28 years (range, 13 to 52 years) for the 53 allo patients and 30.5 years (range, 11 to 62 years) for the 104 auto patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up after BMT for surviving patients was 5.1 years (range, 1 to 13.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the entire group, the probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) and relapse at 10 years were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 33%) and 58% (95% CI, 48% to 69%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, disease status before BMT (sensitive relapse if responding to conventional-dose therapy or resistant disease if not) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39, P &lt; .0001) and date of BMT (HR = 0.93, P = .004) were independent predictors of EFS, whereas only disease status (HR = 0.35, P &lt; .0001) influenced relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for probability of relapse in sensitive patients to be less after allo BMT at 34% (range, 8% to 59%) versus 51% (range, 36% to 67%) for the auto patients (HR = 0.51, P = .17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a continuing risk of relapse or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) for 12 years after auto BMT, whereas there were no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or relapses beyond 3 years after allo BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There seems to be a clinical graft-versus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> effect associated with allo BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Allo BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> also seems to have a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than auto BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, allo BMT warrants continued study in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
