<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the clinical response to thalidomide in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (IM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is related to its ability to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> or its immunomodulatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of thalidomide on T-lymphocyte subsets in 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 6 patients with MM, 4 patients with IM, and 3 patients with angioimmunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AILD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had either a relapse or progressive disease following cytotoxic chemotherapy including high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide was first administered at 100 mg/day p.o. and increased to 400 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+) were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) before and during treatment with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 31 patients responded to thalidomide, most of them achieving partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median concentration of CD4+ cells was 443/microl, the median of CD8+ cells was 359/microl (CD3 992/microl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, no significant changes in absolute numbers or proportions of CD3+ (P = 0.12), CD4+ (P = 0.668), or CD8+ (P = 0.143) cells were observed following the treatment with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the CD4/CD8 ratio declined from 1.6 to 1.0 during 3 months of thalidomide treatment, this had no statistical significance (P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that an effect of thalidomide on the T lymphocytes studied is unlikely to be of major importance for the clinical effects </plain></SENT>
