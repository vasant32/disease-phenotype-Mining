<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients with this deletion were collected by the Workshop, 30 had terminal and 27 had interstitial deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 16 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>acute biphenotypic leukemia</z:hpo>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 12 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALL patients had a median age of 7 years, median white blood cell count (WBC) of 15 x 10(9)/l, and 10/24 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients had a median age of 23 years, a median WBC of 49 x 10(9)/l, and 9/16 had M4 or M5 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome depended on diagnosis: children with ALL had a better prognosis (4/16 relapsed, one died) than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adults and children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 5/12 MDS patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified 3 del(11q23) as translocations or insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies revealed a MLL rearrangement in 8/10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the involvement of MLL might be of prognostic relevance, identification of a del(11q23) should be an indication for FISH and molecular studies </plain></SENT>
