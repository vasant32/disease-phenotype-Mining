<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In adults the development of modern equipment for ambulatory monitoring permits long-term evaluation of the lower urinary tract which is more accurate than standard urodynamics (SUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children continuous urodynamic monitoring (CUM) has been used infrequently and therefore standardisation of the method has not been previously achieved, nor have the techniques and difficulties of performing 24-hour monitoring been solved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify a technical method of CUM in children which was feasible and to verify its usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we reviewed our preliminary experiences of CUM in children with <z:mp ids='MP_0005302'>neuropathic bladder</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From March to November 1995 we made an outpatient study of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005302'>neuropathic bladders</z:mp> of 11 myelodysplastic children aged 1 to 18 years (average age 10.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>7 of them were males and 4 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent SUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the children resting in bed, a 6-hour CUM (Lectromed MPR-2) was performed using a 4 Fr. microtip intravesical catheter (suprapubic in 3 infants and transurethral in 8 children) and an intrarectal catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parents and/or a nurse monitored the fluid intake and micturition events and recorded the data in a diary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the CUM experience in infants with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> dysfunction, the 3 suprapubic studies were done after 12 hours of urethral drainage in order to prevent leakage of urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients we were able to study 2 to 4 bladder fillings during a period of 6 to 8 hours (average 6.5 hours) observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 11 children the CUM pattern was comparable to the SUD one but in the 2 remaining patients CUM showed uninhibited contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher uninhibited voiding contraction pressures were recorded in hyper-reflexic bladders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results show that it is feasible to perform CUM in children and that it has advantages over standard cystometry in the investigation of children with <z:mp ids='MP_0005302'>neuropathic bladder</z:mp> even if it is carried out for short term (6 hours) </plain></SENT>
