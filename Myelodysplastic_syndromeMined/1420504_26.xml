<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously BID or supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central pathology review was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were classified according to the FAB criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall concordance rate for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype was 52%, and 25 patients were pathology exclusions, including 20 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to a single cycle of LDAC was 32%, with 11% complete and 21% partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 5.9 months, with a range of 1.4-33.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the time to progression or the overall survival for patients treated with LDAC or supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of leukemic transformation was similar in both arms at 15%, but it differed according to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving LDAC had a decreased transfusion requirement after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the degree of cytoreduction after receiving a single cycle of LDAC and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This survival difference was most marked in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
