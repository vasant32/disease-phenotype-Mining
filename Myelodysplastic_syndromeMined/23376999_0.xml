<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear how individual cells initially sense changes in phosphate availability and the cellular consequences of these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PiT1 (or SLC20A1) is a constitutively expressed, high-affinity <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent phosphate import protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro data suggest that PiT1 serves a direct role in mediating cellular proliferation; its role in vivo is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have discovered that mice lacking PiT1 develop a profound underproduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> characterized by mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>, dyserythropoiesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp>, and a near complete block in terminal erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the animals are severely B cell lymphopenic because of a defect in pro-B cell development and mildly neutropenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phenotype is intrinsic to the hematopoietic system, is associated with a defect in cell cycle progression, and occurs in the absence of changes in serum phosphate or calcium concentrations and independently of a change in cellular phosphate uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and block in terminal erythroid differentiation and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> are striking and suggest that PiT1 serves a fundamental and nonredundant role in murine terminal erythroid differentiation and B cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> mimics the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> in some low-grade human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, this murine model might also provide pathologic insight into these disorders </plain></SENT>
