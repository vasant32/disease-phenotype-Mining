<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its clinical efficacy as well as its biologic safety, human recombinant Erythropoietin (rh-Epo) was given to 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in an open non-randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the seventeen evaluable patients only two showed an apparent hematologic response to rh-Epo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels increased from a mean pretreatment value of 8.5 and 8.4 g/dl up to 11.7 and 11.3 g/dl respectively and remained relatively stable for several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients the transfusion requirement decreased from 4 to 1.5 units per month whereas the other had no transfusion requirement during the whole period of rh-Epo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when the responding patients, after a "wash-out" period of at least ten weeks, received an additional course of rh-Epo results were less impressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment the serum level of endogenous Epo was 18 and 110 mU/ml in the two responding patients, whereas a mean value of 532 mU/ml (range 17-2797 mU/ml) was observed in non responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with rh-Epo was clinically well tolerated since no relevant side effects were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no evidence of harmful cytogenetic changes nor activation of myeloid growth factor genes, as determined by Northern blot analysis of GM-CSF and G-CSF gene expression, could be related to rh-Epo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, it appears that administration of rh-Epo is well tolerated but the therapeutic effects appear to be restricted to a minority of patients and a limited period of time </plain></SENT>
