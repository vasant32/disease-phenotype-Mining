<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells in patients with BM failure are derived from single PIGA mutant haematopoietic stem cells even when their percentages are &lt;1% and their fate depends on the proliferation and self-maintenance properties of the individual PIGA mutants </plain></SENT>
