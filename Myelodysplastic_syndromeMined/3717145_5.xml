<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A marker for immaturity, defined by the presence of the antigen recognized by the My9 antibody, was found to persist on the surface of mature neutrophils in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal My9 positivity was concentrated primarily, but not exclusively, in previously described morphologically defined subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients considered to be at highest risk for leukemic conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal study of a larger number of patients will be required to test the hypothesis that abnormal persistence of My9 may have prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
