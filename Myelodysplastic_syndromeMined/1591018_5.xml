<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were able to observe growth inhibitory activity on porcine endothelial cells only after acidification of the materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibitory activity is neutralized by anti-TGF-beta antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It indicates that TGF-beta exists as a latent form in the conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of growth inhibition assay, the mean level of TGF-beta production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was estimated to be 188 +/- 199 pg/1 x 10(7) cells and that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers was 668 +/- 314 pg/1 x 10(7) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the lymphocytes of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the AA patients failed to produce detectable amounts of TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between TGF-beta levels and peripheral blood parameters could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin is known to increase the production of TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of TGF-beta production was also observed in AA (45% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible roles of the decreased production of TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of AA were discussed </plain></SENT>
