<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 5q also occur in the full spectrum of other de novo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) types, most often in association with other chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the loss of genetic material from 5q is believed to be of primary importance in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> del(5q) disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using a chromosome 5-specific whole chromosome painting probe and a 5q subtelomeric probe to determine the incidence of cryptic translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied archival fixed chromosome suspensions from 36 patients with myeloid disorders (predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and del(5q) as the sole abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 AML patients studied, this identified a translocation of 5q subtelomeric sequences from the del(5q) to the short arm of an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH with chromosome 11-specific subtelomeric probes confirmed the presence of 11p on the shortened 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further FISH mapping confirmed that the 5q and 11p translocation breakpoints were the same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases, between the nucleophosmin (NPM1) and fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) genes on 5q35 and the Harvey ras-1-related gene complex (HRC) and the radixin pseudogene (RDPX1) on 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients with the cryptic t(5;11) were children: a total of 3 of 4 AML children studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M2 and the third was classified as M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 responded poorly to treatment and had short survival times, ranging from 10 to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although del(5q) is rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e>, this study indicates that, within this subgroup, the incidence of cryptic t(5;11) may be high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is significant that none of the 24 MDS patients studied, including 11 confirmed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, had the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this appears to be a new nonrandom chromosomal translocation, specifically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e> with a differentiated blast <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and the presence of a del(5q) </plain></SENT>
