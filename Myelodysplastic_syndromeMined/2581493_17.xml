<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in 77 patients terminating in "overt" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> revealed sequential changes of marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with respect to cellularity and involvement of lineages, indicating that different "forms" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> represent in reality different phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three main phases were observed, which occurred in the following non-reversible sequence: (a) hypocellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (H), (b) hypercellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with predominance of erythropoiesis (E), and (c) with predominance of myelo(mono)poiesis (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Published studies suggest that these phases represent different manifestation stages of the stem cell lesion leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Manifestation may probably be promoted by factors causing marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transition to "overt" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in several cases occurred locally, not throughout the whole marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some patients a mature myelo(mono)-cytic cell population showed the capacity for widespread tissue infiltration, characteristic of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This argues against the theory that "overt" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is the result of continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but favours the concept of multiple initiating "events" leading to evolution of a leukemic subclone within a myelodysplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A connection between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase, from which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed, was also observed indicating that the risk of different stem cell subpopulations to become the target of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> initiating "event" varies during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
