<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 22 patients with hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> which included: 12 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytochemistry criteria established by FAB (French, American and British Committee), a Myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo>) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemia</z:hpo> where we established the relationship between the traditional peroxidase reaction with the anti-MPO by APAAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also carried out the nonspecific esterase reaction and determined the immunologic phenotype by FACS technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same procedure was used for the cellular analysis of the light chains kappa (kappa) and lambda (lambda) in 3 cases of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 cases of plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and reactive plasma cell disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunocytochemical reactions must be used when <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and traditional cytochemical reactions need to be confirmed in order to establish a correct diagnosis and this is specially important for B and T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their prognostic value is restricted and the results are useful as a complement to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytochemistry and immunological determinations </plain></SENT>
