<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Investigation of X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP) by determination of differential CpG-methylation has been widely applied for investigation of female cell clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this approach the clonal origin of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> has been corroborated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controversially, strong age-related increase of peripheral blood (PB) cell clonality in haematologically healthy female subjects was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, transcriptional XCIP ratio analysis challenged these results and questioned the suitability of methylation based clonality assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To reinvestigate XCIP-skewing in CD34, low-density mononuclear bone marrow (BM) as well as PB cells from healthy female subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we established a transcriptional assay using pyrosequencing technique for quantification of single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies, representative for XCIP ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our assay provides high sensitivity for XCIP ratio assessment as determined by standard curves, reproducibility, inter-marker correlation as well as correlation with the DNA-methylation based human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (HUMARA) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, in agreement with most studies investigating this issue, significant age-related increase of XCIP skewing in PB cells from healthy elderly female subjects was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, XCIP ratio analysis suggests even stronger clonal manifestation in BM and CD34 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, XCIP skewing levels were distinctively elevated as compared with controls of similar age and higher degrees were associated with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional clonal profiling via pyrosequencing allows accurate assessment of XCIP ratios, confirms the validity of the DNA-methylation based HUMARA assay and reveals important insights into ageing healthy and myelodysplastic haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
