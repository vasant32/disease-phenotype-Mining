<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To standardize a rational therapeutic strategy of chemotherapy using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), we retrospectively analyzed 292 high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients in 20 hospitals in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of multivariate analysis of the data on patients who received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of chemotherapy indicated that poor cytogenetics as shown by the IPSS was the only significant risk factor (P = .047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then focused on the IPSS composition of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intermediate 2 (Int-2) category consisted of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempted to subdivide the category into Int-2A and Int-2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with good or intermediate cytogenetics had &gt; or = 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts (Int-2A), and most of the other patients had poor cytogenetics and &lt; or = 10% BM blasts (Int-2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Int-2B category, overall survival for patients who received chemotherapy was significantly worse than for those who did not receive chemotherapy (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients in the High category who had the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to the World Health Organization classification had poor overall survival with or without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose the Int-2B and High categories may be considered possible high risk, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the Int-2A category and patients with more than 5% BM blasts in the Int-1 category may be categorized as being at possible intermediate risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our proposition may be useful for developing a chemotherapeutic strategy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
