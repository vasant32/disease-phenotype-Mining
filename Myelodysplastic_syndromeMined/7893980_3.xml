<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trephine biopsies were studied from 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948968" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteomyelofibrosis</z:e> (PMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated anti-EBV EA titers were found in 62% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, in 33% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CMLs</z:mp> and in 62% of the OMF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HHV-6 titers were elevated in 18% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, but in only one case each of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and OMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigen expression in bone marrow cells was even more frequent: EBV-EA was 76% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, 77% in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 40% in OMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HHV-6 p41 was observed in 47% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, in 54% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases and in 20% of the OMFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparing these data with those from the literature and with our own studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, it is hypothesized that the reactivated herpesviruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of these hematopoietic disorders by interfering with the cytokine regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
