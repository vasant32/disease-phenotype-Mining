<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To exploit the role of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in cytogenetic evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The metaphase cytogenetics and BM interphase FISH were prospectively compared in 112 cases of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, comparison of BM and PB FISH was conducted in 56 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The differences between metaphase cytogenetics and BM FISH were observed in 22 (54%) of 41 cases with clonal karyotypic abnormalities, most of differences were caused by the limitation of FISH probe panel which could not target <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the regions with aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 6 (27%) of 22 differences were involved in our probe regions, the FISH results did not change their cytogenetic risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BM FISH testing was abnormal in 15 (21%) of 71 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, FISH testing was abnormal in 14/51 (27%) and 1/20 (5%) cases with fewer than 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases or more than 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of FISH results of PB and BM samples showed abnormal PB FISH results in 21 (72%) of 29 cases with abnormal BM FISH results, and in 1 (4%) of 27 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BM FISH should be used to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with fewer than 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although PB FISH testing is limited by a relatively high false negative rate, it is a reasonable choice to cases with failure of BM <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
