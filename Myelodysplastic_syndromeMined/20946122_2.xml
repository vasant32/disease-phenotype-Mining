<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BMNCs depleted of CD4(+) /CCR5(+) T cells exhibited significantly increased numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the bone marrow mononuclear cells cultures with a fourfold augmentation of CD4(+) /CCR5(+) T lymphocytes exhibited no colonies in cultures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic index (AI) of colony cells was decreased compared with that of preculture counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD4(+) /CCR5(+) in vitro cultures, the clonal cells increased in patients with chromosome 5q- or 20q- abnormalities but remained unchanged in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, after removal of CD4(+) /CCR5(+) T cells, the number of CFUs was increased in those patients with a higher number of BM Th1 (CD4(+) / IFN-Î³(+) ) cells, hypocellularity, or bearing the DR15 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the selective removal of autologous activated CD4(+) T cells can increase the generation of CFUs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, whether the increased CFUs consisted of cells derived from residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoiesis or clonal hemopoiesis remains unknown </plain></SENT>
