<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular function of p15Ink4b in hematopoietic differentiation still remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that loss of p15Ink4b in mice results in skewing of the differentiation pattern of the common myeloid progenitor towards the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated a function of p15Ink4b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in driving erythroid lineage commitment in hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that p15Ink4b is expressed more highly in committed megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors than granulocyte-macrophage progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More importantly, mice lacking p15Ink4b have lower numbers of primitive red cell progenitors and a severely impaired response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27924">phenylhydrazine</z:chebi>-induced hematopoietic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Introduction of p15Ink4b into multipotential progenitors produced changes at the molecular level, including activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase\extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling, increase GATA-1, erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and decrease Pu1, GATA-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes rendered cells more permissive to erythroid commitment and less permissive to myeloid commitment, as demonstrated by an increase in early burst-forming unit-erythroid formation with concomitant decrease in myeloid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that p15Ink4b functions in hematopoiesis, by maintaining proper lineage commitment of progenitors and assisting in rapid red blood cells replenishment following stress </plain></SENT>
