<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, and despite its great incidence, its biologic significance remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some reports have shown the existence of masked <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To try to detect occult <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, we performed a study in which 34 myeloid disorders with apparent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes using conventional cytogenetic techniques were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Masked <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was not detected in any of the 34 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 may be a rare event in myeloid disorders in which an optimal conventional cytogenetic analysis has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 either in early neoplastic stages in some cases or in late neoplastic stages in others and the absence of masked <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 suggest that this chromosome alteration may not be essential to the development of myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
