<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement in 3q26 has been reported to occur near the Evi-1 locus, implicating that it is the critical gene deregulated in the 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present a structural abnormality of Evi-1 protein in a case with the 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case carrying typical inv(3)(q21q26), the 3q26 breakpoint is located within an intron of the Evi-1 gene, and resulted in overexpression of normally unexpressed, an aberrant form of Evi-1 protein, in which the C-terminal 44 amino acids of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Evi-1 protein were truncated and replaced by five amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The truncated Evi-1 protein is shown to increase AP1 activity when expressed in NIH3T3 cells as its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that the origin of this peculiar type of rearrangement of the Evi-1 gene is not an artifact during establishment of the cell line, but is the event that occurred in the primary leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly support that the primary target for the 3q21q26 syndrome is the Evi-1 gene, and provide the first evidence that the structurally altered Evi-1 gene may be involved in the 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
