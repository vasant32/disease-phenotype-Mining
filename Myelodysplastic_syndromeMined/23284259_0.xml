<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a multicentric prospective study carried out from October 2009 to March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 500 over 19-year-old patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data such as type of healthcare insurance, gender, age, ethnic classification, place of residence, schooling, income, body mass index, new cases and the period between the first symptoms and a definite diagnosis were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and incidence rates were calculated according to an estimated number of 1,319,800 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence and incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants in the period of six months were, respectively: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> 1.5 and 0.7; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> 0.5 and 0.1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> 2.4 and 0.4; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 6.2 and 0.8; Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2.9 and 0.9; non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 9.8 and 4.3; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 5.7 and 0.7; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> 2.1 and 0.2 and myeloproliferative syndromes 5.1 and 0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Giving the paucity of data in this field of investigation, our data may be useful for comparisons with those of other regions of Brazil and will assist in the implementation of treatment programs of oncohematological diseases in this region </plain></SENT>
