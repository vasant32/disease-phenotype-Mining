<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The status of underlying disease at the time of transplantation was prognostic for the 2-year disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients received intensive chemotherapy prior to the conditioning for BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2-year disease-free survival was 60% for the 16 patients transplanted in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were significantly less favourable for those with more advanced disease who only partially responded to prior intensive chemotherapy (2-year disease-free survival: 18%) while none of those who either relapsed or were resistant to chemotherapy survived BMT for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients had not received any prior intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival at 2 years after BMT was 58 +/- 19% when a patient was transplanted for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA(S], 74 +/- 14% for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 50 +/- 16% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt), and 18 +/- 11% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BMT can therefore be considered as curative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with sAML who have a histocompatible donor should be given chemotherapy intensive enough to induce complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If this is achieved these individuals have a prognosis comparable to those with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission after BMT </plain></SENT>
