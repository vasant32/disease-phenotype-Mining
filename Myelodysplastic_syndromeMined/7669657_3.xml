<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a group of elderly patients was analysed for four molecular and cell biological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to screen elderly patients with idiopathic macrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for a set of alterations which are related to haematological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyses used were: DNA-methylation at the calcitonin A gene 5'-area, NRAS point mutations at codons 12 and 13, in vitro colony formation of peripheral blood progenitor cells and cytogenetics of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that a significant portion of elderly patients with idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> have one or more of the abnormalities analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the calcitonin A gene 5'-area at the chromosome 11 band p15 is relatively common (7/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations (3/12) and NRAS oncogene point mutations (0/15) were rare findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro culture of erythroid progenitor cells was relatively frequently abnormal (7/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of our nine macrocytic patients who did not fulfill the FAB criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had at least one of the alterations studied; this suggests that these patients might represent early phases of a stem cell disorder </plain></SENT>
