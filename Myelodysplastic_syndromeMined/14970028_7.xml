<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transplantation conditioning regimens have been shown to affect the brain imaging appearance in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the occurrence of neurotoxicity was affected by the choice of conditioning regimen used before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An allo-BMT was performed in 290 patients conditioned before transplantation with myeloablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 developed in 21 (7.2%) of these patients, as confirmed with CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred seventy-four (94%) of these 290 patients were conditioned with minor variations of one of five fundamental regimens: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (n = 97), Cy/total body irradiation (TBI) (n = 122), Cy/thiotepa/TBI (n = 40), bischloroethylnitrosourea/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/melphalan, or BEAM (n = 10), and Cy/thiotepa/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 patients were prepared with variable regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 neurotoxicity relative to these conditioning regimens were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lowest rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 neurotoxicity was found in those patients conditioned with Cy (2 days)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (4 days) (5.1%) or Cy (2 days)/TBI (4 days) (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rate of neurotoxicity increased with lengthier conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high rate of neurotoxicity was present in those patients conditioned with Cy (4 days)/TBI (4 days) (13.7%), and this was statistically significant (P &lt;.05) when compared with Cy (2 days)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 neurotoxicity varies with the conditioning regimen used, with lengthier regimens associated with a higher rate of neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the length of the conditioning regimen equates to the total dose of chemotherapy administered, it suggests that the intensity of the regimen is correlated to the predisposition to neurotoxicity from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or FK-506 </plain></SENT>
