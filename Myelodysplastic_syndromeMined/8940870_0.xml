<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no blasts in the peripheral blood, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, associated with marked <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow was hyperplastic and there was a slight decrease in megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The myelogram showed 5.6% blasts + promyelocytes, and there was no basophilia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of third-line cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis yielded 47, XY, +8, t (9;22) (q34;q11), and the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed a large ber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) were fulfilled and the Ph1 chromosome was detected, a diagnosis of Ph1-positive CMMoL was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">Hydroxyurea</z:chebi> was given for cytoreduction and the patient has been followed with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation for about one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CMMoL is classified as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is rare to find the Ph1 chromosome in patients with these syndromes, and there have been very few reports of its detection in CMMoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CMMoL may not be a single disease entity, and it may be useful to investigate more cases like the present one, to reassess this disease </plain></SENT>
