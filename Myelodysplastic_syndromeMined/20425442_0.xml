<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The French-American-British classification, based primarily on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, was modified by the World Health Organization system to include the negative impact of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and higher blast counts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System was created to calculate prognosis, risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, and median survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, therapeutic decisions cannot be solely guided by these systems, and the clinician must decide whether the intent is curative or palliative </plain></SENT>
