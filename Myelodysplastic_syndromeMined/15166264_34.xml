<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Approximately 19500 routine bone marrow biopsies were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining with antibodies against tryptase, KIT, and CD25 and molecular analysis for detection of C-KIT point mutations were performed in approximately 550/4100 myelogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SM was rare-it was diagnosed in only 64 bone marrows (0.3%) and made up 1.5% of myelogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301365" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SM-AHNMD</z:e> was the second most frequent subtype (20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301365" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SM-AHNMD</z:e> was never included in the clinical differential diagnoses and was confirmed histologically in most cases only after appropriate immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal mast <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> was confirmed by immunohistochemical demonstration of tryptase and CD25 coexpression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301365" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SM-AHNMD</z:e> can be diagnosed histologically in bone marrow trephines only after immunostaining with antibodies against tryptase, KIT, and CD25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 20 AHNMDs were of myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>C-KIT point mutations were present in 16 of 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognostic relevance of detecting SM associated with another haematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> remains unclear, but mast cell resistance to most cytoreductive agents is of major importance for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
