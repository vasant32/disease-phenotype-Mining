<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mortality in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is mostly determined by relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was recently shown by us that patients who develop increasing quantities of autologous hematopoietic cells in peripheral blood (increasing mixed chimerism, in-MC) after allo-SCT do significantly more often relapse (P &lt; 0.0001) than patients with a complete chimerism (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a small series of patients with in-MC, the relapse rate could be significantly reduced by administration of donor lymphocytes (DLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: A prospective multicenter study was initiated under the question whether number of relapses can be significantly reduced either by withdrawal of post-transplant immunosuppression and/or by DLI in the critical stage of in-MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highly repetitive determination of the genetic status of 114 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (ALL: n = 41, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: n = 39, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: n = 34) revealed 55 cases with CC and 43 with in-MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) more often in patients with in-MC (25/43) than in patients with CC (12/55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-MC-patients showed a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) enhanced event free survival rate (11/24) when DLI was given and/or post-transplant immunosuppression was stopped compared to patients which did not receive such an interventional regimen (1/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two in-MC-patients developed fatal GVHD after immunological intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data substantiate that prophylactic immunotherapy on the basis of in-MC is a powerful treatment approach to suppress relapses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
