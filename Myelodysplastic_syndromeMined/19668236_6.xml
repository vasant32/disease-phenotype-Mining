<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical significance of pre-transplant International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score and comorbidity in 68 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n=48) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=20) between December 1995 and January 2008 in a single institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 41.0 months (range, 3.2-132.0 months), 27 patients died, and 7 relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 60.0 and 57.4%, respectively, and the 5-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (CINRM) and relapse were 32.7 and 9.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OS, EFS, and CINRM were significantly different according to pre-transplant IPSS score and presence of pre-transplant comorbidity, which were independent risk factors along with Karnofsky performance score in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pre-transplant IPSS score and comorbidity may stratify the risk of post transplant outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
