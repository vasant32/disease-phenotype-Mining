<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the outcomes of the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who had received cord blood that was mismatched for one HLA antigen (34 patients) or two antigens (116 patients), bone marrow that had one HLA mismatch (83 patients), and HLA-matched bone marrow (367 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional-hazards models to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cord-blood recipients were younger and more likely to have advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than were bone marrow recipients, and they received lower doses of nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic recovery was slower with transplantation of mismatched bone marrow and cord blood than with matched marrow transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was more likely to occur after mismatched marrow transplantation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was more likely to occur after cord-blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of treatment-related mortality, treatment failure, and overall mortality were lowest among patients who received matched marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who received mismatched bone marrow transplants and those who received mismatched cord-blood transplants had similar rates of treatment-related mortality (P=0.96), treatment failure (P=0.69), and overall mortality (P=0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the rate of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in outcome after cord-blood transplantation between patients with one HLA mismatch and those with two HLA mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HLA-mismatched cord blood should be considered an acceptable source of hematopoietic stem-cell grafts for adults in the absence of an HLA-matched adult donor </plain></SENT>
