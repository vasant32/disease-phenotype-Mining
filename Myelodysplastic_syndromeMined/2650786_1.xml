<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six evaluable patients transplanted with lymphocyte-depleted marrow for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time for platelet recovery to greater than or equal to 20 and to greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/l was 21 (9-72) and 26 (11-86) days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neutrophil recovery to greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and the leucocyte recovery to greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10(9)/l was 19 (8-47) and 18 (6-47) days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between the number of infused granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, erythroid burst-forming cells, diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, antibiotic administration and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of a continuous 6-day infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> to the conditioning regimen delayed the median recovery of platelets, neutrophils and leucocytes by 7-9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> also inhibited haematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that leakage of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> after bone marrow infusion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> secondary to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oromucositis</z:e> is responsible for the delayed bone marrow recovery </plain></SENT>
