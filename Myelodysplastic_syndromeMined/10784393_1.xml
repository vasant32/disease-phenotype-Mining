<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of the degree of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on survival has not been fully assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis of 111 patients selected according to the IPSS criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis, the presence or absence of 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> characteristics recognizable in bone marrow smears stained by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa method was correlated with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, megaloblastosis (MEGALO), neutrophil agranularity (AGRAN) and hypogranularity (HYPOGRAN) were highly significant predictors (p &lt; 0.005), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pelger-Huët anomaly</z:e> (PELGHUET) a significant predictor (p = 0.05), of patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regression analysis yielded a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-based risk index (DI) where DI = 1.26 MEGALO + 0.82 AGRAN - 1.08 HYPOGRAN + 0.45 PELGHUET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two subgroups of 60 and 47 patients with DI &lt; or = 0 and &gt; 0 showed highly significant differences in median survivals (2.6 vs 1.1 yrs; p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis further showed that DI offered additional predictive power that was independent of that provided by the IPSS (p=0.002 and 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of survival curves stratified for IPSS and DI showed that the additional predictive power offered by inclusion of the DI essentially concerned the IPSS low/INT-1 risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further stratification for age did not improve survival prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that a set of 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> parameters can offer some prediction for survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in addition to that provided by the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further multicenter studies should aim at including some form of evaluation of the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in prognostic systems </plain></SENT>
