<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A consensus-defined International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for predicting outcome and planning therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has been developed, but its prognostic value in a large and independent series remains unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intermediate-risk cytogenetic subgroup defined by the IPSS includes a miscellaneous number of different single abnormalities of uncertain prognostic significance at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main aim of the present study was to identify chromosomal abnormalities with a previously unrecognized good or poor prognosis in order to find new cytogenetic markers with predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the cytogenetic findings in a series of 968 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from the Spanish Cytogenetics Working Group, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="24433">Grupo</z:chebi> Cooperativo Español de Citogenética Hematológica (GCECGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this series of 968 MDS patients, we found various cytogenetic aberrations with a new prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotype, -7/7q- and i(17q) had a poor prognosis; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, loss of Y chromosome, deletion 11q, deletion 12p and deletion 20q as single alterations had a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intermediate prognosis aberrations were rearrangements of 3q21q26, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 9, translocations of 11q and del(17p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, a new group of single or double cytogenetic abnormalities, most of which are considered rare cytogenetic events and are usually included in the intermediate category of the IPSS, showed a trend to poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that some specific chromosomal abnormalities could be segregated from the IPSS intermediate-risk cytogenetic prognostic subgroup and included in the low risk or in the poor risk groups </plain></SENT>
