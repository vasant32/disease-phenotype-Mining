<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (EPO) is currently used in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, where it successfully corrects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 50-70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are refractory to this treatment and little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EPO in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the role of inositide pathways in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with EPO, mainly focusing on the Akt/PI-PLC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">Phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-Phospholipase C) gamma1 axis, which is activated by the EPO receptor, and PI-PLCbeta1/Cyclin D3 signaling, as Cyclin D3 is associated with hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, EPO responder patients showed a specific activation of both the Akt/PI-PLCgamma1 pathway and beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">Globin</z:chebi> gene expression, while nonresponders displayed an increase in PI-PLCbeta1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells induced to erythroid differentiation, PI-PLCbeta1 overexpression abrogated both EPO-induced Akt phosphorylation and beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">Globin</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, these findings suggest that PI-PLCbeta1 can act as a negative regulator of erythroid differentiation and confirm the involvement of Akt/PI-PLCgamma1 pathway in EPO signaling, therefore contributing to the comprehension of the effect of EPO in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and possibly paving the way to the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at higher risk of refractoriness to EPO treatment </plain></SENT>
