<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been used to treat patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but fewer than 50% respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to evaluate the benefit of rHuEpo +/- G-CSF treatment and to isolate the response predictive variables in a group of selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A non-randomized multicenter trial was carried out in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were age &gt;= 18 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, Hb &lt;= 100 g/L or receiving transfusions and serum erythropoietin &lt;= 250 U/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated with subcutaneous rHuEpo (300 U/kg) three times a week for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of partial response (PR) or no response (NR) subcutaneosly administered G-CSF (1 microg/kg) three times a week was added to the rHuEpo for 8 more weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the patient achieved complete response (CR) or PR in the second phase, he was included in a follow-up phase of 24 weeks in which the dose of growth factors was tapered down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several variables, including the score published by the Scandinavian-American group, were used as possible predictive variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An erythroid response was observed in 16 patients (50%); in 12 it was a CR and in 4 it was a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the period of rHuEpo administration, 7 CR and 4 PR (34.4%) were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients in whom G-CSF was added to rHuEpo, 7 (50%) responded (3 CR and 4 PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No major side-effects associated with growth factors were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that of the different variables evaluated only the Scandinavian-American response score was significant with a relative probability of response of 11.8 (95% confident intervals: 2.5-53) when this score was &gt; +1 (77% of cases responded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when this score was &lt;= 1 only 15 % of the cases responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Scandinavian-American response score is to be recommended in a patient-oriented approach to treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with the Epo and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rHuEpo and G-CSF is safe, its main drawback being its cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, a long-term study evaluating the regimen's cost-benefit ratio is warranted </plain></SENT>
