<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been a marked increase in the number of incidences of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has become a distinctive disease because of its etiology and genetic <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of tAML resulting from the use of cytotoxic agents can be divided into two groups based on the drugs administered to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first group includes the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and the second group includes agents that bind to the enzyme DNA-topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the unfavorable outcome of the disease and the need for prompt intensive treatment, a timely accurate diagnosis of tAML is critical to patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic study can detect abnormalities most commonly associated with tAML and thus providing important diagnostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, utilizing cytogenetic analysis alone cannot guarantee prompt and accurate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, an interesting case with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (tMDS/tAML) will be presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A laboratory diagnostic strategy for tAML laboratory diagnosis will also be proposed </plain></SENT>
