<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, compliance with these regimen is difficult to obtain in most cases because long-term administration is burdensome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, one each with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia intermedia</z:e>, self-administered subcutaneous one-shot administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> at a dose of 500 mg once or twice daily was carried out over a long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients serum ferritin level decreased significantly and the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> was prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver density on computed tomography scan also decreased in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This regimen, in which the patient self-administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> subcutaneously one or twice a day is seems to be the most practical method to protect against the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
