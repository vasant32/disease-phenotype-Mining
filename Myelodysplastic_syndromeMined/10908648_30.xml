<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated the human GRAF gene (for GTPase regulator associated with the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase pp125(FAK)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with deletions of 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q) </plain></SENT>
