<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although cytokines are critical for coordinating immune responses and immune reconstitution after BMT, there are still gaps in our knowledge about the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we systematically studied cytokine gene expression by PBMC from 11 allogeneic and four autologous BMT recipients from 111 to 837 days after BMT and compared the results with PBMC from seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls tested in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBMC were examined for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for IL-2r alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-7 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBMC from 11 allogeneic recipients constitutively expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IL-2r alpha in 2 of 11 and IL-2 in 1 of 9 samples tested whereas the same PBMC constitutively expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IL-3 in 8 of 11, IL-4 in 3 of 7, IL-6 in 6 of 7 and IL-7 in 3 of 6 samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After PHA/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> stimulation, PBMC from the same recipients frequently expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IL-2r alpha in 9 of 11, IL-2 in 8 of 9, IL-4 in 3 of 7 and IL-6 in 7 of 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PBMC from four autologous recipients (two short-term and two long-term) frequently constitutively expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IL-2r alpha (3 of 4) IL-2 (3 of 4), and IL-3 (4 of 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of PBMC from the autologous recipients did not alter cytokine expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
