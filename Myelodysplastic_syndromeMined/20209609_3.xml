<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little information exists regarding the prevalence and natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial disease</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors is associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusions</z:hpo> (PEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the characteristics and treatment relationships of PEs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the authors retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evaluated at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed 2592 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, n = 1282, 49%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, n = 336, 13%), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, n = 974, 38%), who were evaluated from August 2003 to July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electronic medical records were reviewed to select patients who had undergone at least 1 echocardiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data regarding diagnosis, timing, effusion size, survival, and prior therapy were collected for the patients who had echocardiographic evidence of PEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PEs were detected in 325 (20%) of the patients who had echocardiograms: 21% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 23% in ALL, and 18% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a small portion of PEs were detected before the initiation of therapy: 26% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 25% ALL, and 15% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most PEs were of minimal size (70%) overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in effusion characteristics, including severity, were observed among different types of therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of PEs had no impact on the survival of the patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PEs are relatively common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and do not appear to be related to specific types of therapy or to survival </plain></SENT>
