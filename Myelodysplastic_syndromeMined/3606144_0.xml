<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transforming gene was present in 12 out of 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Alu sequence was demonstrated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grown after injection of transfected NIH 3T3 cells from 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these 10 Alu sequences, the human N-ras oncogene was present in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of nucleotide sequences of the exons of human N-ras oncogenes cloned from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> revealed a single point mutation of the codon encoding the 13th amino acid of exon 1 from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-year follow-up study of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases showed that in the patients positive for the transforming gene, the disease state progressed from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="28618">PARA</z:chebi>, PASA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in 6 out of 7 cases, while in the 6 negative patients, no change was observed in their <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was considered that the mutation of the N-ras gene at the 13th amino acid codon of exon 1 was fairly specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that presence of the transforming gene may be used for predicting the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
