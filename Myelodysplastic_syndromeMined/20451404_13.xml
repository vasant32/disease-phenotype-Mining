<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to AZA (75 mg/m(2)/daysubcutaneously × 7 days every 28 days) (n=38) or CCR (n=49) and had median ages of 78 and 77 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AZA significantly improved OS vs CCR (HR: 0.48 [95%CI: 0.26, 0.89]; p=0.0193) and 2-year OS rates were 55% vs 15% (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AZA was generally well tolerated compared with CCR, which was primarily best supportive care (67%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given this efficacy and tolerability, AZA should be considered the treatment of choice in patients aged ≥ 75 years with good performance status and higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
