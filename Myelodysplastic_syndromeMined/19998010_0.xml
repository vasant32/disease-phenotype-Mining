<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to explore indications for and results of bone marrow examinations in a large cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 2004 146 bone marrow examinations in 3638 patients were performed due to abnormal laboratory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history, results of bone marrow examination (<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, histology) and cytogenetic data were investigated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' (67.8% female) mean age at bone marrow examination was 53.5 years (SD 15.5), median disease duration 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for bone marrow examination were changes in peripheral blood counts in 81.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 52 patients (35.6%) clinically relevant, partially neoplastic bone marrow changes (5 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 3 myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>) were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medication history showed intake of hydroxy-/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> (13.5%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (17.3%), cyclosporin (7.7%), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> (7.7%), mycophenolatmofetil, gold, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> (each 1.9%), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (aza, 25.0%) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (cyc, 7.7%) prior to bone marrow examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>7 out of 9 patients, who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had been treated with either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> alone or additionally with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: One third of our patients showed relevant bone marrow changes that might be associated to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk seems to be increased especially in patients with inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> who had received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Health care providers should bear in mind the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and monitor patients closely in this respect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination should be performed in case of changes in peripheral blood counts; especially clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, granulocytes &lt; 2,500/microl, thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/microl and relevant changes over time should lead to bone marrow examinations </plain></SENT>
