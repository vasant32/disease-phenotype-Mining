<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is not only correlated closely with blast cell count in bone marrow and chromosomal abnormalities but also correlated with decreased leucocyte count and function leading to acquisition of lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, clinical trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have focused on the application of haemopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, which have proven to increase neutrophil count and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these cytokines carry the risk of stimulating the malignant clone, particularly in patients with increased blast cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, investigation of cytokines which are able to stimulate neutrophil function without the potential risk of stimulating haemopoietic progenitor cells may be relevant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the stimulatory effect of interleukin-8 on neutrophil function is well known, we investigated whether recombinant human IL-8 is also able to improve the function of neutrophils gained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using three different techniques--the E. coli killing assay (8 patients), the production of reactive oxygen as determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> reduction (7 patients) and chemiluminescence (8 patients)--a significant stimulation of neutrophil function at a concentration of 10 nm IL-8 was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation with FAB classification was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IL-8 only mildly stimulated growth of myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow culture of healthy individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This minimal stimulation was blocked by a neutralizing antibody directed against GM-CSF, suggesting an indirect effect of IL-8 via secondary GM-CSF release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, IL-8 is able in vitro to repair the functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001874'>abnormalities of neutrophils</z:hpo> from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but has only a marginal influence on myeloid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
