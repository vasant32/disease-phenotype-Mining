<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been demonstrated in these therapy-related myeloid disorders which often evolve into refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of these patients with conventional chemotherapy has been dismal and only allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers a potential cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe two patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after chemo/radiotherapy and had a spontaneous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated with MOPP-ABVD hybrid therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and dyserythropoiesis associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other was treated with a combination of chemotherapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> for Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and dyserythropoiesis associated with an 11q23 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients received rhG-CSF after their cycles of chemotherapy and were considered for a bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marrow aspirates at frequent intervals showed gradual disappearance of the abnormal clone with parallel normalization of the peripheral count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both patients G-CSF might have played a role in the development of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
