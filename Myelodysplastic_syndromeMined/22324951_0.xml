<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are known to manifest overt rheumatic manifestations and have distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> but their clinical significance has yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the prevalence of autoimmune or rheumatic manifestations in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and serological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> which have been detected at presentation and to determine their clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eleven patients diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> between 2001 and 2004 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their clinical and serologic features on medical records were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 111 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 25 showed 27 autoimmune or rheumatic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On dividing the cohort into two groups, with and without autoimmune or rheumatic manifestations, the two groups were not statistically different in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> were observed by variable rate, but had no association with compatible clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C3 hypocomplementemia was observed as high as 45.9% and the C3 hypocomplementemic subgroup had more severe cytopenia of red cell and white cell lineages and was dominant in the low-risk International Prognostic Scoring System category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that a distinct subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, demonstrating complement activation, has more severe cytopenias, which suggest complement activation contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune cytopenia in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
