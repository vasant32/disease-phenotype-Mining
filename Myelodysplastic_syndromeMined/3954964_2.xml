<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first patient the typical translocation was associated with anomalies commonly found in preleukaemic states, i.e. a 5q- and a 20q- chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in both patients the long arm of chromosome no. 1 was trisomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic follow-up in the second patient demonstrated a proliferative advantage of the cells bearing a t(1;15) translocation over the cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as well as over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This karyotypic evolution, however, was not accompanied by a transformation of the haematological disorder into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
