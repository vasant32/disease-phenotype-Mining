<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report four adult patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in whom bone marrow involvement with hematologic manifestations was the predominant clinical feature at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with a leukoerythroblastic blood picture and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case, the unusual hematologic manifestations, with bone marrow replacement and the presence of immature forms in the peripheral blood, led to consideration of alternative hematologic diagnoses, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in three cases and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnoses were established by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow for two cases and by flow cytometry on aspirated bone marrow or peripheral blood lymphocytes for the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual hematologic presentations, particularly in the elderly </plain></SENT>
