<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> has been attributed to destruction of the patient's incompatible erythrocytes by donor-derived anti-A and/or anti-B antibody produced from "passenger" immunocompetent donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extraordinary transfusion requirements of group O erythrocytes in a series of patients receiving unrelated minor ABO-incompatible marrow grafts led us to investigate whether this mechanism could account for the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven consecutive minor ABO-incompatible unrelated-donor bone marrow transplant recipients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> without posttransplant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, we observed excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For cases in this index group, a strongly reactive donor-derived ABO blood group antibody was identified coincident with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion requirements in the first three patients (26 U of group O erythrocytes each) greatly exceeded the recipient's volume of incompatible erythrocytes, indicating that lysis of transfused group O erythrocytes was also occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant erythrocyte exchange transfusion with group O erythrocytes performed in the four subsequent patients decreased the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, but did not prevent it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among minor ABO-incompatible marrow graft recipients, an analysis of variance demonstrated effects on transfusion requirements due to donor-recipient relationship being unrelated (P less than .002) and the use of posttransplant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (P = .0001), and there was interaction between these two factors (P less than .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplants from unrelated donors resulted in an exaggerated immune response to ABO blood group antigens, which was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of transfused group O erythrocytes, as well as the patient's ABO-incompatible erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This serious complication may be prevented by posttransplant immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
