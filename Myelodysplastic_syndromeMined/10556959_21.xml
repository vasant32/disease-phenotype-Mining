<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By December 1998, 122365 HLA-A,B typed volunteer marrow donors and 7207 patients had been cumulatively registered in the JMDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of HLA-matching between donors and patients revealed that 5684 out of 7207 (78.9%) patients could have at least one HLA-A,B,DR serologically matched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these matched pairs, 1829 unrelated bone marrow transplants (UR-BMT) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial 500 UR-BMT transplanted from January 1993 to October 1995 were analyzed as of July 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probability of the occurrence of grade III and IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 18.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients who had standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and did not suffer from grade III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (n = 154) was 60-71% and the rate of survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be stated that UR-BMT is a modality of treatment which is as effective as related BMT if the occurrence of grade III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD is predicted and prevented </plain></SENT>
