<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients took oral herbal concoctions according to their TCM syndromes for 24 weeks while continuing with western medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of this group of 31 patients was 61 (26--84) years old and median disease duration was 5 years (0.3--40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCM herbs were well tolerated in these patients with multiple comorbidities and previous disease-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients completed the study with 5 (2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 2 with MF and 1 with SAA) achieving some degree of haematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EORTC quality of life indicators improved in more than half of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This small study offers positive results and provides the basis for future larger studies which should randomize patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MF and AA managed with standard Western medical treatment to without and with upfront combinations with TCM herbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This will conclusively define the role of TCM in the supportive management of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was registered with Clinicaltrial.gov as NCT01224496 </plain></SENT>
