<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the plasma soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level in 80 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and analyzed its correlation with hematologic/immunologic parameters and the subsequent clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, the plasma sIL-2R level was significantly elevated in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (three other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the plasma sIL-2R level and the absolute counts of T and natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the plasma sIL-2R level showed a significant positive correlation with the total cell mass and blast mass in particular, in the marrow, but not with the absolute count of IL-2Ralpha-chain-positive lymphocytes in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of our 40 low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects developed at least one of the following events during the follow-up period: erythrocyte transfusion dependence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> requiring hospitalization, disease progression or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma sIL-2R level was significantly higher in these patients than in event-free low-risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By logistic regression analysis of various parameters in the 40 low-risk subjects, the plasma sIL-2R level was identified as a valuable independent parameter for predicting the development of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the sIL-2R plays a role in the development of morbidity and mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by inducing immunologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
