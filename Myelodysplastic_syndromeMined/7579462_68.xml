<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic characteristics at diagnosis were studied in 137 consecutive cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, including 22 new cases, and correlated with the clinical characteristics and the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Balanced translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 represent primary steps in pathways leading directly to overt t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosomal deletions or losses, on the other hand, represent primary or secondary events in alternative pathways leading to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with potential for subsequent transformation to overt t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of a whole chromosome 7 (-7) or deletion of its long arm (7q-) and deletion of the long arm of a chromosome 5 (5q-) were the most frequent primary abnormalities significantly related to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of a whole chromosome 5 (-5) was also a primary event, but surprisingly, was observed equally in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion of chromosome 13, including bands q13q14, was another less common primary aberration of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for -7 and del(13q), these primary aberrations were most often observed together with secondary abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These included balanced aberrations involving band 3q26 and various deletions of chromosome 3, a gain of a whole chromosome 8, deletions of the short arm or loss of chromosomes 12 and 17, loss of a whole chromosome 18, and deletions of the short arm of chromosome 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deletions or loss or chromosomes 5 and 7 were significantly associated with previous therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (P = .002), and balanced translocations to chromosome bands 3q26, 11q23, and 21q22 were significantly associated with previous therapy with drugs targeting DNA-topoisomerase II (P &lt; .00005) </plain></SENT>
