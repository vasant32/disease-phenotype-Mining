<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of 28 patients and of a cell line showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deletions included band 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis demonstrated that the proximal part of 11q23, including NCAM, was deleted in 13 of 15 patients and the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurring chromosomal losses in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have been regarded as evidence that the affected regions contain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene is proximal to the MLL gene which is also located in 11q23 </plain></SENT>
