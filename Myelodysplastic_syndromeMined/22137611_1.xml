<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the FLAG-IDA regimen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> refractory and/or recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Descriptive, retrospective, observational study of the clinical histories of patients with the FLAG-IDA regimen during the period of 2005-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was measured using objective response, progression-free interval, and global survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety was measured using the NCI classification system of common toxicity criteria for adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We registered 12 patients (52.17±8.26 years in women, and 54.83±7.22 years in men), 11 cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (5 refractory, 3 in recurrence, 1 secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 2 secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), one of which was refractory and the other had not been previously treated) and one case was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> refractory lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (50%) reached a complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient reached a partial response (PR), which was followed by another protocol that produced a CR, two died due to disease progression, and three due to secondary complications from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The progression-free interval for patients that reached a CR was 24.38 weeks (6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median global survival was 8.4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean time needed for the recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was 23 and 37 days in the first and second cycle, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean time required for recuperation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was 24 and 35 days in each cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FLAG-IDA induction regimen for the treatment of high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> patients is an established protocol, with good tolerance and acceptable toxicity levels that offers an opportunity for facilitating the transplantation of haematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
