<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinical and laboratory data indicated that the FAB classification, the Bournemouth, Dusseldorf, Goasguen, Sanz and FAB Scoring Systems were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> good predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found advancing age, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) &lt; or = 9 g/dl, platelet count &lt; or = 50 x 10(9)/l, increased peripheral total white cell count (WCC) and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, increased bone marrow blasts, dysgranulopoiesis, and bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were significant adverse prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The commonest complication and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; however, infective episodes were not significantly associated with low neutrophil counts (either &lt; or = 1.5 x 10(9)/l or &lt; or = 0.8 x 10(9)/l) and there was also no significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> plays an important role in the clinical progression of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of new therapeutic modalities, such as the haemopoietic growth factors, on reducing infective episodes may be as significant as their effect on increasing neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
