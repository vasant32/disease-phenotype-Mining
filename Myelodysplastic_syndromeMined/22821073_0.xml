<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether a young human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor (MUD) should be preferred as donor to an HLA-identical sibling (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) for older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (â‰¥ 50 years) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of 719 MDS patients with a median age of 58 years (range, 50-73 years) who received AHSCT from related (n=555) or unrelated (n=164) donors between 1999 and 2008 and reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median donor age of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was 56 years (range: 35-78), in contrast to 34 years (range: 19-64) for the MUDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Influence of donor's age on survival was not observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> (hazard ratio (HR): 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-1.02), P=0.2), but there was a significant impact of MUD's age on outcome (HR: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06); P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation from younger MUDs (&lt;30 years) had a significant improved 5-year overall survival in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and older MUDs (&gt;30 years): 40% vs 33% vs 24% (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, AHSCT from young MUD (&lt;30 years) remained a significant factor for improved survival in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> (HR: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.45-0.95), P=0.03), which should be considered in donor selection for older patients </plain></SENT>
