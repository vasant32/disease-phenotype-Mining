<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responses were evaluated according to the International Working Group criteria at week 16 for 39 patients who received at least 8 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (59%) patients showed haematological improvement (HI): four major erythroid response (HI-EM), 15 minor erythroid response, six major neutrophil response, two major platelet response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects caused 22/39 to stop thalidomide before week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of 23 responders continued thalidomide after week 16 [19% of trial patients] with sustained response in eight of nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six reached week 56, including the four HI-EM patients [13% of trial patients] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 36 red blood cell transfusion-dependent patients (53%) showed erythroid response, but only four became transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 responders, the median duration of response was 260 d (range 30-650) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responses were sustained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one, and were observed between week 4 and week 8 in 85% of patients, at doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients responded at 600 mg/d and none at 800 mg/d </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The erythroid response rate was identical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytogenetic subgroups, including 5q31.1 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment vascular endothelial growth factor levels were lower in responders compared with non-responders (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density (MVD) increased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> decreased in four of six and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six responders studied respectively whereas MVD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were unchanged in three non-responders </plain></SENT>
