<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), eight RA with ringed-sideroblast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 30 RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), and 28 RAEB in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had a significantly lower number of GM colonies and a significantly higher cluster to colony ratio than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with cytopenias of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six in vitro growth patterns were observed; 85% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed various abnormal growth patterns, and 42% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exhibited a leukemic growth pattern at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 40 patients with cytopenias of other causes had a leukemic type growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A leukemic growth pattern was rarely observed in patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (4%), but was common in other subgroups (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of various growth patterns was not statistically different among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with leukemic type growth were at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and they also had a shorter survival time than patients with a non-leukemic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results showed that simply scoring the number of CFU-GM is of limited value for the diagnosis and the prediction of prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas the in vitro marrow culture growth pattern is of prognostic significance independently of the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the in vitro growth pattern of marrow CFU-GM is helpful in diagnosing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as in predicting their clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
