<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clofarabine is a second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> analog that has been synthesized to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best qualities of fludarabine and cladribine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clofarabine acts by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphates</z:chebi> available for DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to its precursors, clofarabine has an increased resistance to deamination and phosphorolysis, and hence better stability as well as higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the initiation of the first phase I study of clofarabine in 1993 in patients with hematologic and solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to its unique properties of biochemical modulation when used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, mainly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, combination regimens containing clofarabine have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review describes the development, pharmacology and clinical activity of clofarabine, as well as its emerging role in the treatment of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
