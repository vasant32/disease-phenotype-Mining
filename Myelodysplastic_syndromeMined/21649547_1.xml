<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we applied array based miRNA profiling to study 19 bone marrow cell samples of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with eight healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, integration of the miRNA profiling data with our previous array comparative genomic hybridization data, from the same cohort of patients, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed up-regulation of hsa-miR-720 and hsa-miR-21, and down-regulation of hsa-miR-671-5p and one human virus miRNA (Epstein-Barr virus miR-BART13) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, the copy number alteration harboring miRNA was not affecting miRNA expression, but a distinct microRNA expression pattern was observed, not only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with controls, but also between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> entities </plain></SENT>
