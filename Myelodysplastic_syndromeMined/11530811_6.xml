<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a childhood case that showed the repeated appearance and disappearance of various kinds of cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) for 5.5 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor during the second complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen for BMT consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin, and total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no leukemic relapses or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) since the BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CA occurred from residual recipient cells, which were damaged by chemotherapy or radiation prior to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies about post-BMT CA had reported the continuous emergence of identical clones, the present case showed the appearance of one different type of clone after another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the appearance of different types of CA may mean that these clones did not obtain any growth advantages, it may be a sign of genomic instability, which is probably a risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
