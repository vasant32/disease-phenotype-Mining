<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is a challenge for evaluating response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have used various criteria to assess results, making cross-study comparisons problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2000, an International Working Group (IWG) proposed standardized response criteria for evaluating clinically significant responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These criteria included measures of alteration in the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, hematologic</z:e> improvement, cytogenetic response, and improvement in health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relevance of the response criteria has now been validated prospectively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clinical trials, and they have gained acceptance in research studies and in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because limitations of the IWG criteria have surfaced, based on practical and reported experience, some modifications were warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present recommendations for revisions of some of the initial criteria </plain></SENT>
