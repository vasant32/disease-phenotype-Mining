<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared metaphase chromosomal analyses on bone marrow aspirates from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for chromosomes nos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E1996 for low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and five patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E3996 for high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied by both metaphase chromosomal analysis and interphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluding those with a clonal loss of the Y chromosome, an abnormal clone was detected by cytogenetic analysis in 18 of 48 samples (37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison, our FISH panel detected an abnormal clone in 17 of 48 samples (35.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of 30 samples with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, including those with a missing Y chromosome, were also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by our FISH panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had an occult deletion of chromosome 11 that was detected by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that around 60% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> do not have abnormalities that are detectable by either chromosomal or FISH studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, it appears that interphase FISH studies are nearly as sensitive as cytogenetic analyses and can be a useful tool in studying bone marrow aspirates where cytogenetic analysis is not possible </plain></SENT>
