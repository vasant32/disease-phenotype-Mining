<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover some recent experiences also suggested a possible role in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From April 1990 to April 1992, 23 patients (16 males and 7 females, median age 63.5 years) affected with low risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to ameliorate Hb levels and transfusional requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received high doses of rHuEPO (800 U/Kg weekly s.c. in 2-3 divided doses, for 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complete remission, defined as stable normalization of Hb level, was achieved in 1/23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, by FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A partial response, defined as stable increase of Hb levels &gt; or = 1 g/dl and/or reduction of transfusional requirement &gt; or = 50% lasting at least 3 months, was achieved in 7/23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a partial response received rHuEPO at increased dosages (1200 U/Kg weekly s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2-3 times): 1/7 achieved a complete response, 4/7 remained stable and 2/7 decreased to pre-therapy Hb value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rHuEPO may be a promising therapeutic tool for some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
