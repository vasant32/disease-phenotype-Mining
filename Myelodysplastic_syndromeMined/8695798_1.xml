<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subgroups could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-Es) were cultured from CD34+/CD36- sorted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from these patients did have the capacity to differentiate to colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-Es) progenitors in cell suspension cultures with Epo plus MGF followed by Epo in the culture assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cells became CD34-/CD36+/gly-cophorin A (GpA)+ after 7 days of culture with Epo plus MGF, a pattern comparable to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 8 patients, a different pattern was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No BFU-Es or a low number of BFU-Es were cultured from the CD34+/CD36- sorted cell fraction that was, in most of the cases, incapable of differentiating to CFU-E progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry of the sorted population showed that, after 7 days of culture with Epo plus MGF, a high proportion of CD34+/CD36- cells persisted, whereas a low proportion of cells became CD34-/CD36+/GpA+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unresponsiveness is not caused by the used growth factor combination, because the addition of interleukin-3 did not correct the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 expression was studied in 9 cases to show whether an aberrant Evi-1 expression correlates with a disturbed erythroid development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 expression was shown in 4 of 9 cases, whereas 3 of 9 cases did have a disturbed erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results show that the defects in the erythroid development in a subpopulation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> is localized at an early stage of the erythroid differentiation and is associated with the persistent expression of the CD34 antigen and, in some cases, with the expression of Evi-1 </plain></SENT>
