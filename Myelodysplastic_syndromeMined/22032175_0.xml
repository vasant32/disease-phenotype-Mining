<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that can range from cutaneous to disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and can be fatal within months of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present a case of disseminated S. apiospermum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with cutaneous manifestations in a 59-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, in remission from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and deteriorating mental status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An X-ray computed tomography scan showed three non-contrast-enhancing hypodensities affecting the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many erythematous, indurated <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, measuring 3-5 mm in diameter, were noted on her chest, shoulders and arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were submitted for culture and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examination revealed superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scattered collections of fungal organisms were noted near the eccrine glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff with diastase stain showed the presence of variable sized spores and hyphae with some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angle branching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both tissue and blood cultures were positive for a single Scedosporium species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, eccrine or peri-eccrine involvement by fungi may be an important finding for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Scedosporium infection</z:e> of the skin </plain></SENT>
