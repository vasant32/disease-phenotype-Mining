<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> show characteristic karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most distinctive of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, poorly lobulated megakaryocytes, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q deletion) as the sole karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, several genes encoding hemopoietic growth factors and receptors, comprising the interleukins 3, 4, and 5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [the CSF1R (formerly FMS) gene product], have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, and there has been much speculation that deletion of one or more of these genes may be critical to the pathogenesis of the associated myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One candidate gene is CSF1R, which is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a molecular examination of the CSF1R, both on the 5q- chromosome and on the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homologous chromosome 5, in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and a 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have found, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and gene dosage experiments, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients showed deletion of CSF1R; 6 of 10 were hemizygous and 4 of 10 homozygous for CSF1R loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The homozygous CSF1R loss has been confirmed in 2 patients by an in situ hybridization technique comparing the signal in affected cells to that in control sex-mismatched cells on the same slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those patients considered to have homozygous CSF1R loss by DNA experiments the gene was deleted from the 5q chromosome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells and from the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 5 in a subset of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This loss of one CSF1R allele, together with loss in some cells of the remaining allele on the homologous chromosome 5, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> indicates that this is a region of critical gene loss on 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The loss of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor gene CSF1R may be important in the pathogenesis of human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
