<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report a 58-year-old female who originally presented with acquired pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the serum erythropoietin level was highly elevated and no T-cell mediated inhibition of erythropoiesis was demonstrated in coculture studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional immunosuppressive therapy proved ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A year later a diagnosis of hyperfibrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequential bone marrow examinations in the course of the three years showed a progressive increase in bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, terminating in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This sequence of the events included the appearance of del(5)(q13q33), four years after setting a diagnosis of PRCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that the absence of both cytogenetic abnormality and the signs of dyshematopoiesis at the diagnosis of PRCA does not exclude ultimately a "clonal" category of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, repeated hematological and cytogenetical reevaluations are recommended </plain></SENT>
