<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No satisfactory treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">Sodium valproate</z:chebi> (VPA) can inhibit the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by inducing G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the effects of VPA on the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line MUTZ-1, and explore possible mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MUTZ-1 cells were treated with VPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was observed under microscope and transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of p21(WAF1) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VPA inhibited the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells in concentration-and time-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When treated with 4 mmol/L VPA for 72 h, typical apoptotic morphologic features appeared in MUTZ-1 cells: condensation of cells and nuclear chromatin, disintegration of nuclear chromatin, and apoptotic bodies were observed under microscope; aggregation and margination of apoptotic nuclear chromatin, cytoplasm condensation, and irregular chromatin masses were observed under transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate was significantly higher in the cells treated with 1, 2, and 4 mmol/L VPA for 72 h than in untreated cells [(3.14+/-0.87)%, (14.90+/-1.04)% and (22.46+/-1.74)% vs. (0.99+/-0.35)%, P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After treatment of VPA, cell cycle was arrested obviously at G0/G1 phase (P&lt;0.05)รป the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of p21(WAF1) were up-regulated in MUTZ-1 cells (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VPA could induce G(0)/G(1) phase arrest, inhibit the proliferation and induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUTZ-1 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be associated with the up-regulation of p21(WAF1) </plain></SENT>
