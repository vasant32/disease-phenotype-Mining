<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During their natural history, the clinical picture reveals both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could affect the microvessels, and also the large vessels, including even less usual territories (suprahepatic veins, porta vein, pulmonary vein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are many factors contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorders--the associated comorbidities, the numeric alterations of blood elements and also the disorders of the platelet's function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, there were described quantitative and qualitative anomalies of platelet's receptors: GP Ib, GP IIb/IIIa, GP IV, GP VI, thrombopoietin receptor of the platelet cMPL, the increase of platelet activation; the increase of P selectin and thrombospondin and the increase on GP IIb/IIIa expression--they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An important role has been attributed to JAK2 mutation, which affects the platelet receptor for thrombopoietin cMPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative syndrome, it is favored by many disorders in platelet's function, such as: the decrease of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor's receptor of the platelet, which leads to acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005129" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bernard Soulier syndrome</z:e>; quantitative and qualitative disorders of dense granules of the platelet, decrease of the secretion and platelet aggregation after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and collagen stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also described the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired von Willebrand syndrome</z:e>, most frequently type 2 </plain></SENT>
