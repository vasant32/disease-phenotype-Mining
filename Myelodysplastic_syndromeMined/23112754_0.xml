<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that early consequences of genomic instability result in shared regions with copy number variation in different precursor cells that originate distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002898'>embryonal tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed a newborn girl with FA and VL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0009777'>aplasia of the thumbs</z:hpo>, cloacal atresia (urogenital sinus), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> at L3/L4, muscular ventricular septum defect, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000085'>horseshoe-kidney</z:hpo> with a single ureter) who simultaneously acquired an epithelial-type WT in the left portion of the kidney and a poorly differentiated adrenal NB in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel homozygous germline frameshift mutation in PALB2 (c.1676_c1677delAAinsG) leading to protein truncation (pGln526ArgfsX1) inherited from consanguineous parents formed the genetic basis of FA-N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and induced <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> was detected in the majority of cells analyzed from peripheral lymphocytes, bone marrow, and cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells also showed complex chromosome rearrangements consistent with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> at 11 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Array-comparative genomic hybridization analyses of both WT and NB showed shared gains or amplifications within the chromosomal regions 11p15.5 and 17q21.31-q25.3, including genes that are reportedly implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development such as IGF2, H19, WT2, BIRC5, and HRAS </plain></SENT>
