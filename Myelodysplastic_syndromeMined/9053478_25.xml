<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> given BMT and reported to the European Working Group on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndrome</z:hpo> in Childhood (EWOG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) data base were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 25 cases, the donor was a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical or a one-antigen-disparate relative, in four cases a mismatched family donor, and in 14 a matched unrelated donor (MUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy in 22 patients, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu) with other cytotoxic drugs was used in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 43 patients (14%), five of whom received transplants from alternative donors, failed to engraft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) between children transplanted from compatible/one-antigen-mismatched relatives and from alternative donors (23% and 87%, respectively; P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probabilities of transplant-related mortality for children given BMT from HLA-identical/one-antigen-disparate relatives or from MUD/ mismatched relatives were 9% and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of relapse for the entire group was 58%, whereas the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EFS rate for children given BMT from an HLA-identical sibling or one-antigen-disparate relative was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this latter group, patients who received Bu had a better EFS compared with those given TBI (62% v 11%, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and an HLA-compatible relative should be transplanted as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement of donor selection, GVHD prophylaxis, and supportive care are needed to ameliorate results of BMT from alternative donors </plain></SENT>
