<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) by the platelet count 4.8 x 10(4)/microliter, Platelet associated IgG (PAIgG) 88.5 ng/10(7) cells, and an increase of megakaryocyte (81/microliter) of the sternal bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No obvious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of three lineages was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because she did not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and gamma globulin, she was undertaken splenectomy 3 years after the diagnosis and the platelet count had been kept more than 3.0 x 10(4)/microliter during the following 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 7 years from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, she was admitted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (16500 microliters with 8% monocytes) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1.9 x 10(4)/microliter) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypercellular bone marrow with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of three lineages such as dyserythropoiesis, Pelger like nucleus, and micromegakaryocyte was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal analysis presented 46XX, del (20) (q11.2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (50/50) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a difficult case in which it was distinguish <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> from refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, a subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We reexamined and found some morphological abnormalities at diagnosis, suggesting that it might be preleukemic stage </plain></SENT>
