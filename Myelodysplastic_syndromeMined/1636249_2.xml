<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was established by histopathology according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, and reassessed by haematological data and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal karyotypic changes were found in 30 of the 51 patients (59%): in 15 of 19 (79%) patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 7 of 11 (64%) with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 6 of 10 (60%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, and 2 of 11 (18%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following three features of the histopathology revealed positive correlations with karyotype abnormalities: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (7/51) were accompanied by chromosome aberrations, microforms of megakaryocytes with reduced nuclear lobulation were observed in 18 of 30 cases with karyotype changes, and hypocellularity of haematopoiesis was associated with aberrations of chromosome 7 in 2 of 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No positive correlations were revealed between abnormal karyotypes and the transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival times were significantly decreased in patients with complex (3 and more) karyotype changes, when compared with patients with single (1-2) chromosome aberrations or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, independently of the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
