<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neutrophilic disease is characterized by aseptic visceral infiltration by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can occur in any organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Association with an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, is frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may produce a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e>, but diagnosis is usually based on <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> because of their clinical and histological accessibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary manifestations are the most common extracutaneous symptoms but may be misdiagnosed, as in our case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old woman with IgA <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> presented with an inflammatory bullous plaque of the leg coupled with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> lasting one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical and histological examinations were evocative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was initially obtained with systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The course became complicated by necrotic neutrophilic papulopustular lesions of the upper limbs and pulmonary manifestations, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and decline in overall condition occurring the day after administration of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis of septic aetiology prompted antibiotic and antifungal therapy, which remained ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient died the day after the second erythropoietin injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This case involved late identification of the aseptic neutrophilic aetiology of pulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several factors favouring their appearance and the fatal outcome may be suggested: the existence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and the possible iatrogenic action of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extracutaneous neutrophilic infiltrate occurring in a patient treated with this haematopoietic hormone </plain></SENT>
