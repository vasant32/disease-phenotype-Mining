<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to describe the natural history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> in the elderly and to evaluate the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and the possible occurrence of other pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated 178 ITP patients (82 men, 96 women; mean age: 72 yr) diagnosed between 1981 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy was started at diagnosis or during follow-up, depending on the platelet count and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six out of one hundred and seventy-eight patients (37%) initiated therapy at diagnosis; whereas in 11 of the 112 untreated patients (9.8%) therapy was necessary during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was the first-line treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (mean daily dose of 0.43 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (63.6%) of the seventy-seven treated patients showed a response, 14 of these (28.6%) suffered a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another pathology occurred in 19 of the 178 patients (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> is an appropriate initial treatment for elderly persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also stress that an adequate follow-up is advisable, given that isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> could in some cases be the first sign of another underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
