<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that serum levels of VEGF, bFGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly elevated compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of VEGF and bFGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> patients were higher than that in RA patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference of serum levels of VEGF and bFGF was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of VEGF and bFGF were correlated with the affected peripheral blood cells and the proportion of blast cells in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was positive correlation between serum VEGF and bFGF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the secretion of VEGF and bFGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is elevated and the serum levels of VEGF and bFGF are related to the classification and prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
