<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clonal assays, IL3 supported the growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colony types including megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colonies were formed in the presence of IL3 and erythropoietin, but not in the absence of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Replating experiments using blast cell colonies derived from a cell population enriched for progenitor cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with the monoclonal antibody 3C5, showed that IL3 supported the continued replating of colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clonal proliferation of human bone marrow cells in response to IL3 was inhibited by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and by lymphotoxin, but not by interferon-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In suspension cultures, IL3 supported the proliferation of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human IL3 had no effect on the growth responses, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytochemistry, or clonogenicity of the human leukemic cell lines HL60, U-937, KG1a, and HEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcripts for IL3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were not detectable in these cells, nor in the K562 cell line, implying that autocrine secretion of IL3 was not the mechanism by which these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although cells derived from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> frequently showed proliferative responses to IL3, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts for IL3 were not detected in these cells </plain></SENT>
