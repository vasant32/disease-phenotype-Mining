<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the significance of immunomorphometric assessment of megakaryocyte size and number in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared morphometric characteristics of megakaryocytes in 56 bone marrow trephine biopsies stained by immunohistochemical and conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphometric results showed that precise megakaryocyte size in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic samples can be calculated even by using conventional staining technique, but only employing specific stereological corrections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunomorphometric evaluation revealed populations of "small" megakaryocytes (&lt; 14 microns), "morphologically unrecognized" by conventional staining technique (promegakaryoblasts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and stimulated as well as micromegakaryocytes in pathologic bone marrow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and stimulated megakaryocytopoises percentage of "small" megakaryocytes was generally low (10.6% and 14%, respect.); so, megakaryocyte number was similar in immunohistochemically and conventionally stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, percentages of "small" megakaryocytes were significantly higher in patients with stem cell disorders (namely, myelodisplastic syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_338'>granulocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>), as compared to controls (35.3% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 22.9% in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 10.6% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those patients megakaryocyte numbers were more sensitively detected by immunohistochemistry than by conventional staining </plain></SENT>
