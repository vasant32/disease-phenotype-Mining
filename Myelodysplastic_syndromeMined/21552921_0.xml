<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 29 patients (59%) CD34 and in 19 patients (39%) <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> positivity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both immunocytological markers showed a strong positive correlation (p&lt;0.0005) and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> expression was only detectable in CD34 positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When comparing CD34 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> expression with well established prognostic parameters, medullary bone marrow (BM) blast percentage was found to be the sole variable which correlated with expression of both cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> negative patients had a better prognosis although only the difference between CD34 positive and CD34 negative cases reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the prognostic value of immunocytological results and other clinical and hematological parameters medullary blast cell infiltration remained the strongest predictive variable for survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients sequential immunocytological analysis during progression of disease were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to stable CD34 expression a marked increase in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development could be noted in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
