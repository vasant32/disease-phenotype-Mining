<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal (i.e., "leukemic" or absent) growth of GM colonies (CFU-GM) and GM clusters was found in 47% of patients with "advanced" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) and in 15% of "low-risk" (RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro erythropoiesis was decreased in most of the patients, with significantly lower number of BFU-E in "advanced" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-MK) were very low or absent in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, regardless of the FAB type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was demonstrated between the number of BFU-E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and between number of CFU-MK and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Growth capacity of GM progenitors appears to be in proportion to "myeloproliferative" capacity of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> had no influence on growth capacity of hematopoietic progenitors, nor did colony growth respond in a dose-dependent manner to different concentrations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Growth capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hematopoietic progenitors was independent of Bournemouth score, of the presence and type of cytogenetic abnormality, and of the expression of CD95 and caspase-3 antigens on bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with "abnormal" growth of GM progenitors, CD34 antigen expression was significantly higher than in patients with "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" growth. "Abnormal" GM growth was found to be independently predictive regarding the survival and the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the prognostic value of erythroid and megakaryocyte cultures was found to be limited </plain></SENT>
