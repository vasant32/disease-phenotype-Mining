<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan showed a left upper lobe pulmonary mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary capillary pullback specimens were collected to determine infectious verses neoplastic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary capillary pullback specimens showed atypical mononuclear cells with enlarged, slightly irregular nuclei; visible nucleoli; and basophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of the specimen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric immunophenotypic studies showed that 78% of the cells were CD34 positive, CD45 dim positive and CD11c positive, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>75% of the cells expressed CD5 as well as dim CD20 and were monoclonal for kappa light chains: consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At this time the clinician communicated a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood was obtained for further immunophenotyping and the patient was immediately treated for his <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that a diagnostic antibody panel should allow evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types as per the U.S./Canadian consensus recommendations on the immunophenotypic analysis of hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by flow cytometry (Stewart et al.: Cytometry 30:231-235, 1997) </plain></SENT>
