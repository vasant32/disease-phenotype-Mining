<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new sensitive method for the measurement of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> (ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>), an intracellular active metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi> (ara-C), in human materials in vivo has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An acid-soluble fraction containing ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was extracted from blastic cells by ara-C treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30956">trichloroacetic acid</z:chebi> (final concentration, 0.3 M) neutralized with an equal volume of cold freon containing 0.5 M tri-n-octylamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> fraction was separated from the acid -soluble fraction by high-performance liquid chromatography (TSK gel diethylaminoethyl-2 SW column) eluted with 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and 20% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was lyophilized, dephosphorylated to ara-C by incubation with 10 units alkaline phosphatase for 12 h at 55 degrees C, and measured by RIA using anti-ara-C serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery through the whole procedure was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> cell line K562, the intracellular ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> levels produced when the cells were incubated with ara-c were assayed as above, and they showed a linear increase depending on Ara-C concentrations from 0.01 to 10 microns, demonstrating a very close correlation with the labeled ara <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> levels yielded by cells on incubation with radiolabeled ara-C (r2 = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection limit was 0.1 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, and a sample amount of only 5 x 10(6) cells was enough for each assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the clinical applications, our method proved capable of detecting a wide concentration range of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> produced when patients were treated with ara-C or its derivatives from very low to intermediate doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No radiolabeled drug was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method was very useful for in vivo pharmacodynamic studies of ara-C therapy </plain></SENT>
