<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the possible genes involved in this translocation, we studied 6 cases with a t(3;5) by fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes directed against the nucleophosmin (NPM), EVI1, and Ribophorin genes, as well as a newly developed myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> factor 1 (MLF1) BAC clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histologic spectrum of the cases was variable, ranging from refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An NPM/MLF1 fusion was identified in 5 of 6 cases, whereas the EVI1 and Ribophorin genes were not involved in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NPM/MLF1-positive cases were predominantly young adult males (median age, 33 years) who responded well to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that an NPM/MLF1 fusion is the primary molecular abnormality in t(3;5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and also that cases with NPM/MLF1 may be clinically distinct from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated disease </plain></SENT>
