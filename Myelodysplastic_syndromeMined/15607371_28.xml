<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been defined as primitive, undifferentiated cells, capable of self-renewal and with the ability to give rise to different cell lineages, including adipocytes, osteocytes, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSC are key components of the hematopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies, including some from our own group, suggest that important quantitative and functional alterations are present in the stroma of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in most of such studies the stroma has been analyzed as a complex network of different cell types and molecules, thus it has been difficult to identify and characterize the cell(s) type(s) that is (are) altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have focused on the biological characterization of MSC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a first approach, we have quantified their numbers in bone marrow, and have worked on their phenotypic (<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype) and cytogenetic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSC were obtained by a negative selection procedure and cultured in a MSC liquid culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, as well as the expression of certain cell markers, no differences were observed between MSC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and those derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases, MSC expressed CD29, CD90, CD105 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">Prolyl</z:chebi>-4-hydroxylase; in contrast, they did not express CD14, CD34, CD68, or alkaline phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in five out of nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, MSC developed in culture showed cytogenetic abnormalities, usually involving the loss of chromosomal material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> those five cases also showed cytogenetic abnormalities in their hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in some cases there was a complete lack of overlap between the karyotypes of hematopoietic cells and MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first in which a pure population of MSC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is analyzed in terms of their whole karyotype and demonstrates that in a significant proportion of patients, MSC are cytogenetically abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the reason of this is still unclear, such alterations may have an impact on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess the functional integrity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived MSC </plain></SENT>
