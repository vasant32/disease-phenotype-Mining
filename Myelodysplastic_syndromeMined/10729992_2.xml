<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old woman presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> showed cyclic oscillations in her white blood cell and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each cycle lasted for 5 to 6 months, with 4 cycles occurring over the course of a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During successive cycles, the white blood cell count fluctuated from 10.1 to 2.6; 13.8 to 1.8; 11.0 to 1.6, and 8.6 to 1.3 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelet count fluctuated from 242 to 38, 199 to 11, 110 to 5, and 75 to 3 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent red blood cell transfusions because of red blood cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>; the frequency of the transfusions and the erythropoietin concentration in serum were inversely correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of circulating granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and CD34-positive cells in peripheral blood oscillated in phase with the white blood cell and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patterns suggested a periodic influx of progenitor cells from hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of neutrophils to mononuclear cells remained essentially constant throughout the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subset assessments using monoclonal antibodies showed an inverse CD4/CD8 ratio (less than 1) and extreme B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> throughout the fourth cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD3-positive cells oscillated inversely, suggesting that the cyclic cytopenia had an immune mechanism involving T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
