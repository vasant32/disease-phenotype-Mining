<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present absence of any curative therapy, a recent case report describing the efficacy of cladribine showed promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a pilot study, the efficacy of cladribine (0.10-0.13 mg/kg in a 2-hour infusion, days 1-5; repeated at 4-8 weeks until 6 cycles) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with SM with severe symptoms were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients were classified as having indolent or smoldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, 3 as having aggressive systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, and 3 as having SM with an accompanying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolonged follow-up is required, as response is ongoing in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed within 11 months and showed a second response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side effects were mainly related to bone marrow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Single-agent cladribine is an effective and relatively safe treatment for severe systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
