<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in the cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with DS-AL but not those with DS-TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The younger ages and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations, platelet counts, and WBC counts of DS-TMD patients provided a clinical contrast with the frankly leukemic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, characterized by a small percentage of leukemic blast cells, was observed in 11 of the 13 patients with DS-AL compared with none in the DS-TMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy disclosed a positive platelet peroxidase reaction in each of the 11 DS-TMD patients and in nine of the 13 DS-AL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunologic studies revealed antiplatelet-megakaryocyte antigens on the blast cells of the majority of patients in both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the blast cells in cases of DS-AL and DS-TMD arise from cells of the megakaryocytic lineage or from a myeloid progenitor with the capacity for megakaryocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high risk of the development of AL in patients with DS who are less than 3 years old may be related to increased megakaryocyte proliferation in this age group </plain></SENT>
