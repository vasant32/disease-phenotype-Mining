<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we analyzed the distribution and phenotype of bone marrow hematopoietic cells from 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients (15 symptomatic and 32 high-risk smoldering) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the 32 smoldering <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients, 18 were studied at baseline and 22 after nine cycles of lenalidomide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment following the QUIREDEX trial (including 8 from baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic alterations of bone marrow cells of 7 (47%) symptomatic and 6 (33%) smoldering <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients were detected at baseline; there was no difference in the frequency and extent of phenotypic alterations between symptomatic versus smoldering cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no difference was seen between smoldering <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients studied at baseline versus after lenalidomide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that phenotypic alterations of bone marrow hematopoietic cells are often present in newly diagnosed symptomatic and smoldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
