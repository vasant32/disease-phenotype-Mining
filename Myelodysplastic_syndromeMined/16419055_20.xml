<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome rearrangements are found in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, genes at the breakpoints can be disrupted, forming fusion genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the genes involved in several chromosome aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> is NUP98 (11p15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As NUP98 is close to the 11p telomere, small translocations might easily be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a NUP98-specific split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe combination, we analyzed 84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes or 11p abnormalities to investigate whether there are unidentified 11p15 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither NUP98 translocations nor deletions were identified in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, indicating these aberrations may be very rare in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, NUP98 deletions were observed in four cases with unbalanced 11p aberrations, indicating that the breakpoint is centromeric of NUP98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of NUP98 were identified in two patients, both showing 11p abnormalities in the diagnostic karyotype: a t(4;11)(q1?3;p15) with expression of the NUP98-RAP1GDS1 fusion product detected in a 60-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M0, and an add(11)(p15) with a der(21)t(11;21)(p15;p13) observed cytogenetically in a 1-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JARID1A was identified as the fusion partner of NUP98 using 3' RACE, RT-PCR, and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>JARID1A, at 12p13, codes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> binding protein 2, a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of JARID1A as a partner gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
