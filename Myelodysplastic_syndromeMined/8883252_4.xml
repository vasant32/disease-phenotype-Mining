<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report herein the case of a 61-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> who underwent successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, his <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) value was 10.4 g/dl while receiving transfusions of 1 or 2 units of red blood cells (RBC) every 2 weeks, his white blood cell (WBC) count was 8200/microliter with injections of 100 micrograms granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-SCF) every 5 days, and his platelet count was 4.5 x 10(4)/ microliter without platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the time the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in his peripheral blood, he had received a total of 104 units of RBC and 472 units of platelets, following which he developed an antiplatelet antibody, not for a platelet-specific antigen, but for an HLA antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, HLA-matched platelets were prepared to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and the WBC count was elevated preoperatively by G-CSF injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, CABG was performed on three vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HLA-matched platelets were transfused as the patient was weaned from the extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of these preparations, we were able to protect the patient against <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
