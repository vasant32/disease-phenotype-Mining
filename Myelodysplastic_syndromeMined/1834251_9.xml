<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established a new nonlymphoid leukemic cell ine from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), which progressed to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The parental cell line and a subline derived from this line have absolute dependency on several cytokines for their long-term survival and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parental line designated F-36P requires granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) for continuous growth, while a subline designated F-36E can be maintained in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When these cytokines are depleted, both the parental and the subline cells die within several days, even in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>F-36E, maintained in the presence of Epo, constitutively synthesizes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> at a significant level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>F-36P, which is usually maintained in the presence of GM-CSF or IL-3, can be induced to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> when GM-CSF or IL-3 is substituted by Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surface marker profile shows that the F-36P cells are positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45) and some common multilineage markers such as CD13, CD33, and CD34, and negative for T- and B-cell antigens and mature myelomonocytic antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, some monoclonal antibodies recognizing erythroid and platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> react with these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, this cell line has a multilineage phenotype, suggesting that the transformation event occurred in a multipotent stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also evident that the F-36 cells can be induced to differentiate into the erythroid lineage in the presence of Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This, to our knowledge, is the first description of a human leukemic cell line that can be stimulated to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> by Epo </plain></SENT>
