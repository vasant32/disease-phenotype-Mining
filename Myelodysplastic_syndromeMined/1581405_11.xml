<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were randomized to receive two daily subcutaneous injections of rhGM-CSF (mammalian, glycosylated, Sandoz/Schering-Plough) at a daily dose of either 108 micrograms <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (group I) or 216 micrograms <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (group II) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as an increase in Hb (greater than 2.5 g%), neutrophil count (more than 100%), or platelet count (more than 100%) without progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of 19 patients who did not meet the entry criteria, 82 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients (66%) responded (27 of 42 patients in group I and 27 of 40 in group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressive disease was seen in two patients of group I and in four of group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the latter developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses were reflected in the granulocytic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients platelet numbers also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis, successfully performed in 43 cases, showed that 14 of 16 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes responded, compared with 14 of 27 patients with abnormal karyotypes (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In some cases GM-CSF was reduced in dose or discontinued prematurely due to side effects so that only 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable patients finished 8 weeks of treatment without a change of dose </plain></SENT>
