<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 29 of the patients, complex karyotypes were confirmed using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Commercial probes (Abbot Molecular) were used for 7q22, 7q31, and 7q35, the regions most frequently deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three cases without deletions, high-resolution multicolor banding (mBAND) for chromosome 7 revealed other aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five groups of chromosomal rearrangements were established: (a) deletion 7q as a sole aberration (2 cases), (b) deletion 7q and complex karyotypes (6 cases), (c) combined translocations and deletions of 7q (17 cases), (d) combined translocation and deletion 7p (5 cases), and (e) translocation of chromosomes 7 without deletion 7p or 7q (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three FISH-screened regions were the most frequent, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region 7p13.2 approximately p15.2 was most commonly deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the deletions were cryptic, not detectable with conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aberrations of chromosome 7 are associated with a very poor outcome; survival time in our cohort was short (median 7 months) </plain></SENT>
