<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of this translocation is not easy since the cytogenetic change is quite subtle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two genes involved in this translocation were recently isolated and diagnosis at the DNA-level became an additional option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the dek gene on chromosome 6 and the can gene on chromosome 9 contain one specific intron where breakpoints of t(6;9) patients were found to cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The translocation results in a consistent chimeric dek-can <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which is generated from the 6p- derivative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five centers participated in a study to estimate the incidence of t(6;9) in leukemic patients using conventional Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 320) with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) were screened for rearrangement of the genes involved in this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these 320 patients showed rearrangement of the can gene on chromosome 9, of which one also had a rearranged dek gene on chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A further 20 patients were studied with karyotypic aberrations in which either the short arm of chromosome 6 or the long arm of chromosome 9 were specifically involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both conventional Southern blot analysis and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) analysis failed to show dek-can rearrangement in any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of our study indicate that the incidence of the t(6;9) is a low as reported based on cytogenetic data and that rearrangement of the dek and can genes is mainly restricted to this specific translocation </plain></SENT>
