<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>hCLP46 (3q13.33) contains 11 exons encoding a putative protein of 392 amino acids, with a highly conserved CAP10 domain, a hydrophobic signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at its N-terminus, and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal motif KTEL at the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The homologs of hCLP46 exist in different organisms from plants to animal kingdoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localization analysis showed that hCLP46 is an ER-resident protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hCLP46 expressed in most human adult tissues at different intensities, with lengths of 3.5 kb and 1.9 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcript of hCLP46 was not detectable in colon, thymus, and small intestine, but was abundant in liver, indicating that hCLP46 may be involved in important physiological functions in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hCLP46 over-expressed U937 cells had higher growth rate than the cells without exogenic hCLP46 protein expression, suggesting that hCLP46 protein possess the ability of promoting cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
