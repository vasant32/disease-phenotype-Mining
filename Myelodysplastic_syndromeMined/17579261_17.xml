<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we treated three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> with an anchor modified, HLA-A*2402 binding WT1 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which was emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was suppressed and clinical response was evaluated as stable disease by the RECIST criteria after 3 months of weekly immunizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, development of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> has stopped in these patients for a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No deleterious side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi>-specific T cells were expanded in PBMCs of the patients and a substantial fraction of them bore the surface phenotype consistent with a CD8+ cytotoxic effector population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> did not regress further, considering the component of the vaccine, i.e. <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> alone, the stabilization effect suggested the potential of WT1 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> to develop into a more effective vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of WT1 immunotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, the results will stimulate more extensive clinical studies </plain></SENT>
