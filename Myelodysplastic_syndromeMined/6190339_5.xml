<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Raised levels were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_338'>granulocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most striking elevation was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These raised serum levels are probably derived from increased cell turnover, and it is suggested that cells of monocyte-macrophage series are particularly high producers of beta 2-m </plain></SENT>
