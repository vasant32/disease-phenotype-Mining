<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed literature data on 6,306 cases of hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphatic and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> excepted), myelodysplastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>--with the goal of quantitatively ascertaining how often cytogenetically unrelated clones occur in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly wide variations were found: in ANLL, unrelated clones were present in 1.1% of the 2,506 known cases with chromosome abnormalities characterized with banding technique; in the various myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative (CMD) disorders (total number of cases 1,299) the frequency was 4.3% and in lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> 1.3% (total case number 2,501) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter group the proportions varied between 0.4% and 0.6% in ALL and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) to as much as 6.2% in CLD and 7.3% in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some karyotypic abnormalities were encountered more often than would be expected from their general frequency in the various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy was particularly evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CMD, where 5q- was found in slightly less and +8 in somewhat more than half of the 56 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these two aberrations were found as the only changes in the two coexisting clones in one-fourth of the material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although if viewed in isolation these data would undoubtedly be best explained by assuming a multicellular origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, it is entirely possible that what are cytogenetically perceived as unrelated clones could be subclones with some invisible aberration in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If so, this interpretation indicates that changes like +8 and 5q-, both of which are common rearrangements in bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, are actually secondary changes that develop during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
