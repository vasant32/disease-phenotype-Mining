<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The study population included 388 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> medical and dental charts were reviewed in a retrospective fashion to identify patients who received dental extractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dental disease</z:e> and intervention (extraction) were evaluated, and parameters such as days of hospitalization and survival rate were compared with those of the remainder population who did not receive dental extractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 388 patients, 69 underwent dental extractions and 9 had sequelae and complications after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting complication rate of 13% was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although some patients did experience delay of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant (BMT), or both, no significant difference was found in the number of days in the hospital for BMT and the survival rate for the patients with sequelae and complications (n = 9) and for the remainder population (n = 319) ( &gt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dental extraction intervention provided in the prechemotherapy and pre-BMT time frame did not have a negative bearing on medical outcome </plain></SENT>
