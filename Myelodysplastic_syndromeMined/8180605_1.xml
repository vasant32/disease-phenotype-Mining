<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, the NOVE regimen, was examined in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one previously untreated patients (eight females, thirteen males) with a median age of 56 years (range 28-67 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was made within the range of six months to three years before transformation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NOVE regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 10 mg/m2 day 1-5, and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 100 mg/m2 day 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After one single course of therapy eleven patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and three patients a partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (six in CR and three in PR) received a second course, and the PR was completed to a CR in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overall response rate was 66% (14/21 patients), and the CR rate was 57% (12/21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median duration of CR was 7 months (range 2-10 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 10 months (range 3-20 months) for complete responders and 3 months (range 1-10 months) for patients who did not achieve a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with subsequent CR, median time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> (&lt; 500/microliters) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (&lt; 20.000/microliters) was 20 days and 18 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the NOVE regimen appears to be effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, strategies for remission maintenance are warranted </plain></SENT>
