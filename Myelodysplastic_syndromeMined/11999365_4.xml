<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective survey in 62 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) centers in Japan in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HCTs performed between 1986 and 1998 were reviewed, and those involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donors were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-five patients who underwent allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) were studied for complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positivity for HBsAg was observed in 32 patients (24%) throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the 32 patients were HBsAg carriers before alloHCT, whereas the remaining 6 became HBsAg(+) after alloHCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two recipients were anti-HBs antibody (HBsAb)-positive, and 58 recipients (43%) were HCV Ab(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 26 (42%) HBsAg(+) recipients survived between &gt;4 and &gt;119 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 26 cases received transplants from HBsAg(+) donors, and, although they had not developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, 4 of 6 died of hepatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> within 10 months after HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, 5 patients showed serologic evidence of HBV reactivation, whereas 4 patients showed evidence of an immune response to HBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> reactivation occurred during the tapering of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 3 of 5 were alive at the time of this report, suggesting that reactivation is not directly correlated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (13%) of 135 recipients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight (47%) of 17 were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo> and 5 (29%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e> was observed in 12% of both HBsAg(+) and HCVAb(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study, the relatively high incidence of HBV events occurred after alloHCT, and, therefore, we should consider a protocol for active immunization of donors and recipients against HBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although the presence of HBV or HCV is not a contraindication for alloHCT, we recommend a careful follow-up of recipients after transplantation, especially during immunosuppression tapering </plain></SENT>
