<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen may be more suitable than standard conditioning regimens before allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we retrospectively compare the outcome of a treosulfan-based conditioning regimen with standard myeloablative TBI-based conditioning regimens in patients (pts) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 pts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were included in the study, of which 29 (60%) pts received TBI-based and 19 (40%) pts received a treosulfan-based conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower relapse incidence (5% vs 34% at 3 years, P=0.019) resulting in a better, but not statistically significant relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) (57% vs 31%, P=0.086) was observed after treosulfan-based conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pts with increased risk for significant side effects due to comorbidities (haematopoietic stem cell transplantation specific comorbidity index), the estimated 3-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was significantly better in the treosulfan group: 54% (95% confidence interval (CI), 17-90%) compared with pts in the TBI group: 11% (95% CI, 0-44%; log-rank test P=0.0455) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy is a feasible and effective regimen for pts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially in pts with preexisting comorbidities </plain></SENT>
