<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conclude that karyotype instability is part of the natural history of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> through a specific mutator effect, linked to lacking SBDS protein, with consequent clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anomalies of chromosomes</z:e> 7 and 20 in BM, which may eventually promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with the patients' ageing </plain></SENT>
