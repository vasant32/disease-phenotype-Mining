<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between treatment response and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AZA-001 data were analyzed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis with response as a time-varying covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response categories were Overall Response, which was defined as complete remission, partial remission, or any hematologic improvement; and "Stable Disease," defined as no complete or partial remission, hematologic improvement, or progression; or Other (e.g., disease progression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Achieving an Overall Response with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by 95% compared with achieving an Overall Response with the conventional care regimens (hazard ratio 0.05 [0.01-0.43], p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses indicated that significantly improved overall survival remained manifest for patients with a hematologic improvement who had never achieved complete or partial remission (hazard ratio 0.19 [0.08-0.46], p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stable Disease in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>-treated and conventional care-treated patients was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 0.09, [0.06&amp;-0.15]; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> benefit on overall survival compared with conventional care regimens in patients with higher-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> who achieve hematologic response but never attain complete or partial remission, in addition to the survival advantage conferred by achievement of complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00071799) </plain></SENT>
