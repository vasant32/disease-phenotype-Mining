<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of sex chromosome losses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e>, comparing the characteristics between patients with sole and secondary sex chromosome losses in conjunction with other chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study group included 868 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> between June 1998 and May 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells of bone marrow aspirates were processed using unstimulated culture methods such as direct, 24-hr and/or 48-hr culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex chromosome losses were included in the karyotype, when X or Y chromosome loss is observed in more than 2 metaphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sex chromosome losses in bone marrow were found in 5.1% of the patients and 1.8% showed sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the disease categories, the incidences of sex chromosome losses were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 9.5%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 0%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 6.0%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> 3.6%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 1.3%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), 13.0%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 0%; malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3.8%; and benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male and median age was higher than that of patients with sex chromosome losses as a secondary abnormality (64 vs. 58 yr, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of metaphase cells with sex chromosome losses was significantly lower in patients with sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality (40% vs. 100%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes of sex chromosome loss were correlated with the disease status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that secondary sex chromosome losses in conjunction with other chromosomal abnormalities seem to be one of the clonal abnormalities, whereas sex chromosome losses as a sole change seem to be an aging phenomenon, but further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
