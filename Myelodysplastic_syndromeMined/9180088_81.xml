<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of malignant myeloid disorders in young children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 is 200 to 500 times the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 (NF1) encodes neurofibromin, a protein that negatively regulates signals transduced by Ras proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that NF1 functions as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells, but inactivation of both NF1 alleles has not been demonstrated in leukemic cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an in vitro transcription and translation system, we screened bone marrow samples from 18 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 and myeloid disorders for NF1 mutations that cause a truncated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the patients, and from their affected parents, in cases of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specimens from 9 of the 18 children contained abnormal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragments, and truncating mutations of the NF1 gene were found in specimens from 8 of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NF1 allele was absent in bone marrow samples from five of the eight children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected the same mutation in DNA from the affected parent of each child with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both alleles of the NF1 gene are inactivated in leukemic cells in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NF1 appears to function as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
