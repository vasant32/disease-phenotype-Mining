<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study analyzing the 409 patients referred to the M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Service in 1995 in whom a bone marrow examination was performed by the referring physician and in whom this examination was repeated at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed 100 cases, including 84 of the 409 referred patients for whom the diagnostic outside bone marrow slide had been sent for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall concordance rate was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 18% discordances were present and considered of major importance (affecting treatment and/or prognosis) while in 9% there were minor discordances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major discordance rates were 2% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, but 29% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (79 patients), 43% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (7 patients), 19% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (42 patients), 57% for hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (7 patients), and 23% for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (75 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate was 76% in the 100 cases in which bone marrow specimens permitted comparison of the morphologic diagnosis made by M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anderson and the referring physician using the same slide, with a rate of 75% in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> as finally diagnosed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although in the majority of cases the referring physicians and the specialty service agreed on diagnosis, major discordance occurs in a significant number of cases, including highly treatable diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> promyelocystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
