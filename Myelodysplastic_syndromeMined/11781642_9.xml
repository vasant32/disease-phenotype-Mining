<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received an identical conditioning regimen which consisted of in vivoCAMPATH-1H 20 mg over 5 days, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 120 mg/kg and 14.4 Gy TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean T cell dose administered was 0.02 +/- 0.05 x 10(6)/kg for group A and 2.8 +/- 2.8 10(6)/kg for group B (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 28 months overall survival was 36.4% for group A at 12 months compared to 78.3% for group B (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality in group A at 12 months was 63.6% as compared to 18.0% in group B (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in group A occurred secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that extensive in vitro T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of peripheral blood stem cells in combination with in vivo T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may have profound effects upon the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> following allogeneic stem cell transplantation and this may adversely effect transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
