<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the function and proliferation of natural killer cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-cell receptor gammadelta T cells are other important components of innate immunity that have been recently implicated in the immune response against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the phenotype, function, and in vitro expansion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patient-derived gammadelta T cells in response to interleukin-2 and bromohalohydrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi>, a synthetic phosphoantigen with a potent T-cell receptor gammadelta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> effect that specifically activates and amplifies this T-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, the major circulating gammadelta T-cell subset, were reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, but mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>' patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, suggesting that this anomaly was largely due to the autoimmune component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, bromohalohydrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi>-induced expansion of the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell population in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 control samples, but in only 26 of 43 (60%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to bromohalohydrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> was independent of World Health Organization subtype, cytogenetic findings and International Prognostic Scoring System score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In responding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients, expanded Vgamma 9Vdelta2 T cells exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytolytic and secretory activity against leukemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> cell lines; fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that these Vgamma 9Vdelta2 T cells were not derived from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these Vgamma 9Vdelta2 T cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had limited proliferative capacity in response to interleukin-2 despite having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of interleukin-2 receptor chains (alpha beta gamma ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results, combined with our previous findings concerning natural killer cells, suggest that there are immune surveillance defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
