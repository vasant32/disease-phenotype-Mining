<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We describe the cytogenetic results of 93 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main object of this report is to analyze the prognostic value of the karyotype in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in relation to the evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and the survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic studies were performed in 93 untreated cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> between 1985 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and the evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 93 patients who were examined at the time of diagnosis, 40 had an abnormal karyotype (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency of chromosome abnormalities was observed in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) (65.7%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) (40%) and the lowest in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes most frequently involved were: 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between FAB subtypes and the type of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In respect to the prognosis, an abnormal karyotype, and a complex karyotype were related with a higher frequency of evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A model based on karyotype could divide patients in two groups: poor prognosis (patients with an abnormal karyotype, with involvement of chromosome 7, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or with a complex karyotype), and a good prognosis (patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cytogenetic studies are very useful in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for their clinical implications </plain></SENT>
