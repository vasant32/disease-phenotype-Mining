<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Once-weekly dosing of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has not been investigated thoroughly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of this new dosing regimen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were unresponsive to the conventional three-times-weekly schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with low- or intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled in a 12-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rhEPO alpha (rhEPOalpha) was administered once-weekly by subcutaneous injection with a starting dose of 40,000 U fixed dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug dosage was increased to 60,000 U fixed dose if after 6 weeks there was no or suboptimal erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically significant responses were seen in 13 (27%) patients, with 11 improving their response after dose escalation of rhEPOalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (case 23) maintains a response after a follow-up period of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients had responses lasting between 10 and 43 weeks, with a median time to relapse of 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated, with no relevant adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy was associated with significantly higher concentrations of circulating erythroid blast-forming units and a decrease of the bone marrow fraction of apoptic CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly rhEPOalpha therapy results in an improvement of erythropoiesis in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who are unresponsive to conventional dosing, and may act by inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigation of this dosing regimen either alone or in combination with other agents </plain></SENT>
