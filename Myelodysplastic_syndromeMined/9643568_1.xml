<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The major vault lung resistance protein LRP is a cytoplasmic protein involved in drug resistance, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for LRP overexpression, using immunocytochemistry with LRP 56 monoclonal antibody, on marrow slides from 41 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LRP overexpression (LRP+) was defined by expression of LRP 56 in at least 20% of marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LRP overexpression was seen in 19 (46%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concordant results between LRP overexpression and P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (PGP) expression were seen in 66% of the cases (p = 0.03), and discordant results (LRP+ and PGP-, or LRP- and PGP+) in 33% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was seen between LRP overexpression and FAB type, karyotype, CD34, p53 expression and bcl2 overexpression in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the 18 cases treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-AraC intensive chemotherapy and the 7 cases treated with low dose AraC, the response rate was not significantly different in LRP+ and LRP- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was also similar in LRP+ and LRP- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LRP overexpression is probably more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, is only partially correlated with PGP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our experience, however, LRP was not a prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy and survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
