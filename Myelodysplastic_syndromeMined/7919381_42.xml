<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Structural alterations occur in the long arm of chromosome 3 in approximately 2% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major alterations are inv(3)(q21q26) and t(3:3)(q21;q26) and are often classified as the 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the EVI1 gene is transcriptionally activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> with t(3;3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26) and that the chromosomal breakpoints at 3q26 in the translocations were 5' of the EVI1 gene, whereas the breakpoints in the inversion cases were 3' of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these studies, four additional cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with inv(3)(q21q26) are shown to express the EVI1 gene and to have breakpoints 3' of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To characterize the 3q21 breakpoint region, cosmid and phage clones were isolated that cover approximately 100 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3q21, the breakpoints for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> with t(3;3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26) were found to cluster over a region of approximately 50 kb downstream of the Ribophorin I gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate a common mechanism for the translocations and inversions and support the hypothesis that the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 gene is mediated by enhancer elements associated with the Ribophorin I gene </plain></SENT>
