<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pharmacokinetic and clinical pilot study of high-dose intermittent ubenimex was performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ubenimex (150 mg/body) was administered orally, twice per day (at a 3 hr interval), twice a week, for at least 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of ubenimex and p-OH ubenimex, another active metabolite, increased gradually up to 7.1 +/- 4.7 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD) at 5 hr and 0.25 +/- 0.15 mu/ml at 6 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low percentage (4.2%) of the AUC ratio (p-OH ubenimex/ubenimex) suggested minimal metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma half-life of ubenimex was 2.1 +/- 0.7 hr and the total urinary recovery of both was 71.4% in 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 8 patients clinically studied, one achieved good response and another achieved minor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested good bioavailability, and a certain effectiveness of ubenimex in this administration method, which was worth trying, at least in restricted cases, such as cases with refractory disease or with a poor performance status </plain></SENT>
