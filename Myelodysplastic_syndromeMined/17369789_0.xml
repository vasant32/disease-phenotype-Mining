<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When it happens, it is typical to find masses around the brain and pachymeningeal thickening, but it is very rare to find it associated with subdural haemorrhage, as in the case we describe in the present article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering our case and the literature we can suggest that radiological images associated with the clinical history of the patient suggestive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> can be sufficient for a correct diagnosis and for a radiotherapy treatment, demanding surgery in the case of diagnostic doubts, massive hemorrahages or neurological decifits caused by the focal lesions </plain></SENT>
