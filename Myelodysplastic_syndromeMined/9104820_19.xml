<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, mutations arise predominantly at the N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a fundamental role for this oncogene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, despite its obvious significance, little is known of how this key oncogene may subvert the process of hematopoiesis in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using CD34+ progenitor cells, we have modeled the preleukemic state by infecting these cells with amphotropic retrovirus expressing mutant N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> together with the selectable marker gene lacZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase, allows direct identification and study of N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-expressing cells by incubating infected cultures with a fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase, which gives rise to a fluorescent signal within the infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using multiparameter flow cytometry, we have studied the ability of CD34+ cells expressing mutant N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> to undergo erythroid differentiation induced by erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By this means, we have found that erythroid progenitor cells expressing mutant N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> exhibit a proliferative defect resulting in an increased cell doubling time and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S + G2M phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is linked to a slowing in the rate of differentiation as determined by comparative cell-surface marker analysis and ultimate failure of the differentiation program at the late-erythroblast stage of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dyserythropoiesis was also linked to an increased tendency of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-expressing cells to undergo programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during their differentiation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This erythroid lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> recapitulates one of the most common features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and for the first time provides a causative link between mutational activation of N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
