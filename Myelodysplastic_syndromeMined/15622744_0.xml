<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The methylation rate of calcitonin gene (CTMR) in the genomic DNA extracted from bone marrow cell of 27 MDS patients and 6 AML patients with antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied by PCR amplification of Hpa I digested DNA, with external reference of undigested and Msp I digested DNA and internal reference of 112bp fragment containing N-ras-61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intensity of silver-stained PCR products was measured by densitometer and analysed using the computer program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CTMR was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (33.65% +/- 23.37%) than in control group (P&lt;0.001), in 9 RAEB(T) (58.35% +/- 17.44%) than in the control and RA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five RA patients who have survived three to ten years without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CTMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of 8 RAEB(T) patients who had a high CTMR of more than 30% evolved into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTMR might be a useful marker for predicting the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
