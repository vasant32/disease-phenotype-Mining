<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As probes, we used Alu-polymerase chain reaction products from 22 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that span chromosome bands 7q21.1-q32, including representative clones from a panel of YACs recognizing a contiguous genomic DNA fragment of 5 to 6 Mb in band 7q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 19 cases with deletions, we identified two distinct commonly deleted regions: one region within band 7q22 was defined by the two <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases; the second region encompassed a distal part of band 7q22 and the entire band 7q31 and was defined by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of one of the reciprocal translocations was mapped to 7q21.3, which is centromeric to both of the commonly deleted regions </plain></SENT>
