<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, comparative morphometry using both methods was performed on marrow biopsies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, and of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphometric results in the present study showed that precise megakaryocyte size can be calculated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic bone marrow sections by using HE stain if one employs stereological corrections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, megakaryocyte numbers can be more precisely detected by immunohistochemistry than by HE stain, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiation disturbances and ineffective megakaryocytopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were demonstrated by immunomorphometric analyses </plain></SENT>
