<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, less is known about the significance of this process in the bone marrow of HIV-positive patients with myelodysplastic features (MDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Trephines from 22 HIV-positive haemophilic patients were immunostained for CD34 antigen, and the microvessel density (MVD) was quantitatively evaluated and compared with that of 21 biopsies from patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and with that of 12 control bone marrows with no evidence of marrow disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow MVD in HIV-positive haemophilic patients was similar to that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; however, both groups revealed significantly higher MVD counts than those of control bone marrows (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean MVD counts of HIV-positive haemophilic patients were significantly associated with HIV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no correlation was found between MVD and clinical HIV stage or CD4 counts at the time of biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a direct involvement of HIV in the pathogenesis of MDF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in HIV-positive patients may provide further insights into the pathobiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
