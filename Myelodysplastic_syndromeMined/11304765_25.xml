<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: At transplantation, 56 patients had treatment-related secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 15 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), 23 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 15 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens were total-body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy for 60 patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (BU) 14 to 16 mg/kg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) 120 mg/kg (BUCY) for 27 patients, BU targeted to 600 to 900 ng/mL plasma steady-state concentration with 120 mg/kg CY (BUCY-t) for 22 patients, and miscellaneous chemotherapy for two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donors were HLA-identical or partially identical family members for 69 patients and unrelated donors for 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival was 8% for TBI, 19% for BUCY, and 30% for BUCY-t (P =.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 40% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, 40% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 26% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and 0% for RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (P =.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality after TBI was 58%; after BUCY, 52%; and after BUCY-t, 42% (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients at risk for treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> should be followed closely and be considered for stem-cell transplantation early in the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> using conditioning regimens such as BUCY-t designed to reduce nonrelapse mortality </plain></SENT>
