<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 15), growth values in the 22 patients (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) were significantly reduced for CFU-GEMM (0.4 +/- 0.1 versus 7 +/- 1, P less than 0.0005), CFU-Mk (1.4 +/- 0.5 versus 18 +/- 4, P less than 0.0005), BFU-E (2.2 +/- versus 40 +/- 6, P less than 0.0005), and CFU-GM (19 +/- 5 versus 65 +/- 10, P less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The growth of CFU-GEMM was abnormal at an early stage in the clinical development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, sometimes even when CFU-GM formation was still <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colony-formation was unaffected by removal of hematopoietic accessory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no correlation was found between the incidence of lineage-restricted progenitors and the degree of peripheral cytopenia, derangement of colony growth was more pronounced in patients with worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (i) the grossly defective CFU-GEMM growth supports the concept of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as clonal disorders of hematopoietic multipotent stem cells; (ii) a progressive impairment of in vitro hematopoiesis occurs in association with the clinical progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
