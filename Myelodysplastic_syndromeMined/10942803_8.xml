<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 34 patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> pigmentosa or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> were investigated by cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up investigation was performed in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clones with chromosome abnormalities were found in 32% of the patients at the first examination and in 27% at the second examination; in total, 41% of the patients had an abnormal clone in at least one examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clinical correlation was found with regard to cytogenetic results, with the exception of four patients who had an associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second examination, only 6 patients had an unchanged chromosome pattern, and 4 of the patients with an initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern had appearance of abnormal clones; however, in 7 patients, the initial abnormal cells disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were, among others, deletions of chromosomes 5, 7, 11, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cells with structural or numerical chromosome changes was higher in comparison with reported control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency and type of chromosome abnormalities in bone marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> was about the same as observed in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, diseases which also developed in 4 of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An association between malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> have been suggested by us and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The chromosome abnormalities maybe reflect a genetic instability of the hematopoietic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
