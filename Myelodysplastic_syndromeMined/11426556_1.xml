<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aminothiol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> has shown to promote multilineage hematopoiesis both in vivo and in vitro in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have treated 10 patients with 250 mg/m2 amifostine thrice weekly in combination with erythropoietin for 4 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responding patients received the same 6 week schedule, while nonresponder received G-CSF in addition to erythropoietin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> during the second treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced single or multilineage hematologic improvement, but only 2 reached transfusion independency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, response was durable only in a minority of patients and thus additional studies are warranted to further define the potential interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and growth factors </plain></SENT>
