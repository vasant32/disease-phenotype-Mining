<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 9-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, who urgently underwent bone marrow transplantation from his NIMA-complementary HLA two-locus-mismatched sister following graft failure of cord blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was successfully confirmed and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After withdrawal of tacrolimus to prevent recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> approximately 6 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His clinical symptoms were resolved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy, but he subsequently progressed to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and truncal <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pleural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> contained numerous lymphocytes, which gradually subsided with continuous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His symptoms were thereafter controlled by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) administration, and his current performance status is almost perfect by the administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (5 mg/day) and MMF at 6 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although multiple serositis associated with GVHD is known to have a poor prognosis, the multiple symptoms of this patient improved gradually, probably owing to a lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and the effect of MMF </plain></SENT>
