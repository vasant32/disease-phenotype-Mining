<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of NF1 mutation was reported to be rare in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), there have been no previous reports on its configuration in patients showing the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined NF1 in 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> including 9 who had progressed to more advanced stages and 16 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had an Nras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We carried out allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA) to detect a mutation at the first nucleotide A of codon 1423 (AAG), a mutational hot spot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also employed a polymerase chain reaction mediated single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method to confirm the result of ASRA and to detect a point mutation in other sequences of FLR exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In consequence, ASRA disclosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> configuration and PCR-SSCP showed no aberrant band in any sample examined whether the samples harboured an Nras mutation or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NF1 mutation does not play a crucial role in the development and the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
