<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is especially true in patients at high risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to high intensity chemotherapy for relapse or to higher age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to reduce the phase of risk we administered human recombinant GM-CSF to 23 patients at a median age of 65 (range 17-84) years including 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 5 lymphoblastic (ALL) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after early or second relapses and 10 patients of 65 years and older in primary induction treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had prior bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 AML's were secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> chemotherapy (2) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was part of chemotherapeutic phase II and III studies using TAD9 for primary induction chemotherapy and S-HAM for relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Starting on day 4 after the end of intensive CT GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/day was given by continuous i.v. infusion and after recovery of neutrophils was deescalated in two 4 day steps and discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12/23 patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and median age of responders is 61 (range 17-84) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group of the non-transplanted patients the median recovery time of neutrophils is reduced by one week when compared to controls receiving the same chemotherapy (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed a leukemic regrowth in 3 patients of 61, 70, and 78 years, 2 of whom having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of GM-CSF the regrowth of blasts was reversible in 1 patient and continued unaffectedly in its kinetics in 2 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
