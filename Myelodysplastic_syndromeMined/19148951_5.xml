<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report a prospective study of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (SL)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (NB) patients treated with &gt; or =5 cycles of dose-intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: NB patients received induction with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (4,200 mg/m(2))-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (75 mg/m(2))-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), and high-dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (200 mg/m(2))-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (600 mg/m(2)) (cycles 3, 5, 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was examined every 1-3 months for &gt; or =36 months, with inclusion of extensive chromosomal studies 1-3 months post-induction and 1-2x/year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eight four patients received 5 (n = 76), 6 (n = 45), 7 (n = 59), or 8 (n = 4) cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed SL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (only one each in the 5- and 6-cycle groups), at 12-50 months, including two cases detected in surveillance studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 108 patients who received &gt; or =6 cycles, the 5-year cumulative incidence was 7.1% (95% CI: 2%, 12.2%), versus 0% among 54 patients who received 5 cycles without maintenance oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative incidences were 1.46%, 2.28%, and 8.47% among patients in the 5-, 6-, and 7-cycle groups, with fewer cycles having a significantly lower risk (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association of risk with potentially leukemogenic consolidative treatments (targeted radiotherapy, myeloablative therapy, and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of dose-intensive cycles significantly decreases the risk of SL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, yielding 5-year rates matching the low range (0.4-2.2%) reported for moderate-dose combination chemotherapy regimens used against other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
