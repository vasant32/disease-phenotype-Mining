<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were abstracted from hospital records of 108 patients who died - 27 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 48 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 22 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients (86.1%) were &gt;60 years of age at diagnosis, with 33 (30.6%) being &gt;or=80 years and 31 (28.7%) having existing comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (30.6%) were referred to SPC services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was little difference by age or HM diagnosis in referred patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 67 patients (25.4%) dying on a hospital ward received SPC compared with 6/7 (85.7%) dying at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time between diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> influenced the referral - 24/52 patients (46.2%) dying &gt;or=30 days after diagnosis received SPC compared with 8/42 (19.1%) dying within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, HM diagnosis was confirmed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of these 14 patients is likely to be a unique feature of our study, as patients were selected from a regional, population-based register with centralized diagnostic services, enabling the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with HM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interface between curative and palliative treatment in HM is more complex than the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommendations suggest </plain></SENT>
