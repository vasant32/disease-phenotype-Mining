<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the proliferative capacity and apoptotic propensity of CD34+ progenitor cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients excluding accessory cell interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD34+/CD3-/CD19- cells of 5 MDS patients and 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM were sorted as single cells into single wells and were cultured in liquid medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wells were evaluated on days 4, 7, 10, and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCD was determined by staining with annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Growth rate and cell doubling time (Td) were calculated for each colony-forming cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> BM CD34+ cells formed clusters and colonies and both showed increasing PCD in time, although within colonies the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was twice as high (about 25%) as compared with clusters at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increased cluster formation was observed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluation points when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM, whereas the number of colonies was markedly reduced (1/7 of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These colonies were also smaller, usually smaller than 100 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly enhanced levels of PCD of clusters (53-79%) in combination with longer cell doubling times explain this slower formation of smaller colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, these colonies showed considerably lower levels of PCD (7-32%) as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (1-48%, median values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of stromal influences and accessory cells, this study in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed intrinsically enhanced proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cluster-forming cells, as the opposite was true for colony-forming cells </plain></SENT>
