<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1071 patients were enrolled in 7 studies: 995 with relapsed/refractory low-grade NHL, +/- transformation (median, 3 prior regimens [range, 1-13 regimens]) and 76 patients with previously untreated low-grade follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single dose of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> tositumomab and I(131) tositumomab was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For tMDS/tAML patients, baseline and posttherapy peripheral blood and marrow specimens were reviewed in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6 years from diagnosis and 2 years from radioimmunotherapy (RIT) for previously treated patients, and 4.6 years from radioimmunotherapy for previously untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>tMDS/tAML was reported in 35 (3.5%) of 995 patients (annualized incidence, 1.6%/y [95% confidence interval, 1.0%-2.0%/y]), and 52% of the tMDS/tAML diagnoses of tMDS/tAML were confirmed in a blinded review (annualized incidence of 1.1%/y [95% confidence interval, 0.7%-1.6%/y]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 cases, 10 patients (40%) were diagnosed with tMDS/tAML prior to receiving radioimmunotherapy; 2 (8%) had no pathologic or clinical evidence to support such a diagnosis; and 13 (52%) were confirmed to have developed tMDS/tAML following RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This incidence is consistent with that expected on the basis of patients' prior chemotherapy for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up approaching 5 years, no case of tMDS/tAML has been reported in any of the 76 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I(131) tositumomab as their initial therapy (P = .011 compared with previously treated patients) </plain></SENT>
