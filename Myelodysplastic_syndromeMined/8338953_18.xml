<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared conventional banding techniques and FISH for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (+8) in 89 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 21 had -7, 30 had +8, four had both, and 34 had no aberrations or aberrations other than -7 or +8 as assessed by banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential samples were available in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alphoid DNA probes specific for chromosomes no. 7 and 8 were used for FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As controls, 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (BM) samples were hybridized with the chromosomes no. 7 and 8 probes, and in addition <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were hybridized with a chromosome no. 1 specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value for -7 was 18% one-spot cells, and for +8 was 3% three-spot cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of 44 samples with -7 or +8, and at least 10 metaphases evaluated, showed that the proportions of aberrant metaphase cells mirrored the interphase clone sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most samples with nonclonal metaphase aberrations, including those with only a few metaphases, had increased numbers of aberrant interphase cells: 20% to 80% for -7, and 3% to 43% for +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interphase cytogenetics of the 34 samples without -7 or +8 did not show significant cell populations with -7 or +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four patients, -7 or +8 could not be confirmed by FISH due to additional structural aberrations, marker chromosomes, or wrongly interpreted banding results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As FISH will be used more and more in cytogenetic diagnosis, clinical follow-up, and therapy monitoring, it will be necessary to standardize FISH procedures and supplement the Standing Committee on Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) definitions of a clone with criteria specifically for in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
