<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (4.3%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> studied cytogenetically at our institution over a period of 11 years had detectable 17p deletion, through <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 (14 cases) or rearrangements of chromosome 17 (generally unbalanced translocations between 17p and another chromosome) (35 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had additional complex cytogenetic findings, and 10 cases were therapy related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 70% of the patients with 17p deletion, a particular type of dysgranulopoïesis, combining pseudo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pelger-Huët anomaly</z:e> and small vacuolated neutrophils was seen in &gt; 5% marrow neutrophils, whereas 69% of the patients had a p53 mutation, generally in a missense mutation involving exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis, performed in eight cases, confirmed loss of one P53 allele in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No DNA fragmentation suggesting <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> was found in marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to chemotherapy was almost uniformly poor and median survival was only 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of dysgranulopoïesis and p53 mutations were also made in 'control' groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without 17p deletion.

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 3.1% of 256 MDS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without 17p deletion had a p53 mutation (P = 10(-4) with patients having 17p deletion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that 17p deletion, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, is strongly correlated to the presence of a particular type of dysgranulopoïesis and to a high incidence of p53 mutations, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with 17p deletion could constitute a new morphological-cytogenetic-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23367">molecular entity</z:chebi> in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
