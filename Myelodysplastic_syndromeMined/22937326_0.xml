<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient transfusion independency was observed after 4 treatment cycles; in one case a partial response was recorded, but a progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) after 13 AZA cycles has appeared </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Future studies are mandatory for evaluation of new molecular and clinical features which could predict the efficiency of hypomethylating agents in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> therapy with respect to overall survival, event-free survival, quality-adjusted life year, and pharmacoeconomy </plain></SENT>
