<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (T-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed t(7;11)(p15;p15), which has been rarely reported but known to be characteristic of Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although t(7;11)(p15;p15) has been reported mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), it can be occasionally found in so-called stem cell diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, t(7;11)(p15;p15) might affect trilineage progenitors or stem cells as well as myeloid lineage cells, subsequently resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with T-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as in our case reported here </plain></SENT>
