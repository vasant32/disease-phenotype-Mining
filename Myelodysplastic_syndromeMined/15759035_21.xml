<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better define the clinical and cytogenetic features in Chinese patients, a retrospective multicentric study was performed in 508 MDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with Western countries, Chinese patients showed younger age (median: 49 vs 65-73 years), lower percentages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (2.8 vs 6.6-15.3%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (5.2 vs 11.7-30.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, among 367 cases with evaluable data, abnormal karyotypes were found in 136 cases, including 56 numerical and 80 structural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidences of single chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were lower than those in Western countries (2.2 vs 17.8-42.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, complex cytogenetic aberrations and chromosome translocations were frequently observed and related to poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both multiple chromosome deletions and translocations were detected in advanced subtypes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
