<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> of mice lacking the Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing 5' phosphoinositol phosphatase, SHIP, underscores the need for closely regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activity, and hence levels of phosphatidylinositol species during hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the 3' phosphoinositol phosphatase Pten in this process is less clear, as its absence leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite Pten heterozygosity being associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, we found no evidence of a hematopoietic defect in Pten(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since SHIP shares the same substrate (PIP(3)) with Pten, we hypothesized that the former might compensate for Pten haploinsufficiency in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we examined the effect of Pten heterozygosity in SHIP(-/-) mice, predicting that further dysregulation of PIP(3) metabolism would exacerbate the pheno-type of the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, compared with SHIP(-/-) mice, Pten(+/-)SHIP(-/-) animals developed a myelodysplastic phenotype characterized by increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a marrow defect, clonogenic assays demonstrated reductions in committed myeloid and megakaryocytic progenitors in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Providing further evidence of a Pten(+/-)SHIP(-/-) progenitor abnormality, reconstitution of irradiated mice with marrows from these mice led to a marked defect in short-term repopulation of peripheral blood by donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that the regulation of the levels and/or ratios of PI3K-derived phosphoinositol species by these 2 phosphatases is critical to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
