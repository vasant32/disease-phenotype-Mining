<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of pancreatic ultrasonography in diagnosing Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diagnostic methods in two infants with SBDS were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient 1 first presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> in the early infantile period, and later developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>frequent infections</z:hpo> and elevated liver function tests without any haematological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients were considered to have impaired exocrine pancreatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasonography (US) obtained at 9 mo for patient 1 and at 10 mo for patient 2 showed diffuse high echogenicity, which raised suspicions of SBDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SBDS gene analysis confirmed SBDS in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pancreatic US is sensitive in detecting pathological change in SBDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be applied to the diagnostic approach for patients who show only minor signs of SBDS </plain></SENT>
