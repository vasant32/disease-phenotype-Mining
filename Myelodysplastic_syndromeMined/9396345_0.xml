<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The function of neutrophil can be evaluated by measuring oxidative metabolism using chemiluminescence, tetrazolium dye reduction or the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those results are not always satisfactory which would be caused by subtle difference in each preparation of the reagents and the lack of reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, flow cytometric procedures for semi-quantitating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in neutrophils have been developed to evaluate their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure, which requires only small amount of whole blood, can easily and rapidly yield reproducible and reliable data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we optimized analytical conditions and then determined reference interval to evaluate neutrophil function of patients with various disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optimal concentrations and incubation times of DCFH-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> were 5 mumol/l for 15 minutes and 25 micrograms/ml for 20 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in neutrophil was represented by relative fluorescence intensity(RFI) with assay coefficient of variance(CV) of 4.0-11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils had to be examined within 2 hours after venipuncture to obtain reliable data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reference interval was determined as 170.4 +/- 58.7(mean +/- SD) RFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil function of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>(SLE), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398595" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myeloperoxidase deficiency</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were within the reference interval as evaluated by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only neutrophils of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granulomatous disease</z:e>, which is known to give clearly low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, showed actually decreased value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this procedure would be clinically useful for diagnosis of patient with impaired neutrophil function </plain></SENT>
