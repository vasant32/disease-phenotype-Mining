<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These aberrations have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB subtypes with the exception of M3, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in megakaryoblastic crisis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the biological and clinical features of 10 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with inv(3)(q21q26) and t(3;3)(q21;q26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Four hundred and sixteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were studied in our Institute by cytogenetic analysis and 10 (2.4%) showed inv(3)(q21q26) (7 patients) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) (3 patients): 7 males, 3 females; median age, 43.5 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also used RT-PCR to investigate the pattern of expression of the EVI-1 gene in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Additional chromosomal changes were demonstrated in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5/10 cases a preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible occupational exposure was established in 2 patients (a farmer and an histologist employing organic solvents) and another patient had a therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtype was M1 in 9 patients and M2 in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A variable excess of micromegakaryocytes was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients the platelet count was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased (median number: 172 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5x10(9)/L; range 55-440) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of EVI-1 gene was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 5 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical course and outcome was extremely poor: 9/10 patients were resistant and 1 patient showed a partial remission after induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the 9 patients resistant to the first line chemotherapy, 7 were also resistant to the second line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Three patients obtained a morphologic complete remission after third line chemotherapy (duration 1, 3 and 6 months); 2 of them were submitted to autologous bone marrow transplantation, but relapsed after 1 and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 5.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings evidence a strong correlation between 3q21q26 chromosomal aberrations, abnormalities of megakaryocytopoiesis and lack of response to conventional chemotherapy and support the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of chromosome characterization in the classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
