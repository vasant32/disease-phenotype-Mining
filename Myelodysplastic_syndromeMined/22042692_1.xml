<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of an RD/1AG-MM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> donor was significantly associated with a higher overall mortality rate than the use of an 8/8-MUD in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.49; P &lt; .001), and this impact was statistically significant only in patients with standard-risk diseases (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among patients with standard-risk diseases who received transplantation from an RD/1AG-MM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> donor, the presence of an HLA-B Ag mismatch was significantly associated with a lower overall survival rate than an HLA-DR Ag mismatch because of an increased risk of treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLA-C Ag mismatch or multiple allelic mismatches were frequently observed in the HLA-B Ag-mismatched group, and were possibly associated with the poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an 8/8-MUD should be prioritized over an RD/1AG-MM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> donor during donor selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, an HLA-B Ag mismatch in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> direction has an adverse effect on overall survival and treatment-related mortality in patients with standard-risk diseases </plain></SENT>
