<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hybridization to human metaphases produces color banding patterns specific for each homologous chromosome pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique has been evaluated in a complementary manner with G-banding and chromosome painting in a series of 10 myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with complex or unresolved karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color banding detected the majority of chromosomal abnormalities, which had been identified by G-banding and in each case revealed chromosomal changes that G-banding had not identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Painting was necessary to confirm these abnormalities due to the limitation of only seven colors in the color-banded karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, painting fortuitously uncovered cryptic abnormalities in 6 of 10 cases that had not been detected by color banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insertions were visible by painting only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has demonstrated that in the analysis of complex karyotypes, the application of color banding revealed the involvement of the long arm of chromosome 3, indicating a poor risk, in two cases not identified by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these techniques applied together have revealed cryptic chromosomal abnormalities with prognostic significance, which in some cases may have implications for patient management </plain></SENT>
