<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: According to the recently published WHO-classification <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> with ringed sideroblasts (ET/RS) remains an ambiguous category which may be considered as myelodysplastic/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>, unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because until now only case reports or very small series of patients have been described, a more systematically performed study is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was carried out on 38 patients with the diagnosis of ET/RS and more than 15 % ringed sideroblasts on smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously performed bone marrow biopsies, follow-up examinations and survival data were also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on cytological features and particular bone marrow findings including immunohistochemistry three patterns could be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were associated with different clinical features and in particular prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I included six patients whose diagnosis was consistent with ET, group II comprised 21 patients revealing prefibrotic and early fibrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (CIMF) and finally 11 patients (group III) displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies revealed that no patient with ET showed a fiber increase but eight CIMF patients developed overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and four patients of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with a control group of 39 patients with true ET, prognosis was significantly different because our cohort showed a median survival of 100 months that contrasted significantly with the 170 months in the patients with true ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Ringed sideroblasts are not a pathognomonic feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but may indicate a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> probably associated with a primary or secondary disturbance of iron metabolism in a variety of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For this reason, a more accurate classification of so-called ET/RS patients is warranted by evaluation of smears and in particular bone marrow biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to our findings these patients should be classified as having either ET, CIMF or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and show a significantly different survival pattern </plain></SENT>
