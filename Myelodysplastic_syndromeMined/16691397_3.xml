<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case-control study was conducted during the period 2000-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 80 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 160 sex- and age-matched hospital controls with nonmalignant and noninfectious diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease categories in the control group were circulatory (51 patients, 32%), gastrointestinal (53 patients, 33%), and ophthalmological (56 patients, 35%) disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the following factors to be significantly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: exposure to chemicals (OR = 10.8, 95%CI 3.2-36.2, p = 0.0001), <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002788'>upper respiratory tract infections</z:hpo> (twice a year or more, OR = 5.8, 95%CI 2.5-13.6, p = 0.0001), exposure to <z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">insecticides</z:chebi>, pesticides and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi> (OR = 5.2, 95%CI 1.8-15.1, p = 0.003), coffee (OR = 5.1, 95%CI 1.9-13.7, p = 0.001), and alcohol consumption (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.6, p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
