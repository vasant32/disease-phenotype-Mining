<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) shows excessive intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, particularly in S-phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the light of previous reports that showed a link between experimental overexpression of the E2F1 transcription factor and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the S phase, we compared the status of E2F1 protein in bone marrow mononuclear cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with that of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly 67% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow samples showed higher expression of E2F1 transcription factor than in healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene product, Rb, is a major negative regulator of E2F1 activity; however, Rb protein levels were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplification of genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed no E2F1 gene amplification or mutation in the Rb-binding region of E2F1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, nor was transcriptional up-regulation noted when E2F1 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) levels were estimated with real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the overexpression of E2F1 was paralleled by its increased transcriptional activity, as reflected by the increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for one of its target genes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in a subset of the studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients for whom a simultaneous measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in S-phase cells was possible, the E2F1 protein levels showed a significant positive correlation with this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previously, increased E2F1 activity in human disease had been found primarily as a consequence of Rb derailment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, the observation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of increased E2F1 activity in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Rb levels is novel and unique, and E2F1 activity in association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in S-phase cells may thus have significant therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
