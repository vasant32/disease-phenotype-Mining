<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique in the detection of the complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: M-FISH was used in ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with R-banding CCAs to refine the complex chromosomal rearrangements, the constitute of marker chromosomes, and to identify the cryptic translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven kinds of structural rearrangements were detected by M-FISH including insertion, deletion, translocation and derivative chromosomes, among which 34 kinds were unbalanced rearrangements, and 3 were balanced rearrangements including t(6;22) (q21; q12), t(9; 19) (q13; p13) and t(3;5) (?; ?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven abnormalities in the present paper were first reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, chromosome 17 aberrations (7/10) and -5/5q - (7/10) were the two most frequent abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: M-FISH could refine CCAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, find or correct the missed or misidentified abnormalities analysed by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
