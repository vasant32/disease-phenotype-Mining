<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and HIV-Thr; however, its usefulness in thrombocytopenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients has not been directly addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a low-dose IVIg regimen (0.04 g/kg per week during five weeks) for the treatment of HIV-Thr complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients received IVIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a response to IVIg in 13 patients by the end of week one and in 10 patients by the end of week five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term response, evaluated three months after stopping IVIg, was present in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IVIg was well tolerated and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> were observed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with previous reports, we used 10% of the previously proposed dosage with an important decrease in the cost of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this low-dose IVIg regimen is a highly effective, nonexpensive alternative in treating HIV-Thr in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If sustained responses can be obtained with a similar low-dose maintenance regimen, IVIg may be the first choice for the treatment of HIV-Thr in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
