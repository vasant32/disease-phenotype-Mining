<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to previously described risk factors such as age, gender, clinical stage, and treatment modalities, splenectomy was found to correlate with an increase in risk for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assumed that splenic irradiation inducing functional <z:mp ids='MP_0000692'>hyposplenia</z:mp> and splenectomy could have similar consequences on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a series of 892 continuously disease-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> adult patients treated at a single institution between 1960 and 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> was analyzed (1) relative to the general population and (2) between risk subgroups using the Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 8 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 37 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; basal cell and in situ cervix <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 15-year cumulative incidence rate (with 95% confidence limits) was 13.2% (9.3% to 17.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to the general population incidence data, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> was multiplied by 4.68 (3.51 to 6.12; P &lt; .001); it was multiplied by 2.80 (1.63 to 4.48; P &lt; .001) in patients whose spleen was not treated and multiplied by 6.87 (4.81 to 9.51; P &lt; .001) in splenectomized patients or patients whose spleen was irradiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis that controlled for confounding variables (age, gender, clinical stage, extent of radiation therapy, and chemotherapy regimen) showed that, in addition to age above 40 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.72; P &lt; .001), combination of MOPP chemotherapy and regional irradiation (RR = 4.99; P = .015) and combination of MOPP chemotherapy and extended irradiation (RR = 10.86; P &lt; .001), splenic irradiation (RR = 3.67; P = .003), and splenectomy (RR = 2.54; P = .018) also significantly correlated with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this hospital-based registry study strongly suggest that splenic irradiation and splenectomy might increase the risk for treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings, if confirmed, have to be considered in future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> treatment policies </plain></SENT>
