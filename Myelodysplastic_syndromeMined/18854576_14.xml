<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MLL5 is a divergent member of the Drosophila Trithorax-related (SET) domain and plant homeodomain (PHD) domain-containing chromatin regulators that are involved in the regulation of transcriptional "memory" during differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human MLL5 is located on chromosome 7q22, which frequently is deleted in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, suggesting a possible role in hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we generated a loss-of-function allele (Mll5(tm1Apa)) in the murine Mll5 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike other Mll genes, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous mice are viable but display defects in immunity and hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous mice show increased susceptibility to spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye infections</z:e>, associated with a cell-autonomous impairment of neutrophil function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, Mll5(tm1Apa/tm1Apa) mice exhibit a mild impairment of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, Mll5(tm1Apa/tm1Apa) hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) have impaired competitive repopulating capacity both under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions and when subjected to self-renewal stimulation by NUP98-HOXA10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourth, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> show a dramatic sensitivity to DNA demethylation-induced differentiation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-azadeoxycytidine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that MLL5 is involved in terminal myeloid differentiation and the regulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal by a mechanism that involves DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data warrant investigation of MLL5 expression levels as a predictive marker of demethylating-agent response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and identify MLL5 as a key regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
