<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have compared chromosomal banding analysis (CBA) and FISH on fixed cultured bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, up to now, there has been no study comparing two main sources of diagnostic material, i.e. bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore analyzed these materials by FISH in comparison with CBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CBA revealed chromosomal aberrations in 18 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 3), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative syndrome (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH was performed on fixed cultured bone marrow cells, aspirates and trephine biopsies from each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentages of aberrant cells in the different materials correlated highly with Pearson values of 0.909 for biopsy/fixed cultured cells (p &lt; 0.001), 0.830 for biopsy/aspirate (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.768 for aspirate/fixed cultured cells (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in bone marrow biopsies peritrabecular and central intertrabecular areas yielded very similar FISH results with a high correlation (r = 0.968, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FISH revealed a lower proportion of aberrant cells than CBA in 90% of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the different materials available for the FISH examination are comparable in sensitivity and show similar quantitative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of biopsy sections for the routine FISH examination of chromosomal abnormalities is a valid method </plain></SENT>
