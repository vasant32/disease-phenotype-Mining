<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the promising outcomes of unrelated cord blood transplantations (UCBT) in pediatric recipients, the major limitation in the widespread use of cord blood (CB) as a source of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>), particularly in adults, is the physiological small number of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome this limitation, we developed an ex vivo expansion system for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>, in which CB CD34+ cells are cultured on feeder cells (HESS-5 cells) in the presence of cytokines (TPO, SCF and Flt3 ligand) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase I/II clinical trial, approved by our institutional review board, has been started to assess the safety and effectiveness of this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 52-year-old woman with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) received a non-myeloablative preparative regimen followed by UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 0, 75% of the whole CB and a fraction of CD34 negative cells were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 25% of the CB was CD34-selected and expanded on HESS-5 in a non-serum media in the presence of TPO, SCF, and Flt3-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 5, the ex vivo-expanded, CD34+ cells were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient received 1.83 x 10(7)/kg of total nucleated cells and 7.7 X 10(4)/kg of CD34+ cells (expanded and unexpanded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adverse effects were observed after the infusion of the cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> on day 37, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> on day 48, and died on day 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to assess the effectiveness of this protocol </plain></SENT>
