<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCR beta-chain spectratypes are complex data sets, however, and statistical tools for their comprehensive analysis are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present work was to develop a method to enable quantitative evaluation and global comparison of spectratype data from different individuals and to study the prevalence of TCR beta repertoire abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a robust statistical method based on k-means clustering analysis, and applied this method to analysis of the alphabeta TCR repertoires in 50 MDS patients and 23 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cluster analysis identified a subset of 11 MDS patients with profoundly abnormal alphabeta TCR repertoires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group of patients was characterized by advanced disease by International Prognostic Scoring System and World Health Organization criteria, increased expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>-1 oncogene, increased bone marrow myeloblast count, and older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a robust analytic algorithm that enables the comparison of alphabeta TCR repertoires between individuals and have shown that abnormal alphabeta TCR repertoire is a feature of a subset of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
