<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By August 1984, 12 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> following the use of Thorotrast have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical and haematological data indicate that most of the patients were males over 50 years of age and that the most frequent type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> involved the stem cells common to the granulocytic, erythroid and/or megakaryocytic lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This assumption was supported by the evidence of marked chromosomal rearrangements in 100% of the cells from the bone marrow in our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median latent period from the administration of Thorotrast to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in Japan was 35 years, ranging from 16 to 45 years, which indicates that patients who were injected with Thorotrast should be carefully followed up in the future </plain></SENT>
