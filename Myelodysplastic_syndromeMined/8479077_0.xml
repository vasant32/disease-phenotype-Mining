<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the results, we established scoring system (Bournemouth scoring+cytogenetic scoring: 3 for &gt; or = 3 chromosomal abnormalities; 1 for -7/7q-, +8, 2 abnormalities); patients with score of &gt; or = 5 had significant worse prognosis than that with score 0-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> with complex abnormalities consists of specific subtype showing a high leukemic rate with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were categorized into 3 subtypes, i.e., early disease-evolution, late disease-evolution, and no disease-evolution group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 50% of patients with complex abnormalities showed early disease-evolution, while the remaining died before disease-evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients showing late disease-evolution, no cytogenetic factor are informative to predict the timing of disease-evolution, except percentage of marrow blasts at the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
