<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective review compares the clinical and laboratory features of DG and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M6</z:e>) among 37 cases treated at a single institution over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DG was defined as &gt;30% proerythroblasts and the absence of a myeloblastic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory features were similar in both subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High proportions of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were noted (M6, 13 of 26 cases; DG, five of 11 cases; p = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> was common at presentation in both groups [median white blood cells (WBC), 2,600/mm3; HgB, 8.65 gm/dl; platelets, 38,000/microl] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of studied cases had chromosomal abnormalities typified by major karyotypic abnormalities (MAKA) involving three or more chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities involving chromosome 5 and/or 7 occurred in 47% (48% M6 and 45% DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both erythroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> carried a poor prognosis (M6, 6.0-month median survival; DG, 4-month survival; p = 0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among those patients choosing aggressive rather than palliative therapy, higher remission rate (80 versus 25%) and survival advantage (11.5 versus 2.5 months) were seen in M6 compared to DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, only two long-term survivors exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The similar clinical and laboratory features, cytogenetic patterns, and poor survival data suggest that the FAB classification schema should be modified to include DG </plain></SENT>
