<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors investigated whether treatment with hypomethylating agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) leads to an improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between January 2004 and December 2007, 81 patients (37 [46%] with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> [&gt;or=20% blasts]; 44 [54%] with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included 68 patients with complex (&gt;or=3) abnormalities and 13 with &lt;3 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 151 patients (126 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 25 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (128 complex, 23 noncomplex) were treated with intensive chemotherapy (including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>-based regimens in 72% and other regimes in 28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median ages for the 2 groups were 66 years and 61 years, respectively (ranges, 37-85 years and 19-89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (41%) patients in the hypomethylating group achieved complete remission (CR) versus 53 (35%) in the chemotherapy group (P=.395) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 51 weeks (range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 weeks (range, 5-128 weeks), 22 of 33 patients in the hypomethylating group and 33 of 53 patients in the chemotherapy group had developed disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median CR duration was 45 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively (P=.153) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was superior for the hypomethylating group compared with the chemotherapy group (P=.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with hypomethylating agents may be superior to chemotherapy in patients with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
