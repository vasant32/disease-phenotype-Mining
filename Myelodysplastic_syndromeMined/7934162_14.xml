<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mouse Tec is a non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase and is highly expressed in many hematopoietic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the roles of the Tec kinase in the human hematopoietic system, we isolated cDNAs encoding the human Tec kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human tec cDNAs can encode a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of 631 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73,624 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predicted human Tec protein is highly homologous to those of the members of the Tec family including mouse Tec type IV (94% homology), mouse Tsk/Itk (60%), and human Btk (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homology between human Tec and other members of the Tec family can be observed not only in the Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and kinase domains, but also in the N-terminal unique domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the major transcripts of tec could be detected at 2.6 kb and 3.6 kb in a wide range of human hematopoietic cell lines including myeloid, B-, and T-cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, high expression of the tec gene could be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the three patients examined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The human tec gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to chromosome 4p12 </plain></SENT>
