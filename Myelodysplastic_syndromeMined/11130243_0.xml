<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the incidence of main nucleolar types in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of the granulopoietic proliferating compartment in RA patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> generally did not differ in comparison with that of control patients without a disturbed granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the number of nucleoli expressed by the values of the nucleolar coefficient in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of GPC in RA patients was significantly smaller than in control persons </plain></SENT>
