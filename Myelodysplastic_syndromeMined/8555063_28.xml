<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>18 patients were common to both hypocellular groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in both of these selected groups have similar features with regard to age and sex distribution, peripheral blood and bone marrow parameters, FAB subtypes, karyotypes, leukaemic transformation, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the median age of patients in &lt; 30% BM cellularity group was higher than those patients in the age-corrected group (69 years v 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selection of &lt; 30% cellularity excluded 10 cases in the age group &lt; 70 years but included another seven patients in the age group of &gt; 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, correction of BM cellularity by age revealed that those included patients (selected for &lt; 30% cellularity) who had normocellular BM by their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore we recommend the age-correcting grouping to ensure comparable series for comparison, for response to treatment, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, BM cellularity does not appear to be an important factor on prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, because patients with hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in both selected groups have similar prognosis to those with normo/hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
