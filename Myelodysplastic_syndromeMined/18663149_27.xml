<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate initiating genomic alterations and the potential prognostic significance of cryptic genomic changes in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we performed whole genome tiling path array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on CD34(+) cells from 44 patients with an International Prognostic Scoring System score less than or equal to 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal copy number differences were detected in cells from 36 of 44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells from only 16 of the 44 patients displayed karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although most patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, aCGH identified 21 recurring copy number alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examples of frequent cryptic alterations included gains at 11q24.2-qter, 17q11.2, and 17q12 and losses at 2q33.1-q33.2, 5q13.1-q13.2, and 10q21.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of genomic integrity defined as less than 3 Mb total disruption of the genome correlated with better overall survival (P = .002) and was less frequently associated with transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (P = .033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a potential role for the use of aCGH in the clinical workup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
