<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence indicates that active treatment strategies modify the natural history of the underlying disease and hence lower the potential for leukemic transformation while prolonging survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methyltransferase inhibitor (MTI) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, in particular, has shown the capacity to extend survival in higher-risk disease in a post-approval phase III trial while demonstrating an improved risk/benefit profile in a new dosing schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By utilizing an MTI as a bridge to transplantation, allogeneic stem cell transplantation can now be postponed for appropriate candidates until a suitable donor is identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of iron chelation studies indicate that the improved compliance of an oral iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> yields greater iron storage reduction with sustained suppression of the labile plasma form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current active treatment paradigm for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incorporates the most recent strategies yielding improved disease outcomes and patient survival </plain></SENT>
