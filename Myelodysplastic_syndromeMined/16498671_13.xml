<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously reported a flow cytometry technique to monitor pharmacodynamic effects of the raf kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 based on the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) to phosphorylate extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) in peripheral blood (Chow et al., Cytometry 2001;46:72-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe its application to phase I trials of BAY 43-9006 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The previously described whole blood lysis method was used to monitor BAY 43-9006 effects on peripheral T-cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified whole blood fixation protocol was developed for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> trial, using the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (SCF) to activate ERK as an alternative to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, and incorporating immunophenotypic markers to identify leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels of BAY 43-9006 used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> patients, ERK could be activated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> in peripheral T-cells and we were not able to show inhibition of raf kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was seen in the lymphocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients during treatment with BAY 43-9006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found strong inhibition when ERK was activated via c-kit using SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor CD34+ve stem cells were much more sensitive to BAY 43-9006 when ERK was activated by SCF, compared to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the further development of flow cytometry applications to monitor signal transduction inhibitors during early phase clinical trials </plain></SENT>
