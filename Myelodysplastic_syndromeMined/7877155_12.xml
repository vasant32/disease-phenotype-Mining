<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which HLOC beliefs match the control realities in a situation (Reality Matching hypothesis) as well as the degree of threat (Threat hypothesis) posed by the situation were hypothesized to moderate the HLOC-distress relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distress, disease severity (i.e., threat), and HLOC were assessed in 69 individuals with malignant disease undergoing evaluation for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the HLOC-distress relationship was moderated by disease severity and treatment history (i.e., whether an individual had failed prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in some instances, the specific interaction relationships obtained differed from those evident in previous research with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that there is no simple main effect relationship between HLOC beliefs and psychological adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather, this relationship is best described by joint consideration of factors descriptive of the context in which the individual is embedded </plain></SENT>
