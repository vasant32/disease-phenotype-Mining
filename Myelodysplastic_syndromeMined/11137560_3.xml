<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LOH was detected at the majority (72%) of the loci tested: 47% of informative patients displayed LOH for at least one of the microsatellite locus from the region 11p15 and 23.5% of patients displayed LOH among the other markers tested within the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal follow-up of patients showed a remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of LOH appearance and its persistance during the course of the disease suggesting an intratumor clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, or alternatively, presence of LOH in more than one cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data revealed two regions of high loss of one allele in 11p15.5, defined by markers D11S1363 and D11S1338, indicating that LOH at the subtelomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 11 is a much common event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> than it was previously reported </plain></SENT>
