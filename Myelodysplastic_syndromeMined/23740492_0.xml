<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have analyzed the influence of the methylation status prior to AZA treatment on the overall survival and clinical response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation status of 24 tumor suppressor genes was analyzed by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in 63 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> treated with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients (73 %) showed methylation of at least one gene, but only 12 % of patients displayed ≥3 methylated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of a high number (≥2) of methylated genes (P = 0.022), a high WBC count (P = 0.033), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.029) were independent prognostic factors associated with shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aberrant methylation status did not correlate with the response to AZA, although four of the five patients with ≥3 methylated genes did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, favorable cytogenetics independently influenced the clinical response to AZA as 64.7 % of patients with good-risk cytogenetic abnormalities responded (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation status influences the survival of patients treated with AZA, being shorter in those patients with a high number of methylated genes </plain></SENT>
