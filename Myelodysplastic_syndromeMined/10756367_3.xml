<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (sMDS) and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (sAML) have been observed after conventional chemo/radiotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze Spanish experience regarding the incidence and characteristics of sMDS and sAML following autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We obtained information from 7 institutions which perform autologous transplantation in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from 1,081 and 1,411 patients who had received allogeneic and autologous transplantation, respectively, were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the allografted patients had developed a sMDS/sAML so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases of sMDS/sAML following autologous transplantation were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these 13 patients at the time of transplantation was 40 years (range 16-58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The crude overall incidence of sMDS/sAML was 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence did not differ according to the source of progenitor cells (1% and 0.8% for bone marrow and peripheral blood, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis showed clonal abnormalities in 11 of the 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with sMDS/sAML had received more doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> than non-sMDS patients (p = 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median time between transplantation and diagnosis of sMDS/sAML was 28 months (range 1.5-63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This time was significantly longer for patients who received bone marrow than for those who received peripheral blood (45 versus 18 months, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival after diagnosis of sMDS/sAML was 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The crude incidence of sMDS/sAML in our series was similar to other published incidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We did not find any difference in incidence between patients who had received bone marrow or peripheral blood; however, the medi an time elapsed between transplantation and sMDS diagnosis was shorter when peripheral blood was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> were associated with the appearance of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
