<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This phase II trial investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of a topotecan/thalidomide combination therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> with transformation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received three 21-day cycles of topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) on days 1-5, which was repeated for two additional cycles in patients whose bone marrow blast percentages did not decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral thalidomide was then started at 100 mg/day (with the dose escalated up to 300 mg/day if well tolerated) for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored throughout the trial for hematologic and clinical adverse events, and efficacy was assessed using International Working Group (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients, mostly elderly (median age 68 years; range 52-79 years), were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy was generally well tolerated compared to high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients died from disease progression/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> during topotecan therapy, and four patients discontinued topotecan because of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (two patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (one patient), or hip surgery (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 24 patients who received thalidomide, three discontinued because of treatment-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for response: nine (24%) had hematologic improvement and 13 (34%) had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses occurred in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients achieved transfusion independence, and one patient had a trilineage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of the patients had decreases in bone marrow blasts of 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a topotecan and thalidomide combination therapy is promising, although further studies are needed to determine the optimum doses and schedule </plain></SENT>
