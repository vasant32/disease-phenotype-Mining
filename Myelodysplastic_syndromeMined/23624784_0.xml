<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used i.v. coadministration of the human marrow stroma cell line HS27a with CD34+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells in Nod.cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1wjll) (NSG) mice to provide signals that would facilitate engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic cells from 24 MDS patients were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were engrafted, and engraftment was documented in 44 of 46 evaluable mice (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed human HS27a stroma colocalizing with human hematopoietic cells in mouse spleens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human CD34+ precursors harvested from marrow and spleen of primary murine recipients, when combined with HS27a cells, were also engrafted successfully in secondary NSG recipients, showing persistence of the original clonal characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the concept that clonal markers were present in long-term repopulating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that HS27a stroma cells 'traveled' in direct contact with hematopoietic precursors and enabled their propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An essential signal for engraftment appears to be CD146, which is prominently expressed on HS27a cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This xenotransplantation model will allow to further dissect signals that control engraftment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells and should be amenable to in vivo treatment studies </plain></SENT>
