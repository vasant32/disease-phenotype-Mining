<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient in whom the concomitant diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (16% on initial marrow examination) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> was made more than 9 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myeloid clone showed a complex karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evolution has so far been remarkably stable, without transformation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic assays showed that patient's serum inhibited the patient's own granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was also present for a control subject's CFU-GM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This raises the problem of a down-regulation of the myeloid clone by the malignant lymphoid clone in this patient, and the possible mechanisms for this are discussed </plain></SENT>
