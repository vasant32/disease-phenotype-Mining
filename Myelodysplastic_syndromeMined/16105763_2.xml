<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (BU) therapies, each in combination with total body irradiation (TBI), affect the outcome of stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted with 31 patients who received bone marrow from an HLA-matched sibling and underwent treatment with BU-TBI (n = 18) or CY-TBI (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) grades II to IV was higher, but not significantly, in the BU-TBI group (58.8%) than in the CY-TBI group (30.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> extensive GVHD were significantly different (41.7% [CY-TBI] versus 80.0% [BU-TBI], P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trends after BU-TBI conditioning indicated a lower 3-year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) (38.1% versus 53.9%, P = .4), lower relapse rates (28.5% versus 36.4%, P = .8), and higher nonrelapse mortality rates (46.7% versus 15.4%, P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the International Prognostic Scoring System risk group and the cytogenetic risk group, DFS in the CY-TBI group (relative risk, 9.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-52.5; P = .015) was found to be significantly increased compared with the BU-TBI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approaches to minimize transplantation-related toxicity should be pursued, and efforts other than the potentiation of the conditioning regimen should be made to reduce the likelihood of posttransplantation relapse </plain></SENT>
