<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>sMDS occurs years after MM diagnosis, and typically, at sMDS presentation the MM is stable or inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 56-year-old patient, who developed sMDS 15 years following the diagnosis of IgG-lambda MM, which had been completely stable for 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, very soon after sMDS was diagnosed, the MM relapsed and required combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first cycle of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, adriamycin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (VAD) resulted in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, which was treated with antibiotics and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after GM-CSF administration a transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
