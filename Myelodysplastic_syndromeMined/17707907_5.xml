<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 358 consecutive del(5q) cases were identified; specific diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 53%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; 22%), plasma cell proliferative disorder (PCPD; 9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>; 7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL; 2%), PCPD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e> (2%), and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML; 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures in the absence/presence of prior cytotoxic treatment (n=250/108) were 61%/34% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 24%/19% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 4%/20% for PCPD, 6%/8% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, 1%/4% for ALL, and 2%/4% for ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>del(5q) occurred as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in 88 cases (25%) including 76 without prior cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, 82% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 8% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 5% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, 4% PCPD, and 1% ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 5 breakpoints included q13q33 in 49% of the cases, q15q33 in 22%, q22q33 in 8%, and q13 in 3% and their distribution was not affected by specific diagnosis or treatment history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>del(5q)-associated lymphoid disorders featured a higher prevalence of previous cytotoxic therapy and smaller number del(5q)-positive metaphases, when compared to their counterparts with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that del(5q), although most prevalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, is seen across the spectrum of myeloid disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and its occurrence in lymphoid disorders might signify, for the most part, an occult myeloid clone </plain></SENT>
