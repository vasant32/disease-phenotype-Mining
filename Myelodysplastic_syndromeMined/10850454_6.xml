<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genetic events that may play an important role in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), we performed allelotype analysis of 24 individuals using matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the evolution can take years to occur, we used DNAs extracted from archival samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These samples were analyzed with 79 microsatellite markers, which mapped to each of the autosomal arms except the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> of the acrocentric chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity on at least one locus was observed in 18 of the 24 cases (75%) as the disease progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequent allelic loss in &gt;20% of the informative cases was observed on chromosome arms 6q (31%), 7p (23%), 10p (31%), 11q (27%), 14q (25%), and 20q (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although cytogenetic information was available for many of our cases with allelic loss on 6q, 7p, 10p, 11q, 14q, and 20q, no deletions were observed on these arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractional allelic loss, calculated for each sample as the total number of chromosomal arms lost per total number of arms with information, showed a median value of 0.06 and a mean of 0.15 (range, 0-0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No microsatellite instability at more than one marker was found in any of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes exist on 6q, 7p, 10p, 11q, 14q, and 20q that have an important role in the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> when they are mutated </plain></SENT>
