<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects and predisposition to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Causal mutations have been identified in the RUNX1 gene (also known as AML1, CBFA2) in the 11 families so far analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RUNX1 is a gene frequently involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, through acquired chromosome rearrangements and point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report an Italian family with three members affected with FPD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, two sibs and their father, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (which in one subsequently evolved into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing and polymorphisms haplotype analysis of the region of chromosome 21 where RUNX1 is mapped demonstrated that FPD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in this family was not caused by any mutation of the RUNX1 gene, thus providing evidence for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in the marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three affected subjects, as well as an independent clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of mutator effects in the pathogenesis of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> characterized by relevant chromosome changes, in the presence or absence of an underlying Mendelian disorder, has already been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results and a review of the cytogenetic literature led us to postulate that mutations also causing FPD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may have a mutator effect that could give origin to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> through acquired chromosome changes </plain></SENT>
