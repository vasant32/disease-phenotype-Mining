<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most significantly deregulated pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> include interferon signaling, thrombopoietin signaling and the Wnt pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the most significantly deregulated gene pathways in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and chemokine signaling, whereas advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is characterized by deregulation of DNA damage response and checkpoint pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified distinct gene expression profiles and deregulated gene pathways in patients with del(5q), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or -7/del(7q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 are characterized by deregulation of pathways involved in the immune response, patients with -7/del(7q) by pathways involved in cell survival, whereas patients with del(5q) show deregulation of integrin signaling and cell cycle regulation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to determine deregulated gene pathways and ontology groups in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> of a large group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deregulated pathways identified are likely to be critical to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> phenotype and give new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, thereby providing new targets for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
