<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression of a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to ineffective hematopoiesis, we observed that NHD13 mice were lymphopenic; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> was due to a decrease in both T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the pro-B cell (B220(+)/CD43(+)) populations from the NHD13 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were similar, the NHD13 mice showed decreased pre-B cells (B220(+)/CD43(-)), indicating impaired differentiation at the pro-B to pre-B stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thymi from NHD13 mice were smaller and overexpressed Hoxa cluster genes, including Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the NHD13 thymi contained fewer thymocytes, with an increased percentage of CD4(-)/CD8(-) (double-negative (DN)) cells and a decreased percentage of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (double-positive) cells; the DN1/DN2 population was increased and the DN3/DN4 population was decreased, suggesting a partial block at the DN2 to DN3 transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine clonality of the thymocytes, we used degenerate RT-PCR to identify clonal Tcrb gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of six NHD13 thymi showed an unusual Tcrb gene rearrangement pattern with common, clonal DJ rearrangements, but distinct V-D junctions, suggesting a marked clonal expansion of thymocytes that had undergone a DJ rearrangement, but not completed a VDJ rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that expression of the NHD13 transgene inhibits lymphoid as well as myeloid and erythroid differentiation, results in overexpression of Hoxa cluster genes, and leads to a precursor T cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
