<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) is an effective and safe therapy for patients without undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of rabbit-ATG (r-ATG) combined with CsA as an intensive immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2003 to November 2008, 46 children (30 boys and 16 girls), with a median age of 7 years (between 2 and 15 years) were diagnosed with acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They received an IST of r-ATG combined with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average time was 3.4 months (ranging from 1 to 13 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effective rates 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment were 30.4, 65.2, 78.8, and 84.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 years of follow-up, the response rate was 84.8% (39/46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No response was found in five cases and relapse was found in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the five cases without response, two received unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are already disease-free and two died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> caused by long-term dependence on infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was found among the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose that r-ATG combined with CsA as an intensive IST is effective and safe in treating acquired SAA in children </plain></SENT>
