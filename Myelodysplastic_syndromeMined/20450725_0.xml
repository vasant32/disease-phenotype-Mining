<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative assessment of CD11b, CD13, CD16 and HLA-DR expression on the membrane of bone marrow granulocytes, and CD71 and glycophorin A on erythroblasts of 12 MDS patients in low-risk, 22 in high-risk and 31 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was conducted with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the abnormality and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The granulocytic differentiation was analyzed with the combinations of CD13/CD11b, CD13/CD16 and CD11b/CD16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The "right hook", "sickle" and "retroflex 7" shape expressions were found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls while there were various changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratios of CD11b-/CD11b+ (0.39 +/- 0.34) and CD16-/CD16+ (1.33 +/- 0.77) were significantly higher in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group than those of control group (0.07 +/- 0.05 and 0.39 +/- 0.31 respectively) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MFI (mean fluorescence index) of SSC (side scatter) in the granulocyte gate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups was lower while MFI of CD13 was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean percentages of CD11b-HLA-DR+ 3.88% +/- 3.07%, CD11b-HLA-DR- 16.23% +/- 15.59%, CD16-HLA-DR- 41.12% +/- 24.53%, CD11b+CD16- 33.53% +/- 17.26% and CD13+CD16- 44.51% +/- 21.99% granulocytes of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group were significantly higher than those of low-risk and control groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The erythroid cell lineage differentiation was analyzed with CD71/glycophorin A combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double positive expression was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls, but asynchronous expression of CD71/glycophorin A was found in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of double positive cells in CD45- and glycophorin A+ cell population was significantly lower in low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The abnormal numbers and patterns of the antigen expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases per case correlated directly with their IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) (r = 0.690, P = 0.000) and WPSS (WHO adapted prognostic scoring system) (r = 0.651, P = 0.000) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is an abnormal expression of differentiation antigens on bone marrow myeloid cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>And the severity is correlated with the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells is probably involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>So the examination of these antigenic expressions with flow cytometry might be helpful for diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
