<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the cytoplasmic and serum levels of lysozyme in <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> were significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No correlation, however, was found between their cytoplasmic and serum levels of lysozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis for various kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> indicated that myelocytic and monocytic cells became highly positive for lysozyme staining with maturation, and that lymphocytes, leukemic myeloblasts and monoblasts were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic and serum lysozyme levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> having a number of lysozyme-positive cells were elevated as compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023479" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="AMML">FAB M4</z:e>) revealed an excellent correlation between the lysozyme levels in cytoplasm and in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rest whose serum lysozyme level tend to be lower than the cytoplasmic one gave poor correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, serum lysozyme level is not fully reflected by the cytoplasmic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dual determination of cytoplasmic and serum lysozyme is suggested to be helpful on estimating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> types, the degree of cellular maturation and total cell mass, and might also provide a valuable tool for prediction of prognosis for these disorders </plain></SENT>
