<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We compare the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> and pediatric WHO systems against each other and against the French, American, British (FAB) and adult WHO classifications in order to determine which more accurately classifies these diseases and predicts outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An 18-year retrospective review identified patients less than 18 years of age meeting <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> and/or pediatric WHO criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resolution, stability, progression, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the subcategories of each system were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pediatric WHO: 17 patients met criteria, 10 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (seven died), one juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>) (died), one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) (currently in relapse), two died of complications, two responded to BMT, three have stable disease, one resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were not classifiable by the pediatric WHO system, one of which progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>: 26 patients met criteria, 9 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (8 died), 1 died of complications, 10 responded to treatment (BMT and/or chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four are stable without treatment, two resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> were not classifiable by the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the pediatric WHO and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> systems are better able to classify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in children than the adult WHO and FAB classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pediatric WHO system is more exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Children meeting these criteria are more likely to progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The restrictive nature of the pediatric WHO system was unable to classify one case of fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> system is more inclusive and can stratify patients into a neutral or poor prognosis based upon outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> system ignores those diseases with a myeloprolifferative component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This resulted in two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> that were unclassifiable by the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One of these patients died, the other is currently in relapse </plain></SENT>
