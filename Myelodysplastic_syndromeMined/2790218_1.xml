<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our patients total abstinence from alcohol without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi> or similar drugs led to reversal of the pathological findings in peripheral blood and in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing detoxification while taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi>, on the other hand, the pathological bone marrow findings, especially erythropoiesis associated with impaired iron utilization, persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolic pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is probably justifiable to assume that the toxin responsible for alcohol-induced bone marrow damage is the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The persistence of erythropoiesis with impaired iron utilization during abstinence from alcohol and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi> is also of importance in differential diagnosis from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and especially from refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this reason, where the situation is unclear, it is essential that a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> be supported by specific investigations such as cell cultures, cytogenetic analyses, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is the first time that the toxic, alcohol-like-effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi> on haematopoiesis is discussed </plain></SENT>
