<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and 12 Gy of total-body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the donor marrow was rejected, hematopoiesis by the recipient himself recovered and he has remained in complete remission for more than 8 years after stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow karyotype analysis 1 month after SCT showed random chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although complete remission was maintained, various chromosomal aberrations were detected in marrow cells, and in peripheral blood cells under phytohemagglutinin stimulation over 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a clone including del(20)(q11) appeared in marrow cells 7 months after SCT and thereafter was also detected 5 years later in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This persistence of various chromosomal aberrations and a stable clone without evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> support the multi step theory of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
