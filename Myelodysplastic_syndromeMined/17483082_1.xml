<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed chromosome fragility tests with 56 FA patients and with 50 non-FA patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated peripheral blood lymphocyte specimens cultured for 72 hours and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) metabolites, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), and fludarabine (Flu) metabolite (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine [2-F-Ara-A]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> and CY metabolite tests were highly sensitive and specific for FA (P&lt;10(-4)) for both tests), and the number of aberrations per cell for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> correlated with that for the CY metabolite test (P &lt; 10(-4)) but did not correlate with the number of aberrations per cell for the Ara-C and 2-F-Ara-A tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in breakage frequencies between FA and non-FA patients for cultures treated with 2-F-Ara-A was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the breakages observed in cells treated with 2-F-Ara-A-and Ara-C were chromatid breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be possible to determine the appropriate CY dose in the preconditioning regimen for SCT in FA patients on the basis of the in vitro effects on fragility, and Flu or Ara-C may be a safer drug than high-dose CY for conditioning in FA patients </plain></SENT>
