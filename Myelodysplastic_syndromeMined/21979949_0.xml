<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the consequences of single amino acid mutations, including those implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, at the DNMT3A·DNMT3A homotetramer and DNMT3A·DNMT3L heterotetramer interfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A model for the DNMT3A homotetramer was developed via computational interface scanning and tested using light scattering and electrophoretic mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distinct oligomeric states were functionally characterized using fluorescence anisotropy and steady-state kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replacement of residues that result in DNMT3A dimers, including those identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, show minor changes in methylation activity but lose the capacity for processive catalysis on multisite DNA substrates, unlike the highly processive <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the bimodal distribution of DNA methylation in vivo and the loss of clustered methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tetramerization with the known interacting partner DNMT3L rescues processive catalysis, demonstrating that protein binding at the DNMT3A tetramer interface can modulate methylation patterning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a structural mechanism for the regulation of DNMT3A activity and epigenetic imprinting </plain></SENT>
