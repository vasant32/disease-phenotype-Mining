<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MF) often develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> in the early posttransplantation period; however, this has not yet been studied in a systematic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated 53 patients with MF who underwent HCT to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> liver toxicity and risk factors and the impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hepatic complications in that group and a matched control group of 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MF group, during the first 6 weeks after HCT, the incidence of mild (34.2-102.6 μM), moderate (102.6-342 μM), and severe (&gt;342 μM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> was 34%, 40%, and 4%, respectively (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &lt;22 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of mild/moderate transaminitis (2-10 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) was 23%, and that of severe transaminitis (&gt;10 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">Veno-occlusive disease</z:e> as defined by the Baltimore criteria was observed in 19 patients (36%) in the MF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MF was associated with a significantly higher incidence of moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (44% versus 21%; P = .02) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (36% versus 19%; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, biopsy-proven hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, or splanchnic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was a strong predictor of moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> hepatocellular injury with moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> or transaminitis was associated with inferior survival at 12 months (P = .02) in the MF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with MF are at significant risk of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> after HCT, which is associated with an adverse impact on survival </plain></SENT>
