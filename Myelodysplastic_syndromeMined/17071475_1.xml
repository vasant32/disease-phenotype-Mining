<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, therapeutic options are limited to platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only commercially available growth factor that increases platelet counts is interleukin-11 (IL-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a phase II trial to more accurately assess the clinical response and toxicity data for low-dose IL-11 (10 microg/kg/day) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, nine of 32 assessable patients (28%) demonstrated increases in their platelet counts after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, five were considered major platelet responses (15%), as defined by World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had minor platelet responses (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of platelet response was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-dose IL-11 was well tolerated, with no observed grade 4 toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study provides additional clinical evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of IL-11, at low doses, can raise platelet counts and reduce platelet transfusion requirements in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
