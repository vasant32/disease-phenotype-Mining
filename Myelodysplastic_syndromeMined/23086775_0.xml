<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant antigen expression on bone marrow (BM) blasts may identify "low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>." This study aimed to examine differences in antigen expression on CD34+ BM cells between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and those with secondary cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM aspirates of 175 patients with cytopenia were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or secondary cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of stem cell antigens (CD34, CD133), myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33), B-cell antigens (CD19, CD10), growth factor receptors (CD117, CD123), and chemokine receptor (CD184) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults and 49 patients with CD34+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High percentage of CD34+ cells, CD117 and CD123 overexpression, and abnormal CD45 expression on these cells are the best markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic aberrancies correlate with number of blasts and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and were similar to those in CD34+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, thus reflecting the relationship between these disorders </plain></SENT>
