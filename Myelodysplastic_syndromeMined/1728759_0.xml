<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various clinical variables were assessed at admission and related to the outcome of IC treatment in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, 33 patients had undergone chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight (21%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of a subgroup of 13 bone marrow transplantation patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoxaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> requiring mechanical ventilation was the most frequent reason for admission (20 patients of whom four recovered) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second most frequent reason was combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and septic shock (eight patients, none recovered) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three out of five patients admitted with septic shock survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The need for mechanical ventilation had the highest predictive power for a poor prognosis (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality increased with increasing APACHE II score (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When more than four major organ systems were affected (seven patients), mortality was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>Granulocytopenia</z:hpo> (leucocyte count less than 1 x 10(9)/l) at admission turned out to be of no prognostic significance, but absence of leucocyte recovery was a prognostically bad sign (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
