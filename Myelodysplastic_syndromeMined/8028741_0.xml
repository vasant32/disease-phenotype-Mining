<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies aiming to describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> occurring in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been carried out in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> found in 22 myelodysplastic patients at the time of diagnosis (RA: 2 cases; ASIA: 4 cases; AREB: 6 cases; AREB-T: 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMMC: 4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matched with similarly aged healthy people (controls) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients revealed a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> mainly due to a reduction both in number and percentage of T-helper series with decreased OK T4/OK T8 ratio as a result; even B-cells were reduced in number but their percentage still overlapped with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 22 patients, 13 showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> (polyclonal in 12 cases, monoclonal in the one left) and 2 read positive for Coomb's and Ana-test respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The involvement of T-cell immunity in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be explained if we consider the clonal origin of such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among myelodysplastic patients the ones affected by LMMC, AREB and AREB-T show the heaviest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo>: in these cases the whole of T-cells subsets and NK cells as well are affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eventually, the mentioned abnormalities are of paramount importance to explain how easily these patients can develop both severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> and abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
