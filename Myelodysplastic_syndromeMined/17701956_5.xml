<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rarely, patients who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and are diagnosed initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) subsequently develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been controversy regarding whether the initial diagnosis of AA is correct or whether these patients have hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied bone marrow (BM) specimens from patients who were diagnosed initially with AA and subsequently with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from a cohort of 128 consecutive patients who had AA during the period from 1993 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed to assess for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 retrospectively in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified (age range, 26-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time they were diagnosed with AA, there was no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the median BM cellularity was 5% (range, from &lt;1% to 15%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy for 11 patients included immunomodulating agents, which were accompanied by growth factors in 4 patients and 1 patient underwent BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient received growth factors only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median interval to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 9 months (range, 2-43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median BM cellularity was 30% (range, 5-90%), and dysplastic changes were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had an abnormal karyotype, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was the most common abnormality (n = 5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FISH detected <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in 6 samples at the time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in specimens that were considered AA and the short time interval to a subsequent diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suggests that these patients had hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therapy may allow the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by enhancing cell growth </plain></SENT>
