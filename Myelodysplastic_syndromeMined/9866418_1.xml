<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients included 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood specimens were also obtained from a control group consisting of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (IDA), 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) and 10 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic granulocytes (Apo-Gs) were identified by morphological changes, including nuclear fragmentation, and expressed as a percentage of every 300 granulocytes counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apo-Gs were counted 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours after incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the percentage of apo-Gs climbed over time in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, a small number of apo-Gs were also observed in the healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the proportions of apo-Gs 5 hours after incubation (37 degrees C) were significantly higher than those in the IDA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients and healthy individuals (15.7 +/- 8.0% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients vs. 2.8 +/- 1.2% in IDA patients, 2.3 +/- 1.7% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, and 0.7 +/- 0.6% in healthy individuals; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
