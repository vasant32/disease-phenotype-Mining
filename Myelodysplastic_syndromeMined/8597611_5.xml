<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of peripheral blood cells revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as the sole cytogenetic defect at the time of diagnosis of ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two years earlier, when MM was diagnosed without any cytological evidence of co-existent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells showed the same pathological karyotype 47, XY, +8 in 14 of 20 mitoses studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our interpretation of this unusual cytogenetic finding is that at the time of diagnosis of MM, in spite of lacking cytological signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, an unrecognizable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> must have been present which then evolved to ANLL </plain></SENT>
