<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To learn more about the basic mechanisms involved, we used Southern blot analysis to study four patients with different 7q--deletions to determine the exact break-points and to define the extent of the deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several genes and DNA sequences from 16 different loci were found to be deleted, as judged by the absence or considerable weakening of an allelic band in granulocytic DNA in patients with constitutional heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A terminal segment was present in each of the partially deleted chromosomes, as shown by heterozygosity for probes from the region 7q35----qter in granulocyte DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the chromosome 7q deletions were interstitial, rather than terminal, in each of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of the preserved terminal segment varied among the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support gene loss as a mechanism contributing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the deletions are interstitial, hybrid genes may be formed at the junction, but the variation in breakpoints argues against the existence of a common hybrid gene of importance to the malignant process </plain></SENT>
