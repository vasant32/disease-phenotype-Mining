<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 cases could be evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> for these 11 probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our experiments show that in seven of these randomly selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> bone marrow cell suspensions numerical aberrations for one or two chromosomes could be detected by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> on interphase nuclei and in some cases on metaphase preparations were compared with karyotyping data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven cases of chromosomal aberrations observed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> (three for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> and four for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>) were confirmed by this classical cytogenetic technique, whereas in five instances an aberration was found only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> (twice for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>, twice for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>, and one disomy for the Y-probe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for chromosome 1 observed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> on interphase nuclei could be explained by a marker chromosome, a finding that was further substantiated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> on metaphase spreads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case double-target <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> on interphase cells with the probes for chromosomes 1 and 16 strongly suggested a translocation between these chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, in one case a marker chromosome could be characterized as a translocation between chromosomes 7 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this latter case the cytogenetic examinations revealed only <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for chromosomes 7 and 17 in addition to noncharacterized marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the nonradioactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> procedure in combination with chromosome specific repetitive centromeric probes is a powerful tool for studying both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in interphase nuclei of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may therefore become a valuable and routine diagnostic tool in addition to the existing karyotyping procedures </plain></SENT>
