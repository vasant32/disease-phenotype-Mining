<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AA bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) are profoundly deficient in colony-forming cells, and AA progenitors fail to proliferate in long-term assays even in the presence of an intact stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to characterize some quantitative and qualitative aspects of the progenitor cell defect in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometric analysis of BM from new AA patients and from those recovering after immunosuppressive therapy, we determined that the numbers of CD34+ and CD33+ cells were markedly decreased in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although PB neutrophil counts did not correlate with BM CD34+ cell numbers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease, there was an association between the overall severity of the disease and the degree of CD34+ cell reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease in BM CD33+ cells was a common finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but reduction in CD34+ cells was found only in some hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sorting experiments demonstrated lower plating efficiency for purified CD34+ cells from AA BM in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, diminished colony formation of total BM appeared to result from both quantitative and qualitative defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the association between increased cycling and c-kit receptor expression on CD34+ cells, we found that the mitotically active CD34+ cells bearing the c-kit antigen were reduced in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With clinical improvement, CD34+ and CD33+ cells increased in correlation with PB parameters, but they did not return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sorted CD34+ cells from recovered patents showed improved plating efficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
