<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using conditional inactivation of the ribosomal protein S6 gene in laboratory mice, we found that reduced ribosomal protein gene dosage recapitulates cardinal features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo>, and megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, and that p53 plays a critical role in manifestation of these phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002429'>blood cell abnormalities</z:mp> are accompanied by a reduction in the number of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, a specific defect in late erythrocyte development, and suggest a disease-specific ontogenetic pathway for megakaryocyte development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies of highly purified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> from healthy patients and from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> link reduced expression of ribosomal protein genes to decreased RBC maturation and suggest an underlying and common pathophysiologic pathway for additional subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
