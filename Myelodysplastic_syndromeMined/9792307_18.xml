<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better define the role of exposure to myelotoxic agents in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we carried out (a) a case-control study for the determination of the relative risk (RR) of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 178 consecutive patients and 178 sex- and age-matched controls: (b) a study of clinicobiological features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> arising after occupational exposure to myelotoxic agents and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 'non-exposed' patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The definition of the 'exposure' status was based on a predetermined questionnaire, with calculation of an 'exposure' index (hours/day x days/year x years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative exposure to pesticides or to organic solvents, for &gt;2400 h, was recorded in 48 and 25 MDS patients, respectively, compared to 27 and four controls (P&lt;0.00001; RR 3.74; 95% confidence interval 2.02-5.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Older age and an excess of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts was noted among 'exposed' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients (group 1), compared to non-exposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>68.3% patients in group 1 had clonal chromosome changes, compared with 43.2% patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotypes, -7/7q-, -5/5q-, +8, 7p and 17p aberrations were seen more frequently in group 1, whereas a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, isolated 5q- or 20q- occurred more frequently in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of exposure to myelotoxic agents with older age at presentation and with unfavourable chromosome changes accounted for the shorter survival observed in 'exposed' patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that occupational exposure to pesticides and organic solvents in our region resulted in an increased RR of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that a distinct cytogenetic profile was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 'exposed' patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide strong indirect evidence that these agents may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, preferentially targeting some of the chromosome regions which are frequently involved in therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
