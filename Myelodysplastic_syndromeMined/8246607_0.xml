<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This MPO release was greatly augmented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">Cytochalasin</z:chebi> B (Cy B), but after the addition of Cy B the priming effects of GM-CSF became less obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure to GM-CSF without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> did not enhance MPO release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within whole blood, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> produced negligible MPO release, but priming with GM-CSF prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> always resulted in a significant increase in MPO release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic neutrophils released similar amounts of MPO in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>, compared with control cells (3.4 +/- 0.8 mU/10(7) control cells compared to 2.7 +/- 0.3 mU/10(7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Priming with GM-CSF produced an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated MPO release comparable with control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In terms of total MPO content, although some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exhibited low levels, as a group there was no significant difference from controls (169 +/- 21 mU/10(7) control cells compared with 157 +/- 19 mU/10(7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MPO activity is not a universal defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and cannot account for the defects in respiratory burst activity in these neutrophils </plain></SENT>
