<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: More than 50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> present cytogenetic aberrations at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is the most frequent abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to apply fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 in patients diagnosed with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in whom conventional banding cytogenetics study had shown a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, absence of metaphases or an abnormal karyotype without evidence of del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 in 716 patients, divided into two groups: group A patients (n=637) in whom the 5q deletion had not been detected at diagnosis by conventional banding cytogenetics and group B patients (n=79), in whom cytogenetic analysis had revealed the 5q deletion (positive control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A (n=637), the 5q deletion was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 38 cases (5.96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of positive cases were diagnosed as having the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deletion was mainly observed in cases in which the cytogenetics study had shown no metaphases or an aberrant karyotype with chromosome 5 involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group B (n=79), the 5q deletion had been observed by cytogenetics and was confirmed to be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 detected the 5q deletion in 6% of cases without clear evidence of del(5q) by conventional banding cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 should be performed in cases of a suspected '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>' and/or if the cytogenetic study shows no metaphases or an aberrant karyotype with chromosome 5 involved (no 5q- chromosome) </plain></SENT>
