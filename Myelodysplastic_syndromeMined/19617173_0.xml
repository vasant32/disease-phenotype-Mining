<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epidemiologic and prognostic aspects of these diseases are not well known in developing countries notably in Africa sub-Saharan countries because of lack of registry and clinical collaborative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the good progress in the management of paediatric diseases that were a big concerns in former times authorize to think that in future, these countries will be engaged in programs to fit malignant diseases as major health problems in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A good knowledge of epidemiologic aspects of these diseases must be therefore an important concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study describes epidemiologic and prognosis particularities of malignant hemopathies in children diagnosed in a last referral hospital ward, Bamako, Mali (West Africa) during height years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine cases of malignant hemopathies were diagnosed by January 1996 to December 2003 in 19 females and 40 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed retrospectively with SPSS 11.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These children were aged from 4 to 15 years and the modal class of age was 6-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean recruitment of cases per year was 7.37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> were more frequent (70%) particularly the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was not observed under 5 years of age but represents 24% of cases over this age and was more frequent in male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the need to put in place strategies for a better understanding of epidemiological aspects of malignant hemopathies in children and for developing policies to improve management and prevention of cases in Mali </plain></SENT>
