<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been studied extensively, there is little information available on the mature, non-blast myeloid cells (NBMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a retrospective case-control study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NBMC populations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (48 cases) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free control (12 cases) bone marrow samples were analyzed using multiparameter flow cytometry for mean side scatter (SSC) channel number and for expression of aberrant cell surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were stratified on the basis of cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
