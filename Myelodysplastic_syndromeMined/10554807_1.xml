<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DI in patients was compared to that of corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell types, and to cytogenetic data available in 32/39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean DI in bla/pro of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower compared to corresponding cell types in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By ICM, a DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in bla/pro was found in 67% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and 59% expressed DNA hypodiploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By cytogenetics, an abnormal karyotype was found in 31%, and 6/9 MDS patients with a 'hypodiploid' abnormal karyotype showed DNA hypodiploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (69%), seven (32%) showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 12 (55%) a lower, and three (14%) a higher DI compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference between groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA hypodiploidy is suggested to be a common feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without a relationship to cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
