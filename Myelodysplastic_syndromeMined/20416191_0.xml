<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By a long term (6 years) follow-up of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, peripheral blood cell count, bone marrow cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and conventional cytogenetics were monitored regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to confirm the aberrant karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that this patient was failed with conventional chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but had response to ATRA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> in the 72 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At initial diagnosis, the cytogenetics analysis showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, whereas 46, XY, 2q+[1]/46, XY[19] was found at 48 months, 46, XY, dup(1q)[3]/46, XY[7] at 56 months, and dup (1) as well as der (11) with complex karyotype at 68 months, which was accompanied by progressive decrease of platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that karyotype evolution is perhaps associated with progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
