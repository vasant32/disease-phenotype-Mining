<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of effective treatments has been impeded by limited insight into pathogenic pathways governing dysplastic growth of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that smad2, a downstream mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor I kinase (TBRI) activation, is constitutively activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow (BM) precursors and is overexpressed in gene expression profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells, providing direct evidence of overactivation of TGF-beta pathway in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suppression of the TGF-beta signaling by lentiviral shRNA-mediated down-regulation of TBRI leads to in vitro enhancement of hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of TBRI (alk5) kinase by a small molecule inhibitor, SD-208, inhibits smad2 activation in hematopoietic progenitors, suppresses TGF-beta-mediated gene activation in BM stromal cells, and reverses TGF-beta-mediated cell-cycle arrest in BM CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SD-208 treatment alleviates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and stimulates hematopoiesis in vivo in a novel murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> generated by constitutive hepatic expression of TGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro pharmacologic inhibition of TBRI kinase leads to enhancement of hematopoiesis in varied morphologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data directly implicate TGF-beta signaling in the pathobiology of ineffective hematopoiesis and identify TBRI as a potential therapeutic target in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
