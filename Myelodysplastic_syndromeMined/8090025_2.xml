<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had RA, 18 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) &lt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l, and ten had ANC between 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had experienced &gt; or = WHO grade II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>(s) during the preceding 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (64%) had a response (i.e. ANC at least doubled and &gt; or = 1 x 10(9)/l after 1 month), including 4/8 patients treated at 0.25 mu/kg/day, and 14/20 treated at 0.5 microgram/kg/day (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the non-responders obtained a response after dose escalation to 0.5 and 1 microgram/kg/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only prognostic factor of response was FAB subtype (10/11 responses in patients with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, vs. 8/17 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with ANC &lt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l had a 55% (10/18) response rate, which was not significantly lower than the 80% (8/10) response rate observed in patients with ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side-effects were generally moderate, except in three patients where the drug had to be discontinued, including the only patient who progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In responders, GM-CSF was continued during 2 to 14 months (median 6), and the response persisted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case, who relapsed after 60 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, only one responder had &gt; or = WHO grade II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, as compared to five of the non-responders (of whom two had fatal infectious episodes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, very low-dose GM-CSF can durably increase ANC in about two thirds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although it remains to be shown in randomized trials that it can reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and improve survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, very low-dose GM-CSF may be an interesting approach in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, associated to reasonable cost </plain></SENT>
