<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies have suggested that a T-cell subset with a CD4-/CD8- double-negative (DN) T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> is capable of suppressing GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double-negative T cells can be mobilized into the peripheral blood with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and enriched by density centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study was performed to study the feasibility and safety of applying a density gradient separation technique for enrichment of CD34+ and DN T cells, while depleting CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells from peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for the purpose of allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> were treated with a myeloablative preparative regimen consisting of fractionated total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen identical donors were mobilized with G-CSF PBPC collected by apheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apheresis product was applied to a single-step density gradient, and the low-density cell population was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low-density cell population was infused as the sole source of allogeneic cells after myeloablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD34 cell recovery was efficient with a median 72% yield, providing for a median CD34+ cell dose of 6.5 x 10(6)/kg (range,1.0- 13.9 x 10(6)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+ SP T cells were depleted by a median of 94.4% (range, 58.8- 99.2%), and the ratio of CD34+:SP T cells increased 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Double-negative T cells were depleted by 92% (range, 18.8- 99.4%), thus the ratio of DN:SP T cells increased less than 2-fold in 71% of apheresis samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic engraftment was rapid, and there was no occurrence of graft failure in examinable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median time to absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L was 10.5 and 12 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6-45%), although not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were examinable due to an unexpectedly high nonrecurrence mortality that at Day 180 was 62% (95% CI, 40-83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that T-cell subset manipulation via density gradient separation is a safe procedure and allowed rapid hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Selective enrichment of a donor DN T-cell subset was observed in only a few and was not associated with a reduced incidence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the low-density selected cells still resulted in GVHD, and there was a high treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
