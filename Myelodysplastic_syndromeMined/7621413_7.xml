<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The predictive potential of six selected factors was assessed in 72 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of survival at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors were age (above median of 69 years), dysplastic features in the three myeloid bone marrow cell lineages, presence of chromosome defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases abnormal, double or complex chromosome defects (C23), and a Bournemouth score of 2, 3, or 4 (B234) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate approach, B234 and C23 proved to be significantly associated with a reduction in the survival probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the regression coefficients associated with these two factors means that they have about the same weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the model was simplified by counting the number of factors (0, 1, or 2) present in each patient, thus generating a scoring system called the Lausanne-Bournemouth score (LB score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LB score combines the well-recognized and easy-to-use Bournemouth score (B score) with the chromosome defect complexity, C23 constituting an additional indicator of patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predicted risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 18 months calculated from the model is as follows: 7.1% (confidence interval: 1.7-24.8) for patients with an LB score of 0, 60.1% (44.7-73.8) for an LB score of 1, and 96.8% (84.5-99.4) for an LB score of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scoring system presented here has several interesting features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LB score may improve the predictive value of the B score, as it is able to recognize two prognostic groups in the intermediate risk category of patients with B scores of 2 or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has also the ability to identify two distinct prognostic subclasses among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and possibly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to its above-described usefulness in the prognostic evaluation, the LB score may bring new insights into the understanding of evolution patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We used the combination of the B score and chromosome complexity to define four classes which may be considered four possible states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and which describe two distinct evolutional pathways </plain></SENT>
