<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After the accident that took place on 26 April 1986 at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, hundreds of thousands of cleanup workers were involved in emergency measures and decontamination activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the framework of an epidemiological study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and other related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> among Ukrainian cleanup workers, individual bone marrow doses have been estimated for 572 cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because dose records were available for only about half of the study subjects, a time-and-motion method of dose reconstruction that would be applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects, whether dead or alive, was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The doses were calculated in a stochastic mode, thus providing estimates of uncertainties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arithmetic mean individual bone marrow doses were found to range from 0.00004 to 3,300 mGy, with an average value of 87 mGy over the 572 study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The uncertainties, characterized by the geometric standard deviation of the probability distribution of the individual dose, varied from subject to subject and had a median value of about 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results should be treated as preliminary; it is likely that the dose calculations and particularly the uncertainty estimates will be improved in the follow-up of this effort </plain></SENT>
