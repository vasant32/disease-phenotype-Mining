<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed by flow cytometry the expression of several members of the Bcl-2 family in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 168 MDS samples at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteins studied were Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (anti-apoptotic), Bax, Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS (pro-apoptotic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of BMMNC expressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS were detected in a higher percentage of cells in RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were associated with an increased Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was also correlated with that of CD34 and P170 and with the percentage of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-color analyses demonstrated that CD34 and Bcl-2 were usually expressed in the same cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found with cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins (Bak, Bad, Bcl-xS) and higher Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio were associated with longer survival and decreased risk of leukemic transformation in univariate analysis, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently Bcl-2 proteins expression was well correlated with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is deregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the study of markers such as CD34 (or Bcl-2), Bcl-xL, and Bcl-xS provides additional prognostic information </plain></SENT>
