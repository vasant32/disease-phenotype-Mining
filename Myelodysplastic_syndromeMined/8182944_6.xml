<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we looked for abnormalities of the NF1 gene by Southern analysis in 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and eight cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, using cDNA probes covering the whole coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 (i.e. had lost one allele of the NF1 gene, situated in 17q11-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither rearrangement nor deletion was found in any patient, suggesting that gross abnormalities of the NF1 gene must be very rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This does not exclude the possibility of more subtle abnormalities, such as point mutations, in some cases </plain></SENT>
