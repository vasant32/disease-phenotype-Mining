<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical records of 70 patients seen at our hospital between 1976 and 1998 and diagnosed as suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) were reviewed in order to confirm the validity of the classification into two forms of disease that the French-American-British Co-operative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>Leukaemia</z:mpath> Group (FAB) proposed in 1994: myelodysplastic (MD) and myeloproliferative (MP), depending on the peripheral white blood cell count (WBC) (less or more than 13 x 10(9)/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the rejection of incomplete records and lost to follow up patients, our study population consisted of 49 records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that, even though this classification is useful in order to separate two classes of patients, it is not enough to predict the prognosis in an accurate manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lot of studies have tried to find some prognostic factors, but the results have been discordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis of our group of patients showed three prognostic factors: serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;1.5 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, blasts in bone marrow &gt;5%, and peripheral blood leukocytes &gt;10 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second multivariate analysis led us to distinguish two groups: high risk (2-3 risk factors) and low risk (0-1 risk factors) (median survival 7 and 44 months, respectively) with a very high statistic significance (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This score should be applied to other series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients in order to confirm its validity </plain></SENT>
