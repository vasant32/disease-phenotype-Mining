<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old male was admitted to our hospital in June 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) was based on the peripheral blood and bone marrow findings on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> and bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was noted, the patient was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although complete remission could not be achieved, a high quality of life could be maintained by appropriate transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In January 1993, the patient was readmitted because of a marked increase in mature neutrophils, showing a moderate increase of blasts, chromosomal aberration (46,XY,12p-) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>; but no <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of bone marrow was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that neoplastic proliferation at the level more differentiated to granulocytic lineage occurred at the terminal stage and that his clinical feature was located between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
