<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) mainly occur in the elderly but can affect younger individuals too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter require special consideration to identify suitable candidates for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, a potentially curative approach carrying a high risk of treatment-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the largest series of young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as yet, including 232 patients younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their clinical characteristics and prognosis are compared with 2,496 patients older than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival was significantly longer in the younger versus older age group (40 v 23 months, respectively; P &lt; .00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference arose from patients belonging to the low- and intermediate-I-risk categories of the International Prognostic Scoring System (median survival not reached v 45 months, respectively; P &lt; .00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, survival was identical for both age groups (8 months for both younger and older patients; P = .81) in the intermediate-II-and high-risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Established classification systems and risk scores were applicable to young patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a particularly large difference in median survival time was seen between the intermediate-I-and intermediate-II-risk groups (176 v 8 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For low-risk patients, the overall survival rate was more than 86% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to these results, aggressive treatment approaches should rarely be recommended to younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients belonging to the low and intermediate-I risk groups </plain></SENT>
