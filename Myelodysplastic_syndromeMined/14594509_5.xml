<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this methodological study, we describe an assay for analysis of proliferative T cell responses in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe treatment-induced cytopenia is observed in patients with malignant disorders who receive conventional intensive chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quantitative T cell defect can then be characterized by flow cytometric analysis of membrane molecule expression, whereas the functional status of the remaining T cell population is more difficult to evaluate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe a standardized whole blood assay that requires small sample volumes and can be used for repeated analysis even in severely ill patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on the following strategy: (i) blood samples are diluted with the serum-free medium X-vivo 10, (ii) T cells are activated either with monoclonal immunoglobulin E (IgE) anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28; (iii) T cell proliferation is assayed by [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation after 4 days of in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These proliferative responses are not affected by the plasma levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), sIL-2-R alpha, IL-7 and IL-15, and the kinetics of the response are not altered by the presence of exogenous cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detectable proliferation is observed for most patients with treatment-induced cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the assay can be used for functional characterization of remaining T lymphocytes in patients with severe T <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
