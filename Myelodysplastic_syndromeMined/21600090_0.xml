<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA) in combination with low dose chemotherapy on intermediate and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 41 patients with intermediate (34) and high-risk (7) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 19 patients received low dose chemotherapy regimen and 22 received low dose chemotherapy plus VPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low dose chemotherapy regimen included: homoharringtonine, 1 - 2 mg×m(-2)×d(-1) intravenously, 14 - 28 d; aclarubicin, 5 - 7 mg×m(-2)×d(-1) intravenously, 1 - 8 d, 15 - 23 d; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 15 mg/m(2) subcutaneously once every 12 h, 14 - 21 d; and subcutaneously use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 200 µg·m(-2)×d(-1) when neutrophil deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome and adverse effect were recorded after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate in the low dose chemotherapy regimen group was 47.4% (9/19), 6 patients (31.6%) achieved complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate in the VPA group was 77.2% (17/22), 9 patients (40.9%) achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate of the low dose chemotherapy in combination with VPA group was significantly higher than that in the low dose chemotherapy group (P &lt; 0.05) while no difference was found in CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adverse effect of the low dose chemotherapy in combination with VPA regimen was tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With acceptable adverse effect, the low dose chemotherapy in combination with VPA regimen is effective for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
