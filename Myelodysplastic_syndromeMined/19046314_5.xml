<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore deviation of T cell subsets and its relationship to marrow cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, measurement of helper-T (Th)/cytotoxic-T (Tc) subsets as well as the deviation situation within this two subsets (Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2) in marrow was performed by flow cytometry from 39 MDS patients and 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interferon (INF)-gamma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha in marrow serum was simultaneously detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of marrow cells was demonstrated by TUNEL (TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that Th and Tc subsets were unevenly activated, both deviating to type I response, which was especially obvious in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (according to WHO classification) and in lower-risk cases defined by International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Level of INF-gamma/TNF-alpha in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow serum was markedly elevated, and so did the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although type I deviation was observed both in Th and Tc subsets, just Th1 cell percentage showed positive correlation with level of INF-gamma/TNF-alpha and apoptotic index of nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, cytokines level in marrow serum presented positive correlation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then deduced that the increased Th1 cells in marrow may account for nucleated cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> through overproduced proapoptotic cytokines such as INF-gamma and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that type I deviation of T cell subsets may play a role in pantocytopenia in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the deviation pattern may be as a direct and effective parameter to predict response of immunosuppression therapy </plain></SENT>
