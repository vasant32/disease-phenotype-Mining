<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studies the efficacy of donor leukocyte transfusion (DLT) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> in relapse after bone marrow transplantation in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (N = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (N = 25), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (N = 26), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (N = 5), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (N = 2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (N = 1) were treated with transfusions of donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effects were induced by donor leukocyte transfusion in 20 patients (29%) including 3 patients out of 4 (75%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in cytogenetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase relapse, 4 out of 5 (80%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 3 out of 13 (23%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in transformed phase, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, and 4 out of 20 (20%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty two patients (30%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (&gt; or = 2) and 6 out of 73 (8.2%) patients developed fatal GVHD after donor leukocyte transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients relapsed within 6 months after marrow transplantation had a probability of having severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (&gt; or = 2) after DLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen out of 24 (58%) patients with GVL response were re-relapsed thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimal dose of donor leukocytes infused in successfully treated 9 patients without cytoreductive therapy was 2 x 10(7)/kg in total and minimal dose of that in 6 patients with fatal GVHD was 7 x 10(7)/kg in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect of donor leukocyte transfusion was strongest against <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in cytogenetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase and induce a durable complete remission </plain></SENT>
