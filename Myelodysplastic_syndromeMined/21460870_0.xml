<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the safety and effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>+G-CSF (VP+G) to G-CSF alone for PBPC mobilization in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent autologous transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic and Ohio State University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the VP+G group, median total CD34+ cells collected were 9.34 × 10(6) per kg (range 0.97-180.89), with 42% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients having adequate (2 × 10(6) cells per kg) CD 34+ collection after 2 days of apheresis compared with a median in the G-CSF group of 3.83 × 10(6) per kg (range, 0.72-50.38), with only 16% patients having adequate collection after 2 days (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>tMDS/tAML occurred in 15 patients (2.3%) in the VP+G and in 12 patients (3.8%) receiving G-CSF alone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased number of days of apheresis was associated with the risk of tMDS/tAML (hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.30, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Priming regimen was not a significant variable for relapse-free survival or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> significantly improves the effectiveness of mobilization at the cost of an increased incidence of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> though with no mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence of increased incidence of tMDS/tAML in patients receiving VP+G compared with those mobilized with G-CSF alone </plain></SENT>
