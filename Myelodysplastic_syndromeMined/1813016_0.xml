<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Defects in the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-mediated T-lymphocyte activation/proliferation pathway have been implicated as contributing to the compromised immune function observed in patients following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also involved in T-lymphocyte function, we have examined whether phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- or anti-CD3 (OKT3)-activated lymphocytes obtained from patients after allogeneic or autologous BMT are capable of proliferating in response to human recombinant IL-4, and compared these results to those obtained using human recombinant IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes from marrow graft recipients were initially cultured for 3 days in the presence of PHA or OKT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated lymphocytes exhibited little or no proliferation (as assessed by incorporation of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>) following culture for an additional 3 days in the presence of IL-4 or IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for lymphocytes obtained from patients early (less than 4 months) after marrow grafting and those obtained from long-term marrow graft recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> at the time of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymphocytes obtained from healthy individuals proliferated in response to IL-4, as well as to IL-2, following initial activation with PHA or OKT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> equal numbers of CD4 and CD8 cells proliferated after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in BMT patients there was a predominant proliferation of CD8 cells using the same stimulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that defects in the IL-4-mediated T-lymphocyte activation/proliferation pathway may also contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> observed following BMT </plain></SENT>
