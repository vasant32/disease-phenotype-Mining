<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The clinical association between loss of the Y chromosome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) has been debated because both phenomena are related to aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prior publication suggests that loss of the Y chromosome in more than 75% of cells may indicate a clonal phenomenon that could be a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between loss of the Y chromosome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review of cytogenetic reports of 2896 male patients ascertained from 1996 to 2007 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were stratified based on the percentage of cells missing the Y chromosome and were correlated with patients' ages and bone marrow biopsy reports through logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of the Y chromosome was found in 142 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 16 patients demonstrated myeloid disease, with 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 14 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence (P &lt; .05) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was seen only in the group composed of 8 patients with complete loss of the Y chromosome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> karyotyped cells (1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 7 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Loss of the Y chromosome appears to be primarily an age-related phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in individuals in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells on cytogenetic analysis showed loss of the Y chromosome, there was a statistically significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, suggesting that the absence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-dividing cells in a bone marrow analysis may be indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
