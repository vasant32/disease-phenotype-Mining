<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the effectiveness of continuous infusion CBDCA, 300 mg/m2/d x 5 days, as evaluated in nine patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) (seven previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and two treatment-associated ANLL), three ANLL patients in first relapse, six refractory ANLL, and nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (BP-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were considered assessable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 44% (eight complete remissions [CRs], four partial remissions [PRs]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median duration of postchemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was 36 days (range, 18 to 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity was mainly hematologic and nondose-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were rarely seen, and most patients were managed as outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, two had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo>, and one patient showed reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of substantial antileukemic activity and unusual extrahematologic toxicity, CBDCA appears to be an effective second-line agent in the treatment of ANLL and should be considered for upgrading to first-line treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
