<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: About one third of patients requiring allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) would not find a matched sibling or alternative donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic HSCT from matched unrelated and mismatched donors carries an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius) at a median dose of 90 mg/kg body weight as part of a total body irradiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-based conditioning regimen for prevention of serious GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared outcomes of 65 recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated grafts and 194 recipients of HLA-matched unrelated grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mismatches involved one or two loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable in age, graft source, diagnosis, stage of disease, and conditioning regimen, and differed only in dose of ATG administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For matched and mismatched transplants, respectively, there was no significant difference in graft failure (0.5% vs 3%; p = 0.16), in the cumulative incidence of grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (45% vs 35%; p = 0.14) and no difference in overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (42% vs 40%; p = 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years were 55% vs 50% (p = 0.99) and 47% vs 47% (p = 1.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of relapse and TRM at 5 years were 24% vs 25% (p = 0.63), and 29% vs 27% (p = 0.59), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inclusion of ATG-Fresenius in the conditioning regimen permits HSCT from mismatched unrelated donors without excess TRM and GVHD, resulting in identical OS and DFS of recipients of HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched grafts </plain></SENT>
