<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells has proven to be of help in the diagnostic workup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the usefulness of flow cytometry for the detection of megakaryocytic and platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate by flow cytometry the diagnostic and prognostic value of platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the pattern of expression of distinct surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> on peripheral blood platelets from a series of 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, 20 healthy subjects and 19 patients with platelet alterations associated to disease conditions other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative expression of CD31, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD41b, CD42a, CD42b and CD61 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> together with the PAC-1, CD62-P, fibrinogen and CD63 platelet activation-associated markers and platelet light scatter properties were systematically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, flow cytometry identified multiple immunophenotypic abnormalities on platelets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients, including altered light scatter characteristics, over-and under expression of specific platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> and asynchronous expression of CD34; decreased expression of CD36 (n = 5), CD42a (n = 1) and CD61 (n = 2), together with reactivity for CD34 (n = 1) were only observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases, while other alterations were also found in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the overall platelet alterations detected for each patient, an immunophenotypic score was built which identified a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients with a high rate of moderate to severe alterations (score&gt;1.5; n = 16) who more frequently showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and high-risk disease, together with a shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the presence of altered phenotypes by flow cytometry on platelets from around half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If confirmed in larger series of patients, these findings may help refine the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of this group of disorders </plain></SENT>
