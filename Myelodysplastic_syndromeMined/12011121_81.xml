<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-one patients (mean age, 67.5 years; 69% male) were randomized to receive either Aza C (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneous for 7 days every 4 weeks) or supportive care, with supportive care patients crossing over to Aza C upon disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was assessed by centrally conducted telephone interviews at baseline and days 50, 106, and 182 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall quality of life, psychological state, and social functioning were assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients on the Aza C arm experienced significantly greater improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (EORTC, P =.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (EORTC, P =.0014), physical functioning (EORTC, P =.0002), positive affect (MHI, P =.0077), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> (MHI, P =.015) over the course of the study period than those in the supportive care arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Particularly striking were improvements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and psychological state (MHI) in patients treated with Aza C compared with those receiving supportive care for patients who remained on study through at least day 106, corresponding to four cycles of Aza C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the two groups in quality of life were maintained even after controlling for the number of RBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improved quality of life for patients treated with Aza C coupled with significantly greater treatment response and delayed time to transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with patients on supportive care (P &lt;.001) establishes Aza C as an important treatment option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
