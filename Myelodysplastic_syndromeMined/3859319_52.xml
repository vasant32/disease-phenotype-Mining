<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The criteria for diagnosis of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), acquired idiopathic sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AISA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) were clearly defined, since the inclusion criteria provided by the FAB co-operative group are imprecise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these patients has received chemotherapy during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the whole group was only 15 months, with less than 10% of the patients surviving after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (17.6%) were still alive at time of analysis, 31 (36.5%) have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and only one of them is still alive; 30 (35.3%) died of infectious and/or haemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had a shorter survival (median survival time 9.5 versus 15 months) but this difference was not significant (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors with prognostic value are in order of significance: abnormal localized immature myeloid precursors (= ALIP) in the trephine biopsy, circulating myeloblasts, excess of blasts in the bone marrow smears, age, FAB classification and granulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt), patients with RA and AISA had a lower incidence of evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (11% versus 56%), but a higher mortality rate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (59.2% versus 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ALIP negative cases were only found among patients with RA and AISA, whereas ALIP positivity was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and RAEBt, in 10/11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and in almost half the cases of RA and AISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In RA and AISA patients survival was significantly different between ALIP positive and ALIP negative cases (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, ALIP negative cases developed significantly less <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than ALIP positive cases (5% versus 44%), but a similar percentage of mortality from infectious and/or haemorrhagic complications was seen in both groups (33% versus 36.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis proved to be of no significant prognostic value, although a trend for shorter survival was observed in patients with complex karyotype anomalies or without mitoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of their prolonged survival, antileukaemic chemotherapy is contra-indicated in ALIP negative patients (median survival 50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless they only constitute a minor subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prognosis in ALIP positive patients is poor (median survival 12.5 months); in these patients therapeutic trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs or with inducers of differentiation of myeloid precursor cells seem to be justified </plain></SENT>
