<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the presented work is the analysis of 40 allogenic bone marrow transplantations in children made in 1989-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow transplantation was made in 40 children (26 boys and 14 girls), mean age 10.5 years (range 1.5-17.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in 11, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> in 10, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> in 6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 2, aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 7, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 2 and inborn errors in 2 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donor was in 33 patients in HLA identical sibling and in seven instances a monozygotic twin, HLA non-identical sibling or relative or unrelated matched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow engraftment was achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients, in one instance the bone marrow was rejected (2.5%) and in four patients (10%) early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred before the bone marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Aug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>15, 1995 20 patients (50%) survived, a relapse developed in 7 (17.5%) and 13 patients died in conjunction with the transplantation (32.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were infectious complications (9 children) either in conjunction with the development of graft versus host reaction (6x) or without signs of this reaction (3x) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> 24x <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> was used, 16x with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The greatest problem are infectious (<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and mycotic) complications in the phase of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> before engraftment of the transplanted bone marrow or in conjunction with a graft versus host reaction which cannot be completely avoided by preventive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplantation is also in children an effective therapeutic method of some forms of malignant haematopoietic diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The correct indication, suitable donor, preventive measures against the graft versus host reaction and protection against infectious complications are essential for the success of this pretentious treatment </plain></SENT>
