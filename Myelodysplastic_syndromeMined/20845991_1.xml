<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the impact on patients' survival of several phenotypic aberrancies detected by a small 4-color panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the patients (54) was made by WHO criteria using peripheral blood counts, bone marrow (BM) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was performed at diagnosis, and features obtained were compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM (24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could detect 16 alterations: 4 in granulocytic precursors, 4 in monocytes, 6 in CD34+ cells, beside changes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and basophil precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> was higher (median 8) than in cases with of abnormalities) were independent risk factors for a shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our panel was sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and permitted to detect independent prognostic features </plain></SENT>
