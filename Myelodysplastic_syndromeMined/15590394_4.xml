<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), may respond to treatment with hematopoietic growth factors (GF)); erythropoietin (Epo) +/- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess whether functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> may develop in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients receiving these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Erythrocyte scattergrams from 34 patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (untreated, transfused, or GF-treated with partial or complete erythroid response) were analyzed with Bayer-Advia equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, the proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes (Hypo-e, median 6.2%, range 1.1-8%) and hypochromic reticulocytes (Hypo-r, median 45%, range 22-48%), as well as mean corpuscular volume (MCV, median 101 fL) were significantly elevated compared to corresponding values in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These values increased further after GF-treatment (median 11%, 57%, and 105 fL, respectively), in spite of improved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values and adequate body iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values observed in untreated RA patients largely fell within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, and there was no significant influence of GF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content of reticulocytes (MCHr) did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls, and was not influenced by GF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The red cell population in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> shows morphological abnormalities in terms of varying but overall <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp>, and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of abnormal cells increases after successful pro-erythroid GF treatment, indicating that GF promote erythroblast survival, and maturation into erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, the finding of hypochromic red cells should not routinely be interpreted as a marker for Epo-induced functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
