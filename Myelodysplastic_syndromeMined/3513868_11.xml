<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These vitamins caused increased proliferation in vitro of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clonogenic marrow myeloid precursor cells (CFU-GM), <z:mp ids='MP_0008973'>decreased erythroid precursors</z:mp> (BFU-E), and no change in multipotent stem cells (CFU-GEMM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marrow hemopoietic colony-forming cell incidence was generally subnormal in the 22 MDS patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro exposure to both agents caused various patterns of alteration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hemopoietic colony and cluster formation, with similar but more pronounced effects evoked by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vast majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, enhanced marrow clonal granulocyte-monocyte differentiation and decreased BFU-E growth were noted after in vitro exposure to these vitamins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation of biological effects was demonstrated between in vivo changes of peripheral neutrophil counts and in vitro responses of myeloid precursors for ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with an eight-week therapeutic course of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses indicated persisting <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or coexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aneuploid karyotypes in the cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> myeloid cells and (with one exception) in native marrow cells from the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The varying responses of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells may monitor differing proportions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus leukemic marrow cells susceptible to proliferative and differentiative expression on exposure to these agents </plain></SENT>
