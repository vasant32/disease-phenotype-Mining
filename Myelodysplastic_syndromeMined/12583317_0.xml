<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients, 27 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, were studied in order to identify disease-specific aberrations, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 using both traditional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using alphoid-satellite centromeric specific probes, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 indicating the progression of the disease and poor prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 21 of 34 cases both methods led to the same results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients fluorescence in situ hybridization making possible to examine a great number of cells, provided more information about the gain and loss of chromosomes above and clarified uncertain cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, studied by the authors, fluorescence in situ hybridization proved a useful and sensitive method to determine chromosomes unrecognized or not accurately identified by the traditional cytogenetic analysis and to define the ratio of pathological cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time the results confirm that conventional cytogenetic analysis is still essential in diagnosing the genetic alterations of malignant cells and point at the chromosomes that are worth further studying by other methods </plain></SENT>
