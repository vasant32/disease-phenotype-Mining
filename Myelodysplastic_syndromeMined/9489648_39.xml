<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 600 patients from 50 European centers have now been reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 131 patients reported to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>Chronic Leukemia</z:hpo> Working Party of the EBMT who underwent BMT from HLA-identical siblings without prior remission induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of BMT 46 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts, 67 patients had more advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes and 18 patients had progressed to sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire group of patients was 34 and 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients died from transplant-related complications, most commonly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in 28 patients between 1 and 33 months after BMT, resulting in an actuarial probability of relapse of 39% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DFS and OS were dependent on pretransplant bone marrow blast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T and sAML had a 5-year DFS of 52, 34, 19 and 26%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS for the respective patient groups was 57, 42, 24 and 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, younger age, shorter disease duration, and absence of excess of blasts were associated with improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> who have appropriate marrow donors, especially those aged less than 40 years and those with low medullary blast cell count should be treated with BMT as the primary treatment early in the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transplantation early after establishing the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may improve prognosis due to a lower treatment-related mortality and a lower relapse risk </plain></SENT>
