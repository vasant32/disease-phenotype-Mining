<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATG treatment resulted in profound systemic complement activation which led to a decrease in the levels of native C3 and C4 to 65% and 40%, respectively, of the original levels on day 5 and of C6 and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> to 61% and 23%, respectively, on day 10 </plain></SENT>
