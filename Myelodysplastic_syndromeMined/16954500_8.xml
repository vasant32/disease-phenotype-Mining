<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that marrow stromal cells induce the expression of MMP-9 in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction was contact independent and could be reproduced with recombinant <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2, whereas IL-6, M-CSF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-8/CXCL8, SDF-1/CXCL12, and MGSA/CXCL1 did not have this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stroma-induced levels of MMP-9 in the monocyte population from healthy donors were relatively consistent, whereas induced levels varied significantly (P &lt; .001) in the CD14+ population from 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with a clonal chromosomal marker, the level of inducible MMP-9 expression in the monocyte population was inversely correlated with the percentage of marker-positive cells (n = 11, P = .01), suggesting that the ability to induce MMP-9 may be compromised in clonally derived monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inducible levels of MMP-9 were also inversely correlated with marrow cellularity observed in biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that monocytes can express MMP-9 in response to stromal factors and that this response may be significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived monocytes </plain></SENT>
