<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with clonal lymphoid aggregates in the bone marrow but without evidence of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case of a 71-year-old man was evaluated for cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His bone marrow was initially hypocellular, with 10% blasts and a few small lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease progressed gradually, and he received erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two months later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (M1) developed, with 60% to 70% blasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow also showed large aggregates of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study of these cells in the nodular lesions showed 50% CD3+ and 50% CD20+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and T- and B-cell clonal gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization study with centromere-specific probes of a bone marrow specimen showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in both nodular lymphoid lesions and surrounding bone marrow cells, indicating that both processes originated from the same abnormal pluripotential progenitor </plain></SENT>
