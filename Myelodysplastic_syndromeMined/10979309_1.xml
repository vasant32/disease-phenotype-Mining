<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the expression of TNF alpha on the bone marrow trephine biopsies by immunohistochemical method and the TNF alpha production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by ELISA method in 15 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of seven patients without excess of blasts showed high or intermediate TNF alpha expression in the bone marrow biopsies, whereas two patients with excess of blasts were negative and one had low expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients revealed low or intermediate expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production of TNF alpha by the PBMC was analysed in 10 patients, four patients with RA and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> produced higher level of TNF alpha which increased after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> myristic <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, but none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients revealed increase in TNF alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion we suppose that increased TNF alpha expression and production by PBMC may be a further indirect evidence of the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, in the course of progression the cytokine expression and production decreases </plain></SENT>
