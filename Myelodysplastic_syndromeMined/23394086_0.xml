<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MDSs are predominant in the elderly with an incidence of 20/100000 at 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, a majority of patients are not eligible for this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, remains the primary treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which leads to a significant increase in overall survival (OS), although it is not curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it is well known that the impairment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation are important features of this complex disease, the implication of autophagy in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is an emerging concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another significant advance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis research is the recent identification of mutations in genes encoding transcription factors implicated in hematopoiesis and proteins involved in splicing (SF3B1), methylation (DNMT3A), regulation of methylation (TET2 and IDH), DNA conformation (EZH2 and ASXL1) and differentiation (N- and K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, BCL2 family member expression and regulation may also affect the physiopathology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that targeting autophagy may be an interesting option for the treatment of AZA-resistant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, targeting the products of the above-mentioned genes or the signaling pathways affected by the corresponding proteins may be of great interest for the development of a new arsenal of molecules to fight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the new aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> physiopathology and how recent advances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis research may impact future treatments to improve the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
