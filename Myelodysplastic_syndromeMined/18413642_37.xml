<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Marrow failure in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) responds to immunosuppressive treatment (IST), but long-term outcome after IST has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with IST at our institution to determine their clinical course compared with a comparable supportive care only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received IST with a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 0.03 to 11.3 years), using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) in combination or singly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables affecting response and survival were studied and outcomes were compared with those of 816 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reported to the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> Risk Analysis Workshop (IMRAW) who received only supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine (30%) of 129 patients receiving IST responded either completely or partially: 18 (24%) of 74 patients responded to ATG, 20 (48%) of 42 patients responded to ATG plus CsA, and one (8%) of 13 patients responded to CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent (12 of 39) of the responses were complete, resulting in transfusion independence and near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, younger age was the most significant factor favoring response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other favorable factors affecting response were HLA-DR15 positivity and combination ATG plus CsA treatment (P = .001 and P = .048, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of the combined IMRAW and IST cohorts, younger age, treatment with IST, and intermediate or low International Prognostic Scoring System score significantly favored survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IST produced significant improvement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> of a substantial proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and was associated with improved overall and progression-free survival, especially in younger individuals with lower-risk disease </plain></SENT>
