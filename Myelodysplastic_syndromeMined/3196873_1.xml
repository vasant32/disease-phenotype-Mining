<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were chosen for study if there were a clinical suggestion of in vivo maturation and a leukemic clone exhibiting a distinguishable karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mature peripheral blood granulocytes were enriched by two-step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation and fused with mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells to induce the formation of prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These PCC were then analyzed for chromosome number per cell (in the case of patients with a numerical abnormality) or by G-banding (in the case of specific translocations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients chosen for study, 12 showed karyotypic evidence for maturation of the abnormal elements in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maturation was observed in a number of clinical situations including before treatment in benign <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, after low-dose and high-dose chemotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the technique of premature chromosome condensation can be a powerful tool in better understanding the biology of disease and mode of response to therapy in vivo in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukemic syndromes</z:e>, especially during treatment with agents thought to induce maturation of the leukemic elements </plain></SENT>
