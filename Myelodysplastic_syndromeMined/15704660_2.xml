<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The advancement of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation techniques and the increase in frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> in older patients are expected to expand the indications to include more elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the problem of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in patients over 40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 21 consecutive patients (13 males and 8 females) over 40 years old who underwent allo-BMT at our center during the past 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 46 years, and 5 patients were over 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 5 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival rate was 43.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was associated with recovery of platelets in less than 30 days and recovery of neutrophil counts in less than 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) or regimen-related toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients died of transplantation-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A faster recovery of the neutrophil and platelet counts was significantly associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreasing transplantation-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, particularly by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> control, in allo-BMT in patients over age 40 is an important problem </plain></SENT>
