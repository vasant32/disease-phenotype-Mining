<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: Among them, 22 patients survived for less than 1 year: 10 of these had complex chromosomal abnormalities (complex aberrations), but only 5 of the remaining 75 patients who survived longer than 12 months did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> did not develop in approximately half of the patients who died within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence rate of leukemic transformation appears to depend on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes rather than cytogenetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percentage of patients who survived for less than 1 year is related to chromosomal changes, especially to complex aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest in this study is that 7 of 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> survived for less than 1 year, and 5 of 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> were included in this group showing a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By hematologic analysis, significant differences were found in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values and platelet counts of patients who survived for less than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis, three major risk factors for a poor prognosis were identified: complex aberrations, a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>), and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival probability in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> having at least one of these three factors was significantly low when compared with that in patients without these factors, indicating that cytogenetic analysis in combination with observance of certain clinical manifestations is important in therapeutic management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
