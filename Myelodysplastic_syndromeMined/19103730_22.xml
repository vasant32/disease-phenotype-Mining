<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied bone marrow (BM) histologic abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) classified according to WHO criteria to determine their clinical correlates and prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred one consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated for BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and CD34 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was assessed following the European consensus guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to severe BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was detected in 17% of cases and was associated with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = .001), high transfusion requirement (P &lt; .001), and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cell clusters were found in 23% of patients and were associated with WHO categories with excess of blasts (P &lt; .001) and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and presence of CD34+ cell clusters had independent negative impact on overall survival (P &lt; .001 and P = .019, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (P &lt; .001 and P = .004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A hierarchical clustering analysis identified three subsets of patients with distinct clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One cluster consisted mainly of patients with BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and high transfusion requirement; these individuals had lower overall survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (P = .001 and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within patients stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System and WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System categories, BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> involved a shift to a one-step more advanced risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> identifies a distinct subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high transfusion requirement, and poor prognosis and represents an independent prognostic factor that may be useful in clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of CD34+ cell clusters is an independent risk factor for progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
