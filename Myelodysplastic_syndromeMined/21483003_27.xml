<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred thirty-three patients (median age, 70 years; range, 60 to 90 years) were enrolled; 53% had poor-risk cytogenetics, and the median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration at random assignment was 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> (15 mg/m(2)) was given intravenously over 4 hours three times a day for 3 days in 6-week cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OS prolongation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus BSC was not statistically significant (median OS, 10.1 v 8.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.17; two-sided, log-rank P = .38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) -free survival (AMLFS), was significantly prolonged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus BSC (median PFS, 6.6 v 3.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88; P = .004; median AMLFS, 8.8 v 6.1 months, respectively; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.12; P = .24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation was significantly (P = .036) reduced at 1 year (from 33% with BSC to 22% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses indicated that patients with short <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration had worse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Best responses with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus BSC, respectively, were as follows: complete response (13% v 0%), partial response (6% v 0%), hematologic improvement (15% v 2%), stable disease (14% v 22%), progressive disease (29% v 68%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (14% v 0%), and inevaluable (8% v 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 to 4 febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 25% of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus 7% of patients on BSC; grade 3 to 4 infections occurred in 57% and 52% of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and BSC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> treatment was associated with improvements in patient-reported quality-of-life (QOL) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> administered in 6-week cycles is active in older patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, resulting in improvements of OS and AMLFS (nonsignificant), of PFS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation (significant), and of QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Short <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration was an independent adverse prognosticator </plain></SENT>
