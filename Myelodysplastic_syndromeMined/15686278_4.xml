<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were scheduled for bone marrow transplantation: 12 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients were scheduled to undergo peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: 20 had malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with platelet counts of &lt; or = 50,000/mm3 who required tooth extraction and those with platelet counts of &lt; or = 30,000 /mm3 who required scaling received platelet transfusions before the dental treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We saw no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> problems in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dental care for patients who had neutrophil counts of &gt; or = 500/mm3 included tooth extractions or scaling, with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even those with severe immunosuppression (neutrophil count: 100-150/mm3) tolerated treatment when prophylactic measures, such as intravenous administration of antibiotics, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with a neutrophil count of &lt; or = 50/mm3 developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after even conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, caution should be exercised when treating patients scheduled for HSCT as even conservative therapy can initiate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
