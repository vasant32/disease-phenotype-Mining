<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two abnormal unrelated clones were detected, one of them had 5q-, 7q- with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of an additional aberration, t(12;13); in the second clone there was a translocation between the two homologues of chromosome 1 as the only aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the clone with 5q- and 7q- represented the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> cells, whereas the abnormal clone with t(1;1) represented the plasmablasts of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
