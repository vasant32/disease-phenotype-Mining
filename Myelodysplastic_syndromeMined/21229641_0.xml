<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: to evaluate the biological and clinical significance of circulating CD34(+) cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the relative count of CD34(+) cells in peripheral blood was evaluated by flow cytometry and the results were recorded on the total number of mononuclear cells (MNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) status was correlated with the percentage of circulating and bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic studies, CFU-GM colony growth, overall survival and transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the number of MNC positive for anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody in the healthy control group ranged from 0.00% to 0.73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cutoff value for overexpression of CD34 antigen on peripheral blood MNC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was â‰¥ 1% (CD34(+) cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of circulating CD34(+) MNCs in 30 MDS patients was significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of circulating CD34(+) MNCs did not correlate with the blast count in the peripheral blood (r=0.282, p=0.131), neither with the blast count in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow CD34(+) cells (r=0.461, p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells did not correspond to the percentage of blast count in the bone marrow, neither with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities or abnormal growth of GM-progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median actuarial survival of 19 patients with elevated proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells was 16 months, as compared to &gt;57 months in 11 patients with CD34(+) cells within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (p=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients with elevated proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as compared to only one of CD34(-)negative (CD34(-)) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the presence of circulating CD34(+) cells is a common finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but no significant correlations with clinical and/or biological features of the disease have been found </plain></SENT>
