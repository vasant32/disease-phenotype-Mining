<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH detected -7/7q- in 5.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of -7/7q- was associated with shorter overall survival than absence of such aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that FISH 7q could be beneficial in patients with intermediate WHO morphologic risk stratification and no evidence of -7/7q- by CC </plain></SENT>
