<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with maturation (M2) patients with a high maturation index (M2a) were older, compared to the other myeloblastic subgroups, while promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (M3) patients were younger than those with M2 or M2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences between various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> types were found in the occurrence of a preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, leukocyte count, and platelet count </plain></SENT>
