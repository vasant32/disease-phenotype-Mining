<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 68 years (range 65-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent of patients had a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index of &gt;2 at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative nonrelapse mortality was 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4-17] at 26 months and the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 61% (95% CI 49-71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, disease status at transplant and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> were significant predictors for OS (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity index of &gt;2 did not impact OS but did predict for higher risk of developing grade 3-5 toxicity (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> after transplantation (cumulative incidence 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> who are &gt;65 years of age should be considered transplant candidates, particularly if they have chemosensitive disease and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LDH levels at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with comorbidity index of &gt;2 can also undergo transplantation with acceptable outcomes but may be at higher risk for developing toxicity </plain></SENT>
