<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who have the 5q deletion (del[5q]) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (interstitial deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 5) have complete clinical and cytogenetic remissions in response to lenalidomide treatment, but they often have relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the persistence of rare but distinct malignant stem cells accounts for such relapses, we examined bone marrow specimens obtained from seven patients with the del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who became transfusion-independent while receiving lenalidomide treatment and entered cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD34+, CD38+ progenitor cells and stem cells that were positive for CD34 and CD90, with undetectable or low CD38 (CD38âˆ’/low), had the 5q deletion before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although lenalidomide efficiently reduced these progenitors in patients in complete remission, a larger fraction of the minor, quiescent, CD34+,CD38-/low, CD90+ del(5q) stem cells as well as functionally defined del(5q) stem cells remained distinctly resistant to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over time, lenalidomide resistance developed in most of the patients in partial and complete remission, with recurrence or expansion of the del(5q) clone and clinical and cytogenetic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with the del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, we identified rare and phenotypically distinct del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> stem cells that were also selectively resistant to therapeutic targeting at the time of complete clinical and cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
