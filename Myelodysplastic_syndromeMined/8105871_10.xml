<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly changed expression of the complement receptors 1 (CD35) and 3 (CD11b), the Fc gamma receptor I (CD64), the leucocyte-homing receptor (CD44) and the activation associated membrane proteins CD67 and M5 were found on monocytes and/or granulocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
