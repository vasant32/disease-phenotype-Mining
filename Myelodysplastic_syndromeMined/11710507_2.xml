<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and it has been attributed either to a deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO) secretion or to a resistance to EPO itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since in healthy subjects the serum circulating EPO levels fluctuate during the day, the aim of the study was to investigate the diurnal rhythm of EPO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of subjects were admitted to the study: (A) 20 adult clinically healthy subjects, and (B) 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After standard life conditions in hospital lasting one week, venous blood samples were drawn during the span of a whole day and every four hours, starting from midnight, for the measurement of serum EPO levels by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was carried out by means of the "cosinor" method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that the controls present a significant (p &lt; 0.05) circadian rhythms in serum EPO levels with acrophase in the late afternoon; on the contrary, no significant (p &gt; 0.05) rhythm was detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presented significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) MESOR and lower (p &lt; 0.001) amplitude of EPO circadian rhythm in respect to the controls; moreover, a significant (p &lt; 0.005) difference was found between the two groups in overall EPO rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the existence of a physiological circadian rhythm in serum EPO concentrations with maximum in the afternoon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because EPO levels are increased in the patient group, EPO deficiency does not seem to be the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced EPO amplitude may be a compensatory mechanism for enhancing its activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the stimulatory therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with recombinant human EPO should be administered in the late afternoon hours, in order to respecting and simulating the physiological circadian rhythm of endogenous EPO </plain></SENT>
