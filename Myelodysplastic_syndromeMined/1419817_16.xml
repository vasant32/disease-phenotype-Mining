<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinicomorphological features in 33 cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> classified according to the FAB classification which presented to a single centre over a 12 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presenting features were typically related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> were far more prevalent than in the adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological assessment of the peripheral blood and the bone marrow showed seven patients had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 13 patients had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), nine patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) and four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall mean survival was short (9.9 months) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subgroups and the leukaemic transformation rate was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients scored 0-1 according to the Bournemouth Scoring System; four patients scored 2 whereas 29 patients scored 3 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that unlike adults, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in children run an aggressive clinical course, irrespective of the FAB subtype, and the pathogenesis of these diseases in paediatric practice warrants scientific scrutiny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intensive chemotherapy such as the one used in de novo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> lead to complete remission in some children and these early results suggest that this should be the treatment of choice in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
