<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a single center, retrospective, cohort study of consecutive adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 2006 and July 1, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included patients undergoing induction or first relapse combination chemotherapy who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> 200 mg orally twice daily as prophylaxis during the neutropenic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient records were evaluated until 30 days after neutrophil recovery for development of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (IFI) as defined per EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria with computed tomography scans independently reviewed by a radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic drug monitoring and reasons for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> discontinuation were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty four episodes of IFI were detected among 165 consecutive patients for an overall incidence of 145 per 1000 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IFI was 24, 42, and 78 per 1000 patients for proven, probable, and possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed proven IFI (n = 2 Aspergillus spp., n = 2 Rhizopus spp.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> trough concentrations were available in 39 patients, and no statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> trough level was observed between those with versus without an IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> prophylaxis was discontinued in 81 patients due to suspected IFI (n = 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin (n = 19), adverse events (n = 23), and other causes (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
