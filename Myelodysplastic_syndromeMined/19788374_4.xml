<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to explore whether the BM stroma progenitors, namely the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are primarily affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by evaluating the reserves, the functional properties, as well as the cytogenetic characteristics, in comparison to BM hematopoietic cells, in patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number, differentiation potential toward adipocytes/chondrocytes/osteoblasts and immunosuppressive function in terms of inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced T-cell proliferation did not differ significantly between patient and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 20) MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient MSCs did not show any aberrations in the production of proinflammatory or growth-promoting cytokines and did not harbor the cytogenetic abnormalities present in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occasional patient and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC cultures, however, developed irrelevant chromosomal alterations (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> 5 and 7) with uncertain pathophysiologic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, patient MSCs displayed impaired proliferative and clonogenic potential through passages that might represent a nonspecific abnormality associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory process present in patients' BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that BM MSCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients do not belong to the abnormal clone and do not represent the main cellular source contributing to the inflammatory marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
