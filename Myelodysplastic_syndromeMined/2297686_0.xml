<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> metaphases analyzed revealed an abnormal karyotype with complex defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most prominent defect consisted of a rearrangement of the short arm of chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until now, 6p rearrangements have been preferentially observed in myelodysplastic patients with a history of previous exposure to toxic products such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> or environmental factors of occupational origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although our patient was not exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, for about 20 years he has regularly consumed important quantities of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi>, tranquilizers, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eventual relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e>, as well as the existence of chromosome sites preferentially rearranged in the bone marrow cells of myelodysplastic patients, are discussed </plain></SENT>
