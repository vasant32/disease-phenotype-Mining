<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The overall impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) or pipobroman treatments on the long-term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) has not been assessed in randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report final analyses from the French <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> Study Group (FPSG) study, which randomly assigned HU versus pipobroman as first-line therapy in 285 patients younger than age 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The full methodology has been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FPSG results were updated with a median follow-up of 16.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by using competing risks on the intention-to-treat population and according to main treatment received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median survival was 17 years for the whole cohort, 20.3 years for the HU arm, and 15.4 years for the pipobroman arm (P = .008) and differed significantly from that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10, 15, and 20 years, cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) was 6.6%, 16.5%, and 24% in the HU arm and 13%, 34%, and 52% in the pipobroman arm (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> incidence at 10, 15, and 20 years according to main treatment received was 15%, 24%, and 32% with HU versus 5%, 10%, and 21% with pipobroman (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data from this unique randomized trial comparing HU with another cytoreductive drug in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> showed that (1) survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> treated with conventional agents differed from survival in the general population, (2) evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> is the first cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, (3) pipobroman is leukemogenic and is unsuitable for first-line therapy, and (4) incidence of evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> with HU is higher than previously reported, although consideration should be given to the natural evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
