<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight evaluable patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were randomized to receive a single, daily oral dose of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> (13-CRA, 100 mg/m2) or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued, when possible, for a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Determination of response to treatment was based on clinical course, repeat bone marrow biopsies, and aspirates and blood counts (CBC) with WBC differential, platelet, and reticulocyte numbers at specified intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was noted between the two treatment groups in response to test drug (P = .66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient (3%) in the 13-CRA group and two patients (6%) in the placebo group had a minor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of patients in both groups had progression of their disease, and progression-free survival was nearly identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater than 90% of the patients receiving 13-CRA developed mild or moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> that was reversible with decreasing or discontinuing the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study did not find that 13-CRA exerts a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
