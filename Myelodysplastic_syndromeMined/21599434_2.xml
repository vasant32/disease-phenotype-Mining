<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median duration of chelation treatment was 10.9 months (range 4-24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chelation was effective (maintained or decreased iron stores) in 16 out of 22 patients (73%) with serum ferritin levels &lt;2000 μg/L in contrast to only 12 out of 26 patients with serum ferritin levels &gt;2000 μg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination of L1 with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) (30-40 kU/week) resulted in effective chelation in five additional patients with serum ferritin levels &gt;3000 μg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of adverse effects was comparable to that in thalassemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal symptoms represented the most frequent adverse effect of L1 therapy (37.5% of patients) that limited an effective escalation of the daily dose of the drug and led to discontinuation of the treatment for six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decreased number of granulocytes was observed in five (13%) patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> occurred in two patients (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte counts were restored after cessation of L1 treatment and administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of L1 in a daily dose of at least 75 mg/kg may represent an alternative approach in treatment of mild and moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who cannot be treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (DFRA) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
