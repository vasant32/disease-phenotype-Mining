<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using R-banding karyotypic analysis technique, the bone marrow (BM) cells were performed in 223 hematopoietic malignacies and 105 diopathic throbocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), which served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained: (1) Nonrandom chromosome loss (NCL), such as, -11, -14, -21, etc, which were found in the affected members of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> families, were found in about 30% <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ANLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and about 50% ALL, espedislly in 100% (5/5) CLL, but not found in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the familial nonrandom chromosome loss were associated with leukomogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Because most of BM cells are hypodiploed and have the same kinds of NCL in each cases of CLL, which can develop into ALL, ANLL and also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, ALL BM hypo- and hyper-diploid and/or polyploid cells might be origin of hypodiploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) 28% (6/21) of pediatric patients with AL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, or FA (Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>) have one parent, who have up to 30% BM hypodiploid cells and similar kinds of NCL and also have the rearrangement of C-erbB and abnormal proliferation of BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NCL were found in the three consecutive generations of a family with 5 ALL among 10 members of third generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It indicated that the familial NCL might be inherited and be coded by a unknown gene alteration, which might be related to leukomo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, because there are genes or their candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the chromosomes 11, 14 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) Based on the works of my colleages and I, the model of leukomo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> was proposed and the relationship between chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>, deletion, translocations and leukomogenesis were showed elswhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 11, 14 and 21 etc. were discussed briefly </plain></SENT>
