<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While there are many case reports dealing with ABO mosaicism and chimerism, there have been few attempts to determine the patient's genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood and buccal mucosa were obtained from three persons with ABO mosaicism or chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived colonies and from peripheral blood and buccal mucosa were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, analyses of short tandem repeat markers were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived DNA analysis revealed that, in two of the three persons there were 2 apparently distinct progenitor cell lineages whose percentages were close to those in the peripheral blood of the patients, as analyzed by flow cytometry; the exception was Subject 3, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short tandem repeat analysis showed that the former two subjects had two pairs of ABO alleles and the latter subject, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, had loss of heterozygosity in some colony-derived DNA as well as blood DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had two distinct hematopoietic cell lineages that led to their ABO chimeric status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was assumed to have an ABO mosaicism caused by the somatic deletion of the ABO gene in the hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
