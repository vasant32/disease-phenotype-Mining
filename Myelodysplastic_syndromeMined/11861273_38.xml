<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>Ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> is a common feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a 2-step liquid-culture procedure to study erythropoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) cells from the marrow of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were cultured for 10 days in serum-containing medium with Epo, stem cell factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and steroid hormones until they reached the proerythroblast stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells were then placed in medium containing Epo and insulin for terminal erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numbers of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control cells increased 10(3) fold by day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in semisolid culture, cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) with ringed sideroblasts and RA or RA with excess of blasts produced significantly fewer BFU-Es than cells from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of interphase nuclei from patients with chromosomal defects indicated that abnormal clones were expanded in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epo-signaling pathways (STAT5, Akt, and ERK 1/2) were normally activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> erythroid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells once they differentiated, whereas it remained low in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fas was overexpressed on freshly isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells and on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> erythroid cells throughout the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> coincided with overproduction of Fas ligand during the differentiation stage and was inhibited by Fas-Fc chimeric protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+)-derived erythroid progenitors proliferated normally in our 2-step liquid culture with Epo but underwent abnormal Fas-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during differentiation that could be responsible for the impaired erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
