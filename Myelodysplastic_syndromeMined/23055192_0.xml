<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the methylation status of the p73 gene promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 126 adult patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the MS-PCR were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed p73 expression using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of BM cells was examined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation of the p73 gene was observed in 36.5 % of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were strong correlations between p73 methylation and the marrow blast levels (p  =  0.037) and the WHO classification (p  =  0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p73 methylation was significantly correlated with the International Prognostic Scoring System subgroup ( r  =  0.904, p  &lt;  0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a decrease in the transcription of p73 was accompanied by methylation (p  =  0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the BM samples of the methylated group was not significantly lower than that in the unmethylated group (p  =  0.094), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment restored p73 expression and increased the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (ara-C)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of patients with p73 methylation was shorter than that for patients without p73 methylation (15 vs. &gt; 33 months, respectively, p  =  0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis also indicated that the p73 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p73 methylation is common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and is associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further evidence for the involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
