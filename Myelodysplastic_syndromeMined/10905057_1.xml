<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of response to the treatment was 61%, including 39% with a complete response, which is higher than rates obtained in previous studies in which LDAraC alone was administered to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 23.5 months in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 16.7 months in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, and 19.7 months in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of the study group appeared to be prolonged in comparison with a historical control group of patients treated with LDAraC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that M-CSF added to the administration of LDAraC plays an active role in the therapy </plain></SENT>
