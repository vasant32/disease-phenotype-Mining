<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLL has been shown to be overexpressed in cases with 11q amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in most of the cases, the amplified region is not restricted to the MLL locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> and MLL gain/amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of array CGH performed in 12 patients, we were able to delineate the minimal deleted regions within 5q and 17p and identified three independent regions 11q/I-III that were amplified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiles established in 15 cases were used to identify candidate genes within these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, analysis of our data suggests a correlation of loss of 5q and 17p and expression of genes present in 11q23-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gene expression signature can be used to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> with MLL amplification from several other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
