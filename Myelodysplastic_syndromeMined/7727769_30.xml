<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the 31 male and 19 female patients was 9 years (range 2 to 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 13 patients were serologically matched at HLA-A, B, DR, and DQ with their donors; 6 of these were reactive in mixed lymphocyte culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 37 patients were mismatched for one (36 patients) or more (1 patient) HLA antigens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data compare favorably with published reports for children transplanted with HLA-matched sibling donors and should encourage earlier consideration of unrelated donor BMT in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
