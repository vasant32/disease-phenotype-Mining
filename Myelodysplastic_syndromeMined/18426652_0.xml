<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> were detected by RT-PCR, the expressions of survivin gene in BMMNCs of 55 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> were detected by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression of hTERT significantly elevated in RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients, as compared with controls (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the disease alleviated, the expression of hTERT decreased and had no significant difference from the controls (p&gt;0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in expression of hTERT between low+int-1 risk group and int-2+high-risk group by IPSS (p&gt;0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of survivin gene significantly increased in RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients, as compared with controls (p&lt;0.02, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of survivin gene in low+int-1 risk group by IPSS was significantly higher than that in the controls (p&lt;0.02), and there was no significant difference in expression of survivin gene between int-2+high-risk group patients and the controls (p&gt;0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expressions of hTERT and survivin may play a critical role in escaping malignant clone of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and acquiring the ability to divide unlimitedly </plain></SENT>
