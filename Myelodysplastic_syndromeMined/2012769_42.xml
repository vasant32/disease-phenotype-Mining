<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses of 60 units/kg/d rising to 90 units/kg/d were given over a maximum period of 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two out of 10 patients showed a steady rise in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> had a sustained rise from 9.9 g/dl to 11.3 g/dl, and one patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) had a rise from 9.5 g/dl to 11.4 g/dl but then relapsed with the development of an iron deficient state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of immunoreactive EPO varied considerably between patients, but both responders had relatively low baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both responders were also new diagnoses and had received no red cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The criteria for response to recombinant human erythropoietin therapy, as well as the indications for therapy remain to be clarified </plain></SENT>
