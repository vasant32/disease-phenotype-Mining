<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical work has revealed their ability to effectively inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vitro and in vivo in animal models across a wide range of malignant phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">Myeloid malignancies</z:e> are appropriate disease targets, in that they express relevant biologic targets, such as Ras, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), AKT, and others that may depend upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24017">farnesyl</z:chebi> protein transferase (FTase) activity to promote proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase I trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> have demonstrated biologic and clinical activities as determined by target <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e>, low toxicity, and both complete and partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, phase II trials have been initiated in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and disease settings, in order to further validate clinical activity and to identify downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that these studies will serve to define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and provide insight into effective methods by which to combine FTIs with other agents </plain></SENT>
