<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> spectrum of immunophenotypic abnormalities have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies are restricted to the analysis of CD34(+) cells and/or other major subsets of CD34(-) cells, frequently not exploring the diagnostic and prognostic impact of immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We propose for the first time an immunophenotypic score (IS) based on the altered distribution and immunophenotypic features of maturing/mature compartments of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells in 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that could contribute to a refined diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated phenotypes were detected in reactive BM, the overall immunophenotypic profile of BM cells allowed an efficient discrimination between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive BM, once the number and degree of severity of the abnormalities detected per patient were simultaneously considered in the proposed IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, increasingly higher IS were found among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showing adverse prognostic factors and in low- versus high-grade cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most informative prognostic factors included the number of CD34(+) cells, presence of aberrant CD34(-)/CD117(+) precursors, decreased mature neutrophils and CD34(-) erythroid precursors, and increased numbers of CD36(-/lo) erythroid precursors; in addition, the IS was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of immunophenotypic abnormalities of maturing/mature BM cells allows an efficient discrimination between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive BM, once the number and degree of severity of the abnormalities detected are simultaneously scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, progressively higher IS were found among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with adverse prognostic features and shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
