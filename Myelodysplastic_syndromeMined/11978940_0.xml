<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation, in whom complete remission (CR) was achieved with the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 76-year-old patient was admitted to our hospital with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and a productive cough; a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was thus made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with antibiotics, the patient's condition improved, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was diagnosed from peripheral blood and bone marrow examinations after the patient recovered from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved a sustained haematological CR that was confirmed by morphological and flow cytometric examination after treatment with G-CSF alone, although chromosomal abnormalities persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the literature, in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were reported to achieve CR by G-CSF, the course was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, although our case did not have this complication during the course of G-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that patients with G-CSF alone without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> can achieve CR and that this may be related to a differentiation effect of G-CSF based on persistent chromosomal abnormality in this case </plain></SENT>
