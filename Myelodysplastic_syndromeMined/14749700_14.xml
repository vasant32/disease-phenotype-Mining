<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the fusion of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene to the Syk gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with t(9;12)(q22;p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk fusion transformed interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to growth factor independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the intracellular signal transduction of the stable transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk fusion protein was associated with the p85 subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 3 kinase (PI3-K) followed by the activation of Akt in the absence of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vav, phospholipase C-gamma2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also constitutively activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk also activated the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in the absence of Janus kinase 2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these kinases were phosphorylated in the BaF3 cells transfected with TELDeltaPNT-Syk in which the oligomerization domain of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> was deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitor analysis showed that the MAPK pathway was important in <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk-mediated cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunofluorescence technique revealed that the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk fusion protein was located in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-Syk fusion protein in the cytoplasm leads to the constitutive activation of PI3-K/Akt, MAPK and STAT5 signal pathways, which are closely involved in IL-3-independent cell proliferation of BaF3 cells </plain></SENT>
