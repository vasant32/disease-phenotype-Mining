<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with previously untreated primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts, or refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) were eligible only if they were dependent on erythrocyte transfusion, had a platelet count&lt;50,000/microL, or had an absolute neutrophil count&lt;1000/microL with a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that required antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive oral topotecan either at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2 twice daily for 5 days (Arm A) or once daily for 10 days (Arm B) repeated every 21 days for at least 2 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responding patients continued until they developed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until they had received 2 cycles beyond a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety patients received treatment, including 46 patients on Arm A and 44 patients on Arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial responses with improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cell lines occurred in 6 patients (7%), and hematologic improvement (in 1 or 2 cell lines) was observed in 21 patients (23%), for an overall response rate of 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response duration was longer on Arm A (23 months vs 14 months; P=.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 8 treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
