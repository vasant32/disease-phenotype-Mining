<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sera of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were collected; the level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (S-VEGF) was measured by ELISA; and the microvessel density (MVD) of marrow biopsy specimens was examined with the streptavidine-biovatidine immunoperoxidase method; the count of MVD was evaluated with image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of S-VEGF and count of MVD were higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, and both significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The S-VEGF was positively related with MVD (P&lt;0.05), and S-VEGF and MVD were closely related with the percentage of blast in marrow and in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The result shows that there is <z:mp ids='MP_0000260'>abnormal angiogenesis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow, and the elevated levels of S-VEGF and MVD are closely related with a progressive status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
