<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if the c-kit ligand mast cell growth factor (MGF) can improve progenitor growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we evaluated in vitro responsiveness of bone marrow progenitors from 25 patients to MGF and/or GM-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and PIXY 321, and examined the relationship between progenitor response and cellular expression of the c-kit receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MGF and erythropoietin gave rise to macroscopic colonies and dose-dependently increased CFU-GEMM and BFU-E up to 27-fold in 15 (60%) and 20 (80%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 17 patients with absent growth in lymphocyte-conditioned media, MGF stimulated CFU-GEMM recovery in 59%, compared to 23% with PIXY 321, 12% with IL-3 and 8% with GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokine combinations did not augment recovery of erythropoietin-dependent progenitors above that achieved with MGF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MGF and/or IL-3 were comparatively weak stimulants of CFU-GM formation, whereas GM-CSF and PIXY in combination with MGF increased colony number 2- to 15-fold in 60 and 70% of patients, respectively, while preserving maturation competence as evidenced by colony composition and increased colony/cluster ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effects of MGF were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> morphologic categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> except <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mononuclear cell population expressing the c-kit receptor was identified by flow cytometry in 57% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither SR-1 reactivity nor cytogenetic pattern predicted progenitor response to MGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that MGF improves the colony-forming capacity of hematopoietic progenitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and is a potent co-stimulant of multipotent and committed progenitor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in MGF responsiveness implies an intrinsic defect in growth regulation not explained by cellular loss of c-kit display </plain></SENT>
