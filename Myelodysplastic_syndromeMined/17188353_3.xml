<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the early and terminal maturation of monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (FAB subtypes <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immature MoDC were obtained by culture of monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To obtain mature MoDC, TNF-alpha was added during the final three culture days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell proliferation and T cell cytokine secretion in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) unveiled a strong reduction of allostimulatory capacity of mature but also of immature MoDC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immature MoDC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exhibited an almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunophenotype, but secreted substantially less IL-12 and more IL-10 in response to LPS/IFN-gamma than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Terminal addition of TNF-alpha to GM-CSF/IL-4 treated monocytes failed to extinguish cytokine production by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> MoDC and failed to induce the expected membrane upregulation of costimulatory and other ligands as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While our data provide further support for previous studies that have indicated an impaired differentiation of immature towards mature MoDC, they also clearly demonstrate a qualitatively and quantitatively altered cytokine secretion at the level of immature MoDC, which may in part explain the reduced allostimulatory capacity of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations may contribute to immune modulation of the clinical phenotype of marrow failure in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and may have to be considered when designing DC-based immunotherapeutic strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
