<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferative responses were analyzed in 79 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, a positive proliferative response (stimulation index &gt;2) was seen in 65 to 75% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had a much higher incidence of proliferative response to each growth factor (79 to 90%) and a much higher level of 3H-TdR incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship to treatment outcome was evaluated in 79 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients whose leukemic cells had a positive proliferative response to any growth factor, especially IL-3 and SCF, had a poorer outcome, ie a lower complete remission (CR) rate, shorter CR duration, and shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome was particularly poor in patients whose leukemic cells had proliferative responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four or any of the growth factors, compared to patients whose leukemic cells had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increased response may be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
