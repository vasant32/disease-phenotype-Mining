<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Department of Haematology, Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, from April 2004 to March, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Fifty patients of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to French-American-British (FAB) criteria and the epidemiological, clinical and haematological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used to describe data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 31 males and 19 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 41 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to FAB classification, 39 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 1 case of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblast, 6 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and 4 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest complaint was easy fatiguability affecting 41 cases (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> was the most common finding seen in 47 patients (94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> was seen in 33 cases (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dyserythropoeisis was present in 42 (84%); dysmyelopoeisis was seen in 21 (42%) and morphologically abnormal megakaryocytes were identified in 29 (58%) of the bone marrow aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Grade- III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162460" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">reticulosis</z:e> was seen in 9 bone marrow trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) were present in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was more frequent in young males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> constituted a major chunk of the disease entity </plain></SENT>
