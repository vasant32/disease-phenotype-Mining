<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the aim of diminishing this risk, attempts have been made to modify or prevent varicella by passive immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From September 1985 to March 1991, five children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, having a total of seven episodes of intimate exposure to varicella, received a single dose (200 mg/kg) of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 3 days of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients included four children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and one child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the five children developed varicella following IVIG infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IVIG appears to be an effective and safe alternative for preventing varicella in immunocompromised patients upon intimate exposure, when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zoster</z:e> immunoglobulin or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster</z:e> immunoglobulin is unavailable, as in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
