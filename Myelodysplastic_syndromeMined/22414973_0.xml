<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some reports suggest that Asian and Western <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have different cytogenetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 168 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and compared our results with other Chinese centers to investigate the prevalence and cytogenetic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study, chromosome abnormalities were detected in 40.48% of patients (68/168) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the median survival time did not differ between younger and older (â‰¥60 years) patients (p = 0.969), survival curves based on International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic groups and WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk groups were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival differences were observed between patients in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype group, sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 group, and poor cytogenetic group according to IPSS (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the results from 2 other large Chinese centers, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was the most detected cytogenetic abnormality, with a prevalence of 14.21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8, categorized as intermediate cytogenetic risk group in our study, is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
