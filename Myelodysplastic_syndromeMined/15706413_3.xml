<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined serum HGF in 59 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum HGF levels in NHL patients were increased, as were levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some 29 patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including 20 with adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, exhibited a significant increase in serum HGF, as did 23 with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum HGF correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>increased neutrophil counts</z:mp> (r=0.487, p&lt;0.0001), and also paralleled a neutrophil increase in NHL patients who received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at the nadir of neutrophil count following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in in vitro experiments, HGF secretion from polymorphonuclear neutrophils and its expression in bone marrow myeloid cells were stimulated by G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although HGF has been thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of NHL through its angiogenic activities, these results suggest that HGF production by neutrophils and myeloid lineage cells may also contribute to an increase in serum HGF in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
