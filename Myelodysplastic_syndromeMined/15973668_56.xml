<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> were seen for pretreatment evaluation of their cognitive function and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the sample was reevaluated 1 month later, when response to protocol chemotherapy was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant proportion of patients had impaired cognitive function prior to the institution of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of patients also experienced significant <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of the circulating cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1RA), IL-6, IL-8, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were elevated highly compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher IL-6 levels were associated with poorer executive function, whereas higher IL-8 levels were associated with better memory performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-6, IL-1RA, and TNF-alpha levels were related to ratings of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> were unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were not associated significantly with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who obtained a complete response tended to have better fine motor control at baseline and lower circulating IL-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment did not have a significant impact on cognition, although <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> levels tended to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> are highly symptomatic and experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> before the initiation of their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The current results indicated a correlation between these symptoms and levels of circulating cytokines, providing some support to the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related symptoms are related at least in part to cytokine-immunologic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of immunologic correlates of symptoms will allow for targeted interventions </plain></SENT>
