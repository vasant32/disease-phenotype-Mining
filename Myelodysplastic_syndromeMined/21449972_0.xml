<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old man was diagnosed with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 1998, and he was first given methenolone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> orally because of gradual progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this treatment was not effective, so we changed the treatment to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9464">testosterone enanthate</z:chebi> because of his symptoms with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three months after <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> replacement therapy (TRT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> had improved, and mean platelet count and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> had significant increases from 2.36 ± 0.45 × 10(4) to 3.83 ± 0.78 × 10(4) /µL, and from 11.7 ± 0.81 to 15.2 ± 1.00 g/dL, respectively, which contributed to a decrease in platelet transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then, the patient has been on a good clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9464">testosterone enanthate</z:chebi> administration could be an alternative treatment for men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, even in the case where treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50786">anabolic-androgenic steroids</z:chebi> is not successful, and suggests another interesting effect of TRT on platelets </plain></SENT>
