<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) provides a clinical model for risk stratification of patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, notable variability in prognosis is still observed within the same IPSS category </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined HIF-1α by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow specimens from 81 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the expression rate of HIF-1α was 49.4% (40/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including age, bone marrow blast percentage, cytogenetics, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, white blood cell count and IPSS score demonstrated that HIF-1α (p = 0.049, HR = 2.704) was an independent prognostic indicator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of HIF-1α was correlated with poor overall survival (p &lt; 0.001) and disease progression (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, correlation analysis revealed that the expression of HIF-1α was associated with bone marrow blast percentage (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.510), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> count (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.649) and cytogenetics (p = 0.009, r = 0.287) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> achieved a better therapeutic effect compared to traditional chemotherapy in HIF-1α positive patients </plain></SENT>
