<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several reports have been made on each of these agents separately, no study has yet been conducted to evaluate the effect of these two types of agents in the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a nationwide, large-scale population study, the clinical and cytogenetic features as well as the prognostic factors in 256 patients with TRL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 61 years, and the median period of latency from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 47.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latency period was significantly shorter in patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The morphological diagnosis of TRL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in 59% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 41% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities that frequently involved chromosomes 5, 7 or 11 were documented in 77% of the 189 patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MLL gene rearrangements were detected in 11 of 58 subjects and were correlated with a borderline significance (P = 0.072) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival was only 9.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was similar in cases with or without MLL gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified chromosome 5 abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003075'>hypoproteinemia</z:hpo>, poor therapy outcomes for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, C-reactive protein, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> as being significantly poor prognostic factors (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This large-population study provided a comprehensive update of TRL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> status in Japan, identified significant prognostic factors, and enabled the clinical significance of MLL gene rearrangement to be assessed </plain></SENT>
