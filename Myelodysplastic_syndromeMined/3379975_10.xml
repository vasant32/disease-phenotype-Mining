<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients first received a loading dose on four consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients showed improvement in cytopenias during the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three of the responders severely depressed blood cell counts recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far the maximum duration of a response after the cessation of the treatment is 25 months, and the two ongoing responses have lasted for 11 and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two responders of the eight patients with more than 15% ring sideroblasts the number of ring sideroblasts decreased during the treatment but remained unchanged in six non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The responders were characterized by a low or low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthase activity which increased during the treatment, whereas the non-responders showed a higher mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthase activity which decreased during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the responders had significantly fewer defects in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthetic enzyme activities than the non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FAB type, karyotype or growth pattern in in vitro cultures of hematopoietic progenitors did not predict the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from one case of mild venous irritation, no other adverse effects were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> arginate induces beneficial effects on cytopenia in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and has very few side-effects </plain></SENT>
