<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated five patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) for 42 days and subsequently, between 1 and 3 months later, with rhG-CSF for 142 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to evaluate the safety and ability of these factors to elicit a neutrophil response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rhGM-CSF was administered at a dose of 3 to 30 micrograms/kg/d (30 to 60 minutes, intravenously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a specific, dose-dependent increase in the absolute granulocyte counts was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in four patients this increase was due to an increase in eosinophils, and in only one patient it was due to an increase in the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received rhG-CSF at a dose of 3 to 15 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to rhGM-CSF treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients responded to rhG-CSF during the first 6 weeks of treatment with an increase in the ANC to above 1,000/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of ANC could be maintained during maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the increase in ANC was associated with an improvement of a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> caused by Peptostreptococcus and resistant to antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated rhGM-CSF and rhG-CSF treatment without severe side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the beneficial effect of rhG-CSF in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
