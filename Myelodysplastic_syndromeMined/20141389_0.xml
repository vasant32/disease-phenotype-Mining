<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients' substance use problems are a particularly understudied aspect of psychosocial variables in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The specific hypothesis tested was that lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038586" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="AODD">substance use disorders</z:e> increased the risk of adverse outcome, in the context of other psychosocial and clinical characteristics demonstrated in other studies to have an impact on treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Prospective cohort study of 106 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None satisfied criteria for current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> or dependence, but the lifetime rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038586" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="AODD">substance use disorders</z:e> in this sample were 28% for alcohol, 12% for cannabis, and 9% for cocaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants received treatment as directed by their physicians, and were followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the end of the study (median 1.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival analysis identified three predictors of outcome: lifetime cocaine use, associated with a six-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = .04), and two protective variables, baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = .002) and estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) (p = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the potential significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038586" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="AODD">substance use disorders</z:e>, and lifetime cocaine diagnoses in particular, on treatment outcome for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas neither lifetime alcohol nor cannabis use were associated with survival on either the univariate or multivariate models of survival, lifetime cocaine diagnoses were associated with significant six-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = .04) </plain></SENT>
