<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have a diagnostic and prognostic impact and are increasingly considered for therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytomorphology and cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow (bm) cells define the goldstandard to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and to document treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a novel method using peripheral blood (pb) for frequent cytogenetic monitoring: after immunomagnetic cell separation circulating CD34+ cells were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared FISH analyses of enriched and non-enriched pb and bm cells with conventional chromosome banding analyses of bm metaphases: analysing circulating CD34+ cells by FISH is a sensitive, reliable method to measure the abnormal cell clones in pb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method is practicable, non-invasive, representative for the clonal situation in the bm, and has a predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its feasibility was proven in a cohort of 27 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
