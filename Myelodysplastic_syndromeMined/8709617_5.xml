<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few EpoR genetic abnormalities have been reported so far </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several reports have suggested EpoR abnormalities in both types of stem cell disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seven healthy controls, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, five agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, four essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>) and eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DNA was digested with four restriction enzymes (BamHI, Bgl II, Sacl and HindIII), followed by Southern blot, using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> radiolabeled probe, containing 1.5 kb of the human EpoR cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 MPD patients and seven out of the eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients demonstrated a restriction pattern which was identical to the seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, as well as to the erythroid cell line K562, and also consistent with the expected restriction map, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four enzymes tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern with three enzymes but a different one with HindIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HindIII 12 kb large band was replaced by a faint 12 kb band and a new (about 9 kb) band appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EpoR restriction map and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern obtained with the other three enzymes suggest that this patient has a 3 kb upstream deletion in one allelic EpoR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same molecular pattern was detected in the patient's sister, who suffers from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with mild bone marrow (BM) dyserythropoiesis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis showed that the patient's BM <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> carried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EpoR message </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This familial pattern may represent polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the patient's very high serum Epo level, her resistance to treatment with recombinant Epo, and the abnormally low growth rate of in vitro erythroid cultures, suggesting poor response to Epo in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> in her sister, support the speculation that the different EpoR gene might serve as a genetic predisposing marker and potentially could be involved (probably via post-transcriptional mechanisms and by an interaction with other factors or cytokines) in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the EpoR is intact in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patient had a familial different genetic structure, which could represent polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, we can speculate also that it might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
