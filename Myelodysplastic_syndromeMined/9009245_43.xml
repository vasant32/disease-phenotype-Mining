<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that factors present in the microenvironment are inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells whether stromal or parenchymal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis further, bone marrow biopsies from 46 MDS patients and eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were examined for the presence of three cytokines, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and one cellular component, macrophages, by the use of monoclonal antibodies immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed the presence of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta in 41/46 and 40/46 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> respectively, while only 15 cases showed the presence of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further a significant direct relationship was found between the degree of TNF-alpha and the incidence of PCD (p= 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed high PCD also had an elevated TNF-alpha level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression of high amounts of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta and low amounts of the viability factor GM-CSF may be responsible for the high incidence of PCD leading to ineffective hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be directed at attempting to reverse the lesion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using anti-TNF-alpha drugs such as pentoxifylline </plain></SENT>
