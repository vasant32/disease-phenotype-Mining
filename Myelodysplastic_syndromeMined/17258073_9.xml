<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Unbalanced chromosomal aberrations are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and have prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency of cytogenetic changes may reflect an inherent <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> due to failure of DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that chromosomal defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may be more frequent than predicted by metaphase cytogenetics and new cryptic lesions may be revealed by precise analysis methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a novel high-resolution karyotyping technique, array-based comparative genomic hybridization, to investigate the frequency of cryptic chromosomal lesions in a cohort of 38 well-characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> patients; results were confirmed by microsatellite quantitative PCR or single nucleotide polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared to metaphase karyotyping, chromosomal abnormalities detected by array-based analysis were encountered more frequently and in a higher proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, chromosomal defects were found in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype by traditional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to verifying common abnormalities, previously cryptic defects were found in new regions of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cryptic changes often overlapped chromosomes and regions frequently identified as abnormal by metaphase cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results underscore the instability of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> genome and highlight the utility of array-based karyotyping to study cryptic chromosomal changes which may provide new diagnostic information </plain></SENT>
