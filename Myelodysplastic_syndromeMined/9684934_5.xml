<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the elderly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is characterized by a poorer prognosis than in younger patients, due to either host related factors (poor performance status, co-morbid diseases, organ function impairment) or the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> itself (high incidence of adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, high frequency of preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, intrinsic resistance to cytotoxic drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current therapeutic results are mostly unsatisfactory and studies reporting high rates of complete remission are probably influenced by selection biases as suggested by the low rate of elderly patients inclusion into cooperative trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Availability of intensive support including hematopoietic growth factors could stimulate clinicians to manage an increasing number of elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with aggressive programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, chemotherapy in the elderly is difficult, costly and usually associated with high morbidity and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efforts should be made to identify those subset of elderly patients in whom aggressive treatment may result in a true improvement of disease free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The critical analysis of our five years experience, as reported here, seems to suggest that older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients displaying unfavourable prognostic factors at diagnosis (i.e., adverse karyotype and high serum LDH levels), but clinically eligible for intensive chemotherapy, do not actually benefit from an aggressive approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A blind attempt to treat these patients aggressively may be associated with a life threatening toxicity not counterbalanced by an actual survival advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest therefore that aggressive treatment should be reserved for elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases in whom the presence of good prognostic factors at diagnosis predicts that the loss of some patients due to toxicity may be balanced by the achievement of a substantial proportion of long term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, given the biological and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, a more precise prognostic categorization of these patients would be particularly useful in interpreting future therapeutic results </plain></SENT>
