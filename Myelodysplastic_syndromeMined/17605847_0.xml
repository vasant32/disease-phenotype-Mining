<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the positive rate of CD133 in 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients was 51.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (16/29, 55.2%) was significantly higher than that in control group (2/15, 13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in CD133 expression between <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of CD133 in 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 55.56% (5/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells with CD34(+) was higher than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells with CD34(-), and there was significant difference in expression of CD133 between them (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 had no relationship with the clinical prognostic factors such as sex, age, the percentage of leukemic cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow, WBC counts, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, platelet counts and LDH level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of CD133 in bone marrow cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is higher than that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 is significantly correlated with the expression of CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high expression of CD133 may be an adverse prognostic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
