<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed an open, nonrandomized, multicenter phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of 1 year of treatment with the oral iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> deferiprone in 38 mainly nonthalassemic patients with transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial serum ferritin varied between 996 and 11.644 micrograms/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with 3-6 g of deferiprone daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean urinary iron excretion (UIE) in 36 evaluable patients was 21.0 mg/24 h and was significantly higher in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative iron balance was achieved in 20 patients (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of treatment was 10 months; due to side effects and other causes only 20 patients completed 1 year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean serum ferritin levels decreased from 3563 micrograms/l at the start of the trial to 2767 micrograms/l at 6 months (26 patients, p &lt; 0.004) and to 2186 micrograms/l at 12 months (20 patients, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels normalized in two patients who were no longer transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deferiprone was clearly not effective in three patients (two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> developed <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> after 12 months of treatment; this was rapidly reversible after stopping deferiprone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a mild and transient decrease in white blood cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other side effects leading to withdrawal from the trial consisted mainly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (3 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> (2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">zinc deficiency</z:e> were seen, although zinc excretion was increased in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No changes were seen in liver enzymes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, antinuclear factor, T-cell subsets, cardiac function, visual acuity, and audiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although our results confirm deferiprone as an effective iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> and in some patients with other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, there is still some concern about the safety of this drug, which therefore, at this time, should be used exclusively in well-controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
