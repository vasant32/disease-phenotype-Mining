<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) the colony growth of PBSC was definitely reduced as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in RA with unfavorable chromosomal aberrations, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and in advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t), the number of myeloid progenitor cells increased up to 100-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), the increase was even more marked, up to 350-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the number of PBSC was strongly elevated, these cells were not able to restore hematopoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the increase of circulating colony-forming cells (CFC) seems to be associated with disease progression, and thus, the evaluation of PBSC could be an important parameter in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
