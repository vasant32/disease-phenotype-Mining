<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C) and aggressive chemotherapy was assessed in 67 patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, treatment was started because of worsening peripheral cytopenia, increase in bone marrow blasts, or transition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 51 patients (age range, 18-82 years) receiving low-dose Ara-C by subcutaneous bolus injection (10 mg/m2 every 12 hours) or continuous intravenous infusion (20 mg/m2/day), nine (18%) entered complete remission (CR) and four (8%) had a partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duration of CR varied from 4 to 25+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival of patients treated with Ara-C was not superior to that of a historical control receiving supportive care only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity of low-dose Ara-C was considerable, with 12 patients (24%) dying of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during the initial treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (age range, 17-65 years) who presented with a Karnofsky score of more than 80% were chosen for aggressive chemotherapy using standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, nine CR and two PR were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> occurred in two patients, and three patients had refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The factors most strongly associated with successful remission induction were (1) presence of Auer rods in granulocyte precursors, and (2) a comparatively low medullary blast count (less than 30%) at the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median duration of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> for patients entering CR was 21 days (range, 6-51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged remissions (22+, 27+, and 29 months, respectively) could be achieved in three of four patients receiving consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy after induction of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that aggressive chemotherapy should not generally be considered contraindicated in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with a good Karnofsky score, this form of treatment may be more advantageous than the currently favored low-dose Ara-C, which is also myelotoxic, but induces remissions in only a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
