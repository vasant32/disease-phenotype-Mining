<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed clinical and hematologic features of nine patients with acquired idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (AISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of them had ringed sideroblasts (RS) more than 15% of marrow nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RS persisted in the marrow even in the remaining two patients who had a relatively low marrow erythroblasts despite RS ranging from 1/4 to half of the marrow erythroid series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, RS declined in proportion in another two patients of the nine whose disease progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), although a high proportion of RS reappeared in one patient at the time of relapse following allogeneic marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar decline of RS concomitant with disease progression was also seen in seven additional patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) with sideroblastic erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities, although rare initially, became detectable either at the time of disease progression or at the worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in AISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the majority of AISA fall in the category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and that a progressive decline in RS is part of the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Closer follow-up of the proportion of RS in patients with AISA is warranted to better understand its biologic significance </plain></SENT>
