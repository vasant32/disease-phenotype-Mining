<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following cellular uptake, DAC is activated to DAC-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (TP) and incorporated into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once incorporated into the DNA, DAC-TP binds and inactivates DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), thereby leading to hypomethylation and re-expression of epigenetically silenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes and ultimately antileukemia activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, direct evidence of in vivo DAC-TP occurrence in DAC-treated patients has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of suitable validated analytical methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we developed and validated a nonradioactive sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS assay for quantification of DAC-TP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay is linear from 50 to 1,000 nM and from 1 to 10 Î¼M and has a lower limit of quantitation of 50 nM and a coefficient of variation for both within- and between-day precision &lt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following DAC treatment, we detected DAC-TP in parental and DAC-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells (in vitro) and bone marrow (BM) and spleen of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic mice (in vivo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of DNMTs and correlation of DAC-TP concentration with proteins involved in mechanisms of DAC resistance were also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical applicability of this method was proven by measuring DAC-TP level in BM and blood mononuclear cells from DAC-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher levels are seemingly associated with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monitoring the DAC-TP intracellular level may serve as a novel pharmacological endpoint for designing more effective DAC-based regimens </plain></SENT>
