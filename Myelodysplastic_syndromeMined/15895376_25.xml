<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty older patients with recurrent or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated in a Phase II protocol with sequential VPA and ATRA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VPA was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day and then escalated to achieve the serum concentration of 45-100 microg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATRA was added at 45 mg/square meters (sm) per day when VPA reached the target serum concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients treated continuously for &gt; or = 2 months were considered evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematologic improvement, according to World Health Organization criteria, was observed in 6 of 20 patients enrolled in the protocol but in 6 of 11 considered evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients, a major platelet response was observed, achieving platelet transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these five patients also exhibited a minor erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sixth patient showed both a minor erythroid response and a platelet response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 189 days (range, 63-550 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant reduction in the blast count was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 neurocortical toxicity was observed in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> was experienced by 4 patients (2 Grade 4 and 2 Grade 3) and was associated with an increase in the peripheral blast cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ATRA did not modify the response observed with VPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation therapy with VPA was of clinical benefit in approximately 30% of elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast type with unfavorable prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A striking platelet transfusion independence lasting several months may be obtained in some patients, reducing the burden of palliative care and improving the quality of life </plain></SENT>
