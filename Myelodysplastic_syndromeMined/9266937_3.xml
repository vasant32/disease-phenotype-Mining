<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These disorders have some features in common, and a percentage of cases progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculated that changes in gene stability are involved in the pathogenesis of these haemopoietic stem cell disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we investigated in vivo mutation frequencies in these disorders by erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) mutation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay enumerates NO or NN variant cells in 106 erythrocytes of the MN type using a flowcytometric technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing chemotherapy known to be at risk of hypermutageneity were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Events exceeding the 95th percentile of healthy donors (&gt; or = 32 and 34 events, respectively for NO and NN variants) were defined as abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal events in the NO variants were found in three out of seven patients undergoing chemotherapy, two out of nine patients with AA, two out of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and four out of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal events in the NN variants were found in three out of seven patients undergoing chemotherapy, two out of nine patients with AA, one out of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and two out of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that not only PIG-A, but also other genes including the GPA gene, are hypermutable in haemopoietic stem cell disorders, and that mutagenic pressure and/or gene instability can contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
