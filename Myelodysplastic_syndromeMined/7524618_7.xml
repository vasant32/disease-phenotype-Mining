<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ANLL) derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in whom the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) first emerged at the late stage of ANLL transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, the Ph1 chromosome was not detected until the late stage of ANLL transformation, 14 months after the transformation following a 3-month history of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells with and without the Ph1 chromosome had a common abnormal chromosome, t(3;3) (q21;q26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed no bcr/abl message at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding P210bcr/abl was detected in the early stage of ANLL transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoding both P210bcr/abl and P190bcr/abl were detected in the late stage of ANLL transformation when the Ph1 chromosome was detected by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These evidences support a multistep pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, and the products of bcr/abl fusion gene may influence the course of disease </plain></SENT>
