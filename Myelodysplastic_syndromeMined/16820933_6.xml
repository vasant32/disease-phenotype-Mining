<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the involvement of the PI-PLCbeta1 gene in erythroid differentiation lead us to investigate this gene in patients affected by high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we have previously evidenced that, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GTG banding and a fatal outcome, the PI-PLCbeta1 gene undergoes monoallelic and interstitial deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR is characterized by high sensitivity, excellent precision and large dynamic range, and has become the method of choice for quantitative gene expression measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have performed a relative quantification real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients tested for FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have evaluated the expression of the PI-PLCbeta1 gene on healthy donors and the HL60 cell line, which is useful for testing the accuracy of the technology because of its low expression of PI-PLCbeta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To analyze and quantify the levels of the two different splicing variants of PI-PLCbeta1 gene (1a and 1b), we have used a TaqMan isoform specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have seen that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have higher levels of the PI-PLCbeta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared to the HL60 cell line as expected, but lower levels compared to the healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts always express higher levels of PI-PLCbeta1b <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared to PI-PLCbeta1a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support the contention that the deletion of the PI-PLCbeta1 gene is indeed responsible for a reduced expression of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the splicing isoform 1b, which is only nuclear, seems to be somehow partially preserved compared to the 1a isoform, which is nuclear and cytoplasmatic, hinting at a possible imbalance of the nuclear versus cytoplasmatic PI-PLC signaling which, in turn, could affect the cell cycle progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts </plain></SENT>
