<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> on cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cell line MUTZ-1 and possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MUTZ-1 cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, cell proliferation capability was determined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, protein expression including Annexin V/PI, caspase 3, PTEN, p-Akt, p-mTOR and the cell cycle were analyzed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in concentration-and time-dependent manners (r=0.67, 0.61, 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> for 24-72 hours, cell count in G0/G1 were significantly higher than that of the control (p&lt;0.01), and this effect showed a time-and concentration-dependency (r=0.94, 0.93, 0.92), the cell cycle was blocked in G0/G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared with control group, the proportion of Annexin V+PI-MUTZ-1 cells and the cellular PTEN levels increased in the treated group dramatically and in time-and dose-dependent manners (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To the contrary, level of p-mTOR expression markedly decreased as compared with control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> inhibits the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells, down-regulates the PTEN/PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by interaction with mTOR, which induces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of mUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
