<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These coculture studies used fresh or cryopreserved marrow T lymphocytes with fresh or cryopreserved marrow T cell-depleted target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of five aplastic patients had little or no transfusion exposure before studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composite results showed that, in comparison to the erythropoietic effects of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HLA-identical marrow T lymphocytes or engrafted T lymphocytes, T lymphocytes collected from the aplastic patients before BMT consistently suppressed or failed to support CFUE and BFUE growth optimally from autologous marrow, HLA-identical marrow, or engrafted aplastic T cell-depleted marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This T cell abnormality was not observed in four multiply transfused leukemics and three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marker analyses of SAA marrow T lymphocytes performed before and after BMT suggested that the erythropoietic functional abnormality was due to abnormal marrow T cell composition reflecting an excess of activated Tac+, T3+, T11+ lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these in vitro studies provide firmer in vitro evidence implicating T cells in the pathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The erythropoietic <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cells abnormalities</z:mp> in SAA are fully corrected by allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
