<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokine treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> may further reduce the platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied serum thrombopoietin levels (S-TPO) in 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 96 healthy controls and related the results to clinical and morphological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-TPO was also assessed after treatment with granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in 30 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S-TPO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was not a normally distributed variable; mean value was 394 pg/ml, SD +/-831 and median value 123 (12-5000 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The controls showed lower S-TPO levels than the patients (median 78 pg/ml, P = 0.003) whereas no differences between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups were observed (P = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ringed sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) showed the highest platelet counts and higher S-TPO levels than the controls (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between platelet counts and S-TPO levels was found in the patients (P = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TPO levels were generally low in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), but very high levels were found in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high transfusion need had higher S-TPO levels, whereas bone marrow blast counts, cellularity or megakaryocytes showed no correlation with S-TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with 5q- showed lower TPO levels than the other patients, indicating that thrombopoietin is not a mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with G-CSF + EPO significantly reduced the platelet counts (P = 0.0002), but this change was not related to significant changes in S-TPO levels or <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> who normalized their platelet counts showed a concomitant reduction in S-TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>increased platelet counts</z:hpo> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> may be caused by increased S-TPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study shows that platelet, megakaryocyte and thrombopoietin regulation is rather complex in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and that spontaneous or induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are not usually mirrored by increased S-TPO levels </plain></SENT>
