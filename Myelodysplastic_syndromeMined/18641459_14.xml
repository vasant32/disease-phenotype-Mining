<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors (such as azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39146">trichostatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi>) efficiently induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the P39 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell line, correlating with an inhibition of NFkappaB (which translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was obtained rapidly, within a few hours, suggesting that it was not due to epigenetic reprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, DNMT and HDAC inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of the NFkappaB-activating kinase IKKalpha/beta, and this effect was also observed in enucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, circulating myeloblasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients treated with the DNMT inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> manifested a rapid (2 hours post-treatment) inhibition of NFkappaB and IKKalpha/beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results indicate that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors can inhibit the constitutive activation of NFkappaB in malignant myeloblasts in vitro and in vivo through a novel mechanism </plain></SENT>
