<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis has been <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in the great majority of these patients; only four have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High resolution analysis at the 550 band stage localized the breakpoints in chromosomes #6 and #9 to p23 and 9q34.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations employing high resolution cytogenetics have mapped the typical 9q breakage site in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> to 9q34.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated that the cellular oncogene c-abl remains on the derivative 9q+ chromosome in t(6;9), whereas it is moved to the Ph marker in t(9;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combined data indicate that c-abl is located between 9q34.1 and 9q34.3, i.e., in subband 9q34.2 or its immediate vicinity </plain></SENT>
