<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received a 5-day course of cladribine (9 mg/m(2) per dose) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> either as daily 2-h infusions (500 mg/m(2) per dose) (arm A) or a continuous infusion (500 mg/m(2) per day) (arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> levels and inhibition of DNA synthesis increased from day 1 to day 2, but were not different between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the median blast percentages at day 15 did not differ between arms A and B, but patients treated in arm A had shorter intervals between the initiation of the first and second courses of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, although there were trends toward better complete remission rates and overall survival for patients treated in arm B, the reduced efficacy of arm A may have been partially compensated by more intense timing of therapy for that group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 5-year event-free survival and overall survival estimates were 44.1+/-5.4 and 50.0+/-5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that cladribine in combination with continuous-infusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is effective therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
