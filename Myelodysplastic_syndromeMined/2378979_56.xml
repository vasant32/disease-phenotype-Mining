<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses of rhIL-3 ranged from 250 micrograms/m2 to 500 micrograms/m2 and were given as daily subcutaneous bolus injections for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood leucocyte counts increased 1.3- to 3.6-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients, including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, basophils, and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean absolute neutrophil counts increased from 1,350/microL (range, 150 to 2,420) to 2,660/microL (range, 300 to 9,380) (P less than .05) immediately after the end of rhIL-3 therapy and to a maximum count of 4,096/microL (range, 350 to 10,820) (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet responses were seen in two of four profoundly thrombocytopenic patients, resulting in discontinuation of platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The requirements for red blood cell transfusion temporarily improved in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of plasma cells was evident by a significant increase in serum IgM and IgA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild side effects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, local <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>) were observed in some patients, while transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> developed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease progression with an increase in blast cells was seen in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rhIL-3 is effective in stimulating hematopoiesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lineages in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and may produce at least short-term hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
