<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well documented that the calcitonin gene area in the short arm of chromosome 11 is hypermethylated in most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the gene is normally methylated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> but turns hypermethylated as the disease escalates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the methylation of the calcitonin gene correlates with the disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, it seemed worthwhile to study the gene methylation in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">premalignant hematologic conditions</z:e> with a potential to terminate in fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here on the calcitonin gene methylation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) using a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and standard Southern blotting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirates from a total of 26 MDS patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 24 of these patients, the calcitonin gene was hypermethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the methylation status and the morphological stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients with a blast count &lt; 5% had a hypermethylated gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients with a blast count &gt; 5%, 17 were hypermethylated only two having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation status of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that the hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene area in the short arm of chromosome 11 may be an early event in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The methylation analysis may thus be of value as a diagnostic tool in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but an abnormal methylation pattern does not seem to have a direct relation with the degree of blast infiltration </plain></SENT>
