<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The red blood cell precursors in 9 patients showed varying degrees of dyserythropoiesis including the presence of 2 or more nuclei, nuclei with bizarre shape and iron deposits in the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The myeloid series showed a tendency to hypogranulation (5 patients) and in 2 patients there were signs of platelet phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monocytes had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrastructure except for one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) with transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelo-monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, the monocytes were immature, with markedly convoluted nuclei and scanty heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lymphocytes also had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance, except for one patient in whom the lymphocytes were immature, with lobulated nuclei and suggested transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma cells in 3 patients were slightly increased in number and in one of them Russell bodies were seen both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The megakaryocytic series showed a shift to the left and in one patient there were signs of emperipolesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The alterations in the hematopoietic cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> described in the present study indicate that the electron microscope may supplement light microscopic findings and help in the establishment of a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be also evident in those cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in which the very early stages of leukemic transformation cannot be easily detected by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
