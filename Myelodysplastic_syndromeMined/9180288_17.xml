<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By application of morphological and ultrastructural methods for identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we analyzed the incidence of morphologically evident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the bone marrow of 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and in the bone marrow of 12 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to FAB classification, out of 30 patients, eight (26.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, three (10%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, 14 (46.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and two (6.8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients (10%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were examined on semithin slides and expressed as the apoptotic index (AI) (percent counted on at least 1000 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An overall increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was found (median AI in patients vs controls, 3.13% vs 1.05%, P &lt; 0.01 by Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, negative correlation between AI and white blood cell count was found (linear r= -0.53, or Spearman rank R= -0.52, both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with evident karyotype changes AI was not higher than in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that discrete alterations in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are present even in karyotypically '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly support the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has a role in ineffective hematopoiesis and may be a mechanism responsible for the paradox of hypercellular bone marrow and peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
