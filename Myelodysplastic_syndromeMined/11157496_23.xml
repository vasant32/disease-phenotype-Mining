<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report clinical features and analysis of functions of cells from a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and infectious complications similar to those in the severe form of LAD-1, but whose circulating neutrophils displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of beta2 integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of these cells to immobilized ligands and to endothelial cells and assays of cell-cell aggregation and chemotaxis demonstrated a profound defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> mediated by beta2 integrins indicative of a variant form of LAD-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel cell line established from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from the subject demonstrated deficient beta2 integrin-dependent adhesive function similar to that of the primary leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, these cells had markedly impaired beta1 integrin-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis and electrophoretic mobility of beta1 and beta2 proteins from the cell line demonstrated that the defects were not a result of structural abnormalities in the integrin subunit chains themselves and suggest that the adhesive phenotype of these cells is due to one or more abnormalities of inside-out signaling mechanisms that regulate the activity of integrins of these classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These features define a unique LAD-1 variant syndrome that may reveal important insights that are generally relevant to inside-out signaling of integrins, a molecular process that is as yet incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
