<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were highly significant correlations between the bone marrow and serum concentrations of the respective <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially, the concentrations of 25-OH-D and 1,25(OH)2D in the bone marrow gave very similar values to those in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a big advantage in controlling the bone marrow levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolites in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, because doctors can calculate the bone marrow levels from the serum levels of the respective <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolites without bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha-OH-D3) was administered orally to eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, clinical conditions were improved in seven patients: four complete remissions (CR), one partial response (PR), and two minor responses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the therapy with 1 alpha-OH-D3 is fairly effective for curing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> although it is not dramatic </plain></SENT>
