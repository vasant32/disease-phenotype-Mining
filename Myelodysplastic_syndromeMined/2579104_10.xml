<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nine of 19 patients the granulocytes showed a decrease in myeloid or an increase in monocyte antigen expression or both </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> the granulocyte-macrophage progenitors do not develop along two divergent lines but differentiate with the emergence of dual characteristics </plain></SENT>
