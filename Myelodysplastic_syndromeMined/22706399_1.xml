<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is aberrantly activated, suggesting that the increased pathway activity may be correlated with the development and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOX7 protein, encoded by the sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) gene, inhibits the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the DNA methylation can regulate the transcription of SOX7 gene, we used the methylation-specific PCR to investigate the methylation status of the CpG island in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to determine the potential correlation of the SOX7 methylation with the development and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the CpG island of the SOX7 gene was methylated in 58.1% (97/167) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but not in any healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the percentage of patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene was significantly higher in patients at advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in the patients at early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased percentages of this SOX7 methylation were also correlated with age, marrow blast levels, and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After prognostic analysis, we found that patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene had shorter overall survival and cumulative survival than patients with unmethylated CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the methylation of the CpG island of the SOX7 gene can be used as a predictive factor for the development and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
