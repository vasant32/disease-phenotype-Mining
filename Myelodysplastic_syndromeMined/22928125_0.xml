<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been a long history of reports describing a variety of paraneoplastic phenomena associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, particularly those with autoimmune manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a series of patients with an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (MPN) that underwent aggressive transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case, the transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was preceded by an inflammatory syndrome characterized by unilateral extremity swelling and an associated inflammatory skin infiltrate, as well as other signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, including profound hyperferritinemia without evidence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that such an inflammatory syndrome may herald aggressive transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN who present with these features may benefit from early bone marrow examination to assess disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in select patients may result in improvement or resolution of the symptoms and permit intensive therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> to be delivered </plain></SENT>
