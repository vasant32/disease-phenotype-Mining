<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous erythropoietin (r-huEPO) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) requiring periodical blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed on 9 MDS patients distributed as follows: 4 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 2 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> and 1 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had been diagnosed at least three months earlier and had a mean monthly transfusion requirement of 3.5 blood units (range, 2-5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum EPO levels were assessed by ELISA, subcutaneous r-huEPO was given at a doses of 10,000 IU three times a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive response was defined as increase of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> rates in 1 g/dL or decrease of transfusion requirements in 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A negative response was registered when the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> rates or transfusion requirements were maintained in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were evaluated 4,6 and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response to treatment was seen in five patients (56%), who showed increased <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> rates and in four of them (45%) no transfusions were needed since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive response to r-huEPO appeared within the 4th week of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The four unresponsive patients (44%) showed no changes in spite of prolonged treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive responses correlated with increased red-cell progenitors in the bone marrow and decreased myelo/erythroid ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No severe untoward effects were seen with this treatment, and mild local pain at the sites of injection was alleviated by warming the r-huEPO solution before administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> can be initially treated with r-huEPO for 4 weeks, although it seems advisable to maintain this treatment in respondents until the maximal response has been attained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, when no response is seen in that period treatment must be discontinued </plain></SENT>
