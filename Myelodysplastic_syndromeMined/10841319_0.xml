<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have modified this method for practical use in bone marrow specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The modified VPM stain labels megakaryocytes very well, while other marrow cells are poorly colorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This staining procedure was more stable, and its color intensity was finer and clearer than the original </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this stain, morphologic classification of megakaryocytes in bone marrow specimens from 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many megakaryocytes observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were juvenile compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects according to their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blasts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (M7) and from a megakaryoblastic cell line (Mo7e) were also clearly stained with our method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This staining method is practical and very useful for rapid identification of megakaryocyte distribution and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
