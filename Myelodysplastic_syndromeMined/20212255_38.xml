<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally not offered because of concerns of excess morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow increased use of allogeneic HCT for older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define prognostic factors impacting long-term outcomes of RIC regimens in patients older than age 40 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first complete remission or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to determine the impact of age, we analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed data reported to the CIBMTR (1995 to 2005) on 1,080 patients undergoing RIC HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes analyzed included neutrophil recovery, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Univariate analyses demonstrated no age group differences in NRM, grade 2 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients age 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and &gt; or = 65 years had 2-year survival rates as follows: 44% (95% CI, 37% to 52%), 50% (95% CI, 41% to 59%), 34% (95% CI, 25% to 43%), and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 49%), respectively, for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = .06); and 42% (95% CI, 35% to 49%), 35% (95% CI, 27% to 43%), 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 25% to 51%), respectively, for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = .37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed no significant impact of age on NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; .3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater HLA disparity adversely affected 2-year NRM, DFS, and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable cytogenetics adversely impacted relapse, DFS, and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Better pre-HCT performance status predicted improved 2-year OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION With these similar outcomes observed in older patients, we conclude that older age alone should not be considered a contraindication to HCT </plain></SENT>
