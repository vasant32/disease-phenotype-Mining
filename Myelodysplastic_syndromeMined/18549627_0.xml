<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies recognizing myeloid precursors (CD15), erythroid precursors (GPA), T cells (CD3(+)CD56(-)CD16(-)), B cells (CD19), NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+)CD16(+)) were used to sort bone marrow cells in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient with del (20q) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and PI were used to sort bone marrow Annexin V(+)PI(-) and Annexin V(-)PI(-) cells by FACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sorted positive cells were detected by interphase dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) using a LSI D20S108 probe (Spectrum Orange) and a Telvysion TM 20p probe (Spectrum Green) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FACS and FISH analysis were also performed on the samples from 4 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the proportions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone in the myeloid and erythroid precursors were 70.50% and 93.33% respectively, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> patient with del (20q) and were obviously higher than that in control group (5.39% and 6.17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of abnormal clone in T, B and NK cells were 3.23%, 4.32% and 5.77% respectively and were less than that in control group (5.76%, 4.85%, 6.36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of apoptotic cells in the bone marrow nucleated cells was 16.09% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone in Annexin V(+)PI(-) and Annexin V(-)PI(-) cells were 32.48% and 70.11%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that most myeloid and erythroid precursors are originated from the abnormal clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del (20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A little part of apoptotic cells are derived from the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
