<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only limited information on long-term outcome is currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a long-term follow-up analysis of 42 patients with low or intermediate risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 5q deletion treated with lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 40 months, 58% of the patients achieved an erythroid response and 48% a cytogenetic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent of patients progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of them (87%) acquired chromosome aberrations in addition to the 5q deletion, i.e. underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> during leukaemogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical, cytological or cytogenetic markers at study entry that allowed prediction of increased risk of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, erythroid and cytogenetic responders had a significantly decreased risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively) compared to non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three and 5 years after study entry, the cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> for patients with a cytogenetic response was 10% and 21%, respectively, and for patients without cytogenetic response, it was 46% and 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> without erythroid or cytogenetic remission after treatment with lenalidomide have a high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In refractory, or relapsing, patients, genetic instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> seem to be the driving forces of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regular follow-up investigations of del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients treated with lenalidomide may help to identify patients requiring alternative treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
