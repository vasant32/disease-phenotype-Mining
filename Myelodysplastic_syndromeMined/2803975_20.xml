<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of erythropoietin (Epo) has been measured by radioimmunoassay in 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an overall inverse relationship between the level of Epo and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> but a wide range of Epo response between patients with similar <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the different FAB groups, but the highest Epo levels were found in those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the intensity of erythroid activity in the marrow, as well as the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, may be a factor determining serum Epo concentration </plain></SENT>
