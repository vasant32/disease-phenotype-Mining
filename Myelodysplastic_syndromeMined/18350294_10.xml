<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize the deletion size among 38 MDS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) probes and to define commonly deleted and retained regions on chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were distributed in three groups according to the World Health Organization classification: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (22 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> (12 patients) and myelodysplastic/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH with centromeric, subtelomeric, and unique sequence probes was performed to characterize the deletion whereas its size was delineated using BAC clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 38 deletions were found to be interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A commonly deleted region was identified for each of the three groups; it varied from 6.62 to 10.4 Mb and showed considerable overlapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two commonly retained regions (CRR), also showing overlapping, were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, one in the centromeric region, the other in the telomeric region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deletion size is highly variable, with no apparent recurrent breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deletion may result in the loss of one or several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes but the target genes remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of genes plays an important part in the myeloid leukemic process associated with del(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, genes located in the retained chromosomal regions may also play a role in the oncogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
