<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A certain number of variables of prognostic value have then been isolated: excess of marrow blasts (more than 5%); presence of circulating blasts or karyotypic anomalies; reduction in the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (less than 1.043 10(9)/l, of monocytes (less than 0.136 10(9)/l), of platelets (less than 140 10(9)/l), of in vitro granulopoietic progenitors (less than 5 per 10(5) nucleated cells plated), of erythrocytic incorporation of 59Fe at day 14 (less than 12%), of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (less than 92 g/l); previous exposure to radiation or chemotherapy; early <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labeled erythrocytes study; marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in histology; less than 20% of ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
