<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a consensus International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for predicting outcome and planning therapy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the intermediate-risk cytogenetic subgroup defined by the IPSS includes a miscellaneous number of different single abnormalities for which real prognosis at present is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main aims of this study were to evaluate in an independent series the prognostic value of the IPSS and to identify chromosomal abnormalities with a previously unrecognized good or poor prognosis in 640 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, cases with single 1q abnormalities experienced poor survival, whereas those with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 had a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukaemic transformation than the remaining patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.009 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with single del(12p) had a similar survival to patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and showed some trend for a better survival than other cases belonging to the IPSS intermediate-risk cytogenetic subgroup (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses demonstrated that IPSS cytogenetic prognostic subgroup, proportion of bone marrow blasts and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level were the main prognostic factors for survival, and the first two characteristics and platelet count were the best predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukaemic transformation risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large international co-operative study should be carried out to clarify these findings </plain></SENT>
