<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lower thoracic and lumbar spine were evaluated on sagittal plane using a 1.5 Tesla superconducting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit with a surface coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse sequence of STIRs (TR 2000 msec, TI 160 msec, TE 20 msec) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four distinct patterns of signal intensity (SI) on the STIR images were classified as follows: pattern 1, homogeneously low SI; 2, marginally high SI; 3, heterogeneously high SI; 4, homogeneously high SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients with AA, STIR images initially revealed pattern 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 25 of 35 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the STIR images were initially classified as pattern 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The STIR images of 6 AA and 5 MDS patients with a clinical response to treatment showed pattern 2 similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The STIR images of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed an abnormal distribution of SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant signal changes in the STIR images can be observed in successive examinations of the patients, thus facilitating follow-up of the disease and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI of the bone marrow provides a noninvasive means of grossly examining a large fraction and is a useful technique in patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
