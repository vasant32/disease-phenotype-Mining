<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scatterplot analysis was used to identify mature and immature myeloid and erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of cells in the immature myeloid gate was determined by labeling cells with four monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were compared to results of cytologic and cytochemical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of a dog with a diagnosis of myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was a cluster of differentiation-18 (CD-18) positive, CD-14 negative, Thy-1 negative, and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of a dog with a diagnosis of myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was CD-18 positive, CD-14 positive, Thy-1 positive, and MHC class II positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although this phenotype clearly differentiated myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, it was similar to the immunophenotype of dogs with a diagnosis of malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of two dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was CD-18 positive and CD-14 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results for Thy-1 and MHC class II were variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As additional lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies become available, immunophenotyping should become a valuable tool for determination of the lineage of cells in canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
