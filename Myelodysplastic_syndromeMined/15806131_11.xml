<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of disease burden on the outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from several retrospective series suggest that overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at the time of transplant increases the risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the outcomes of 68 consecutive adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=60) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n=8) who received an allogeneic SCT at the University of Chicago between May 1986 and October 2002 to confirm the importance of currently recognized risk factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we wanted to determine whether quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> by blast percentage or cytogenetic abnormalities at the time of SCT was correlated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtypes based on the FAB classification were as follows: M0=9, M1=9, M2=16, M3=2, M4=16, M5=3, M6=5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was available from 52 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using standard morphologic criteria, 34 patients were in complete remission (CR) and 34 had visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of donors were HLA-identical siblings (n=55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 56 patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens and 12 received a reduced-intensity, fludarabine-based conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OS and PFS times were 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.8-10.4) and 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.2-7.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up from SCT was 4.6 years (range, 0.6-17.0) for survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the following factors were found to be associated with worse survival: (1) increased percentage of blasts in the bone marrow at the time of SCT, (2) presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, (3) mismatched donor, (4) Zubrod performance score of &gt;/=2, and (5) age &gt;/=45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also found a trend towards improved outcome among patients in cytogenetic remission as compared to those who had residual cytogenetic abnormalities and those in overt relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data support an association between pre-transplant disease burden and poor outcome after SCT </plain></SENT>
