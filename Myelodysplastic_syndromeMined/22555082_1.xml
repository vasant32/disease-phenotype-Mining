<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> (also known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">febrile neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e>) in two patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> therapy is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> use is rare (three published case reports since the drug's U.S. marketing approval in 2004), and the syndrome is not listed as a potential adverse reaction in the product packaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one of two cases of probable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> reported here, a 64-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) developed a severe erythematous and nodular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> with peeling on his arms, legs, and face after receiving the drug (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily) for three days; the second case involved a 67-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) who experienced a similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, as well as chills and an elevated body temperature, after five days of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the results of dermatologic or pathologic examination and skin biopsies were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the strongest evidence of a drug-induced etiology in these cases was the close temporal relationship between the initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> use and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e>, with prompt symptom resolution after the discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> use and administration of appropriate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was the apparent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and another with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both responded well to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After resolution of the reaction, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> was given to the first patient and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> to the second, without complications </plain></SENT>
