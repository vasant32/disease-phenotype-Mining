<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight months later, his condition had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after spontaneous resolution, and it then evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (AMKL) at the age of 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing analysis showed that the predominant TMD and AMKL clones had different GATA1 mutations, although a minor TMD clone identical to the AMKL clone was present at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that a minor clone rather than the predominant clone at the time of TMD may give rise to AMKL later on </plain></SENT>
