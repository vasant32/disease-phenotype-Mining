<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with R115777 at doses of 600 mg orally (PO) bid in cycles of 4 weeks of therapy followed by a 2-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose reduction rules for toxicity were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 28 patients treated were assessable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients responded (complete remission, n = 2; partial remission, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders included two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the responders had a diploid karyotype and one had multiple cytogenetic abnormalities including <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The starting dose of 600 mg PO bid resulted in side effects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, neurotoxicity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, or leg pain) necessitating dose reduction (n = 4) or discontinuation of therapy (n = 7) in 11 (41%) of 27 patients during the induction period (12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower doses of 300 mg PO bid were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses occurred in patients who had been reduced to this dose level during the initial two cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that R115777 has modest activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but that, in this patient population, 4 weeks of daily doses of 600 mg PO bid is not tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further exploration of the optimal dose/schedule and correlation with biologic end points are warranted </plain></SENT>
