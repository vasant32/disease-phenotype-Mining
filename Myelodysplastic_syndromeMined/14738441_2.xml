<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old male presented with peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004445'>elliptocytosis</z:hpo>, dyshaematopoietic features were not evident in his peripheral blood or hypercellular bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 18 months, he had progressed to RA with excess blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of red blood cell membrane proteins by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) showed a reduced quantity of protein 4.1 (30% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion of chromosome 20q was identified by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004445'>elliptocytosis</z:hpo>, persistent for more than 17 months, decreased strikingly after chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0004445'>elliptocytosis</z:hpo> occurred as an unusual morphological feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, associated with abnormalities of protein 4.1 and chromosome 20q </plain></SENT>
