<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the histomorphometric features of megakaryocytic elements in bone marrow trephine biopsies of various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Comparative image morphometry using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained and CD 61-stained trephine biopsies was carried out on 40 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects to analyze the megakaryocytes objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The various variables analyzed were number of megakaryocytes and micromegakaryocytes, area, perimeter and diameter of the megakaryocytic elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of megakaryocytes was lower in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except for a single case of hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in which the megakaryocytes were more abundant (3.6 per high-power field [hpf]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No micromegakaryocytes were observed in the 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mean number of megakaryocytes per hpf was lower in the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cases on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, on CD 61 staining the number of megakaryocytes per hpf increased in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Micromegakaryocytes were seen in scanty numbers in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> but increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and increased significantly on CD 61 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61, indicating the increased numbers of micromegakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, immunostaining is an efficient method of detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008254'>increased numbers of megakaryocytes</z:mp> and micromegakaryocytes that would ordinarily be missed by using routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
