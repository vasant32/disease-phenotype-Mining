<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced graft rejection but successfully underwent a second transplantation from the same donor with a slightly intensified conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the patient developed life-threatening cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> following the second transplantation, he recovered completely from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> with intensive supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He is still in complete remission past day 1000 in the absence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, this report is the first to describe a successful second transplantation that was performed for graft rejection following HLA-haploidentical nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we emphasize that patients should be carefully monitored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> when reduced-intensity conditioning is given repeatedly over a short period </plain></SENT>
