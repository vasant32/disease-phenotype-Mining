<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, prognostic scoring systems rely on observer-dependent assessments of blast percentage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling could enhance current diagnostic and prognostic systems by providing a set of standardized, objective gene signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the Microarray Innovations in LEukemia study, a diagnostic classification model was investigated to distinguish the distinct subclasses of pediatric and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the accuracy of the diagnostic classification model for subtyping <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was approximately 93%, but this was not reflected for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples giving only approximately 50% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discordant samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were classified either into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or "none-of-the-targets" (neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To clarify the discordant results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> submitted 174 MDS samples were externally reviewed, although this did not improve the molecular classification results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a significant correlation was noted between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and "none-of-the-targets" categories and prognosis, leading to a prognostic classification model to predict for time-dependent probability of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognostic classification model accurately discriminated patients with a rapid transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> within 18 months from those with more indolent disease </plain></SENT>
