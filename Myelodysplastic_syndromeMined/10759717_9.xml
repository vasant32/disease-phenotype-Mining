<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate further the effect of ATG on haemopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 patients (10 AA and 6 MDS) and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells were cultured in committed progenitor assay in the presence of ATG and autologous serum, then scored on day 14 for granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and erythroid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATG was found to be inhibitory to haemopoietic progenitor cells at high concentrations (1000 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by CD34-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and 7AAD staining of purified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells after overnight incubation with ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, at lower doses (0.1-10 microg/ml), ATG produced an increase in colony growth in most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA BM CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greatest effect was in patients with non-severe AA, in whom the greatest increase in CFU-GM was seen at 0.5 microg/ml (P &lt; 0.02) and 0.1 microg/ml (P = 0.02) and erythroid colonies at 0.1 microg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum ATG levels peaked during infusion to levels that were found to be toxic to haemopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and fell thereafter to levels that were associated with the highest colony numbers (0.1 and 0.5 microg/ml) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an increase in haemopoietic progenitor cells by ATG may be one of several important mechanisms for haematological recovery in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
