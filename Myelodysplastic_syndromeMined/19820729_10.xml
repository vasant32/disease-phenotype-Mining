<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the search for novel treatment strategies for these patients, we conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis and identified 22 patients treated with the DNA-methylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median number of two cycles 5-Aza (range 1-8) at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) over 5 days following relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (82%) also received a median number of two donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI, range 1-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (72%) responded to 5-Aza treatment and five patients (23%) achieved a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-Aza-induced CR lasted for 433 days (median, range 114-769) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival and the estimated 2-year survival rate were 144 days and 23%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved halving of leukocyte counts after the first 5-Aza cycle had a superior median survival of 802 days compared with 135 days (P=0.0025) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, the achievement of this halving of leukocyte counts was identified as a significant predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
