<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in combination with ciprofloxacin, after rapid diagnosis of V. vulnificus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that since V. vulnificus DNA can be detected by real-time PCR for several days even after patients receive antibiotics, real-time PCR for V. vulnificus is a very useful test for establishing an early diagnosis, even if a patient has been treated with antibiotics prior to admission </plain></SENT>
