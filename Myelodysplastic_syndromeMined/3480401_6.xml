<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differentiation induction therapy is an attractive therapeutic approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in the elderly, since it should be possible to increase the production of mature cells, at the expense of precursor cells, without incurring the complications of intensive cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single agent differentiation therapy has, however, not been highly successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have therefore investigated the use of synergistic combinations of agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We treated nine patients (6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> (up to 100 mg/m2/day) in combination with either 6-thioguanine (20-40 mg/day in 14-57 day courses) or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (1-2 mg as a single injection during a four-day course of RET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients responded with an increase in the mature cells of at least one haemopoietic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A concomitant decrease in marrow blasts was observed in 3/4 responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The retention of dysplastic and karyotypic abnormalities and lack of a hypoplastic phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggested that differentiation induction was occurring in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior failure to respond to therapy with single agents (RET in two and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> in five patients) suggests that the synergy observed in vitro operates in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-vitro studies on marrow cells from seven patients demonstrated synergistic differentiation induction in 6/7 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The seventh patient was one of the two who did not respond clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second of these clinically unresponsive patients had cells which were relatively refractory to RET in vitro, suggesting that in-vivo and in-vitro responses may be related </plain></SENT>
