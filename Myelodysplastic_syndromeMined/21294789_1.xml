<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of sex mismatch, especially the effect of Y chromosome mismatch in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) direction (female donors to male recipients: denoted as FtoM mismatch) on overall survival (OS) has been controversial and not examined out of the patient population in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 225 cases of allogeneic HSCT and showed that FtoM mismatch confers a highly significant impact on OS (P &lt; 0.005) in Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that this effect depends on the disease risk; for standard risk cases, this effect was significantly associated with poor outcome (for OS, P = 0.021), while for high risk cases, it had no effect on the results (for OS, P = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further showed that FtoM mismatch was associated with nonrelapse mortality (P = 0.019) and most of them were GVHD-related in standard risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FtoM mismatch has a significant impact on transplant outcome, especially in standard risk cases </plain></SENT>
