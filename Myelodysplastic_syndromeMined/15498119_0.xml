<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression levels of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 mRNA in MUTZ-1 cells were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed as follow: (1) Using 0.5 micromol/L, 1.0 micromol/L ACM treated cells for 24 hours, the relative expression level of cIAP-1 mRNA (cIAP-1/GAPDH) was lower than those in the untreated cell group (P=0.002, 0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Using 0.5 micromol/L ACM treated for 6, 12, 24 hours, the relative expression level of cIAP-1 mRNA was 0.95 +/- 0.04, 0.73 +/- 0.05, 0.38 +/- 0.07, respectively and the relative expression level of cIAP-1 mRNA was correlated negatively with the time treated by ACM (r=-0.996, P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) Using 0.5 micromol/L ACM treated for 3, 6, 12, 24 hours, the relative expression level of cIAP-2 mRNA was 1.17 +/- 0.06, 0.91 +/- 0.03, 0.69 +/- 0.07 and 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively and relative expression level of CIAP-2 mRNA was correlated negatively with the time treated by ACM (r=-0.091, P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(4) The percentages of TUNEL positive cells were correlated negatively with the relative expression level of CIAP1 and CIAP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (r=-0.984, -0.959 and P=0.002, 0.013 respectively) when treated with increasing concentration of ACM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ACM can induce significantly MUTZ-1 cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via suppressing expression of anti-apoptotic gene cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
