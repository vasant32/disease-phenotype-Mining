<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this therapy, and molecular markers useful to monitor the disease and the effect of the treatment are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">Phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) β1 is involved in both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, AZA as a single agent was able to induce PI-PLCβ1 expression, therefore providing a promising new tool in the evaluation of response to demethylating therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the efficacy of the combination of AZA and VPA on inducing PI-PLCβ1 expression in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed an increase in Cyclin D3 expression, a downstream target of PI-PLCβ1 signaling, therefore suggesting a potential combined activity of AZA and VPA in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in activating PI-PLCβ1 signaling, thus affecting cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings might open up new lines of investigations aiming at evaluating the role of the activation of PI-PLCβ1 signaling in the epigenetic therapy, which may also lead to the identification of innovative targets for the epigenetic therapy of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
