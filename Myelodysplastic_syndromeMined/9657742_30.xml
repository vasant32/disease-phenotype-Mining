<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the contributions of GATA-1 to definitive hematopoiesis in vivo, we have examined adult mice that were rendered genetically defective in GATA-1 synthesis (Takahashi et al, J Biol Chem 272:12611, 1997) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the GATA-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is randomly inactivated in every cell, heterozygous females can bear either an active <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant (referred to as GATA-1.05) GATA-1 allele, consequently leading to variable anemic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These heterozygous mutant mice usually developed normally, but they began to die after 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These affected animals displayed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes massively accumulated in the spleens of the heterozygotes, and we showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> resistance gene (which is the positive selection marker in ES cells) was expressed profusely in the abnormally abundant cells generated in the GATA-1.05 mutant females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed hematopoiesis outside of the bone marrow in the affected mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a small number of GATA-1.05 mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells begin to proliferate vigorously during early adulthood, but because the cells are unable to terminally differentiate, this leads to progenitor proliferation in the spleen and consequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, GATA-1 plays important in vivo roles for directing definitive hematopoietic progenitors to differentiate along both the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GATA-1 heterozygous mutant mouse shows a phenotype that is analogous to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and thus may serve as a useful model for this disorder </plain></SENT>
