<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, chemokine expression signatures have been reported to convey a prognostic value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the chemokine receptor repertoire on fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from 31 (22 low-risk and 9 high-risk) patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemokine receptor expression was studied in defined T-cell subsets using eight-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exhibited quantitative differences in peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, T cells obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients expressed a chemokine receptor pattern suggesting a dominance of mature and activated T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is illustrated by increased levels of CCR3, CCR5, CX3CR1 and/or by a decreased abundance of CCR7 in defined T-cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T-cell subset distribution appears to differ between the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, suggesting a preferential recruitment of specific T-cell subsets to the latter compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alteration in chemokine receptor expression can develop over time even in patients that are considered clinically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression levels of CXCR4 by CD8(+) cells were associated with prolonged patient survival and reduced numbers of bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> also involve chemokine receptors on different subsets of T cells, and that these changes may have a prognostic value </plain></SENT>
