<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to explore the correlation of Flt-3/ITD mutation to the occurrence of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and analyze its clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flt-3/ITD mutation status in bone marrow samples from 302 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, including 122 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 124 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 17 cases of juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>), and 39 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 122 AML patients, 98 (80.32%) had Flt-3 gene products in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flt-3/ITD mutation was detected in 21 (17.21%) of the 122 patients; the mutation rates were 42.86% (3/7) in M0, 22.22% (2/9) in M1, 12.90% (4/31) in M2, 44.44% (8/18) in M4, and 15.38% (4/26) in M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 124 ALL patients, 72 (58.06%) had Flt-3 gene products in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flt-3/ITD mutation was found in 2 (1.61%) of the 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing and Blast alignment revealed that ITD within exon 11 existed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, with various duplication regions and lengths (24-95 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No Flt-3/ITD mutation was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 AML patients with Flt3/ITD mutation, the median survival time was 13.5 months (0-47 months), which was significantly shorter than that of the patients without Flt-3/ITD mutation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of neutrophils in peripheral blood was similar in Flt-3/ITD-positive and Flt-3/ITD-negative patients (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chromosome karyotype analysis showed chromosome abnormity, including t(11; 12)(p15; q13), inv16(q21; q23), and t(6; 9)(p23; q23), in 3 AML patients with Flt-3/ITD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flt-3/ITD mutations are usually detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, seldom in ALL, not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Flt-3/ITD mutation is correlated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Flt-3/ITD is a significant marker to analyze <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
