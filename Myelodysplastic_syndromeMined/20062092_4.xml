<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 59 months, 21 patients (42%) were alive without evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By Kaplan-Meier analysis, year 1-4 disease-free survival (DFS) and OS estimates were 0.50/0.58, 0.40/0.46, 0.37/0.43 and 0.37/0.41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MUD recipients were engrafted quickly (13.5 days) compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> recipients (16 days) and relapsed/progressed less frequently (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) occurred in 26% in the absence of antecedent mucositis and was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) and poor OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive cGVHD developed in 51.2% of 100 day survivors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 14 survivors with cGVHD, 5 (35.7%) experienced resolution off immunosuppression, suggesting that tolerance with HLA matched grafts is possible at an advanced age by this method </plain></SENT>
