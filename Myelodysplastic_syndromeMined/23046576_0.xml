<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently gene expression profiling technique showed significant improvement in classifying some subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but the model's discriminating power of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is still in its infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Feature selection plays an important role in the classification of the samples on the basis of the gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis explains that a better choice of features could improve the classification of the diseased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stage samples, and the potential application of feature screening to produce feature sets, with better accuracies and lowest number of embedded features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed results suggest that feature selection proves to be an essential and affirmative step in the biomedical data mining models based on gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
