<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The results of randomized clinical trials have suggested that after receiving radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> have an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors set out to assess the reported association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> who were treated at a community-based institution since 1989 (updated annually for recurrence and/or vital status) was linked to the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to confirm complete ascertainment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases occurring within this registry population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were calculated for women who were treated for primary Stage 0-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> and had a follow-up duration of &gt; or = 24 months (n = 2866) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not undergo surgery (n = 5), patients for whom chemotherapy records were incomplete or who received nonstandard chemotherapy regimens (n = 69), patients who underwent stem cell transplantation (n = 83), and patients who were lost to follow-up or who had unknown disease status at follow-up (n = 81) were excluded from the analysis (total, n = 238) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> between 1992 and 1999, the crude overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> incidence rate was 0.28%, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) incidence rate was 0.11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up duration was 5.46 years (minimum, 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were documented (2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>National age-adjusted overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> incidence rates for the period 1996-1998 predict the occurrence of 9 cases (incidence rate, 0.31%) in the current cohort of women ages 21-94 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by treatment category was as follows: no surgery/no chemotherapy/no radiotherapy, 2 of 154 patients (1.30%); surgery/no chemotherapy/radiotherapy, 4 of 1403 patients (0.29%); surgery/chemotherapy/no radiotherapy, 0 of 352 patients (0%); and surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy, 2 of 957 patients (0.21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings reported from previous randomized clinical trials, the authors did not find evidence of increased posttreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> incidence in association with the use of chemotherapy, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
