<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a polymerase-chain-reaction-based assay for MSI between the initial and the most recently available ("latest") samples from 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 15 were informative at more than three microsatellite loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients showed an increase in leukemic cells while 8 patients did not during the interval between the two analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of the patients, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, which changed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, showed microsatellite alteration at the analysis times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 patients, two alterations were detected in the 42 informative paired samples that showed an increase in leukemic cells (4.8%), while none was detected in the 59 paired samples without such an increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, therefore only two alterations were detected among 101 informative paired samples (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that MSI is rare in the clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> irrespective of disease status, and is consequently not a critical genetic event for disease progression in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
