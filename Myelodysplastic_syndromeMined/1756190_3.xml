<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these agents partially increased peripheral blood granulocyte counts, their effect on other hematopoietic lineages was generally <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since in vitro analysis and in vivo studies in primates indicate that GM-CSF and IL-3 synergistically enhance hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, we evaluated their combined effect on marrow progenitors obtained from ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When used singly, each growth factor stimulated replication of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colony-forming cells in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When colony-stimulating activity was compared at concentrations that maximally amplified individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' colony numbers, IL-3 was a more potent stimulant in some patients and GM-CSF in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When used in combination, IL-3 plus GM-CSF was more effective than each growth factor by itself in five of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hematopoietic progenitor stimulatory effect of these growth factors varies from patient to patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of GM-CSF and IL-3 appears to be more potent than the individual molecules in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
