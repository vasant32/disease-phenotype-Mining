<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> there was a significant decrease in the percentages of promyelocytes and in Leu-M3-binding cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lue-M3 is mainly a monocyte marker, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> thus seem to induce a shift from monocytoid to myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts responded the most, and did also show a significant decrease in OKIa1-binding cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4913">Etretinate</z:chebi>, on the other hand, did not show any differentiation-inducing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results support earlier reports that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> might be useful in the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether this in vitro technique offers a possibility to predict the clinical outcome remains to be shown </plain></SENT>
