<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To refine the IPSS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient databases from international institutions were coalesced to assemble a much larger combined database (Revised-IPSS [IPSS-R], n = 7012, IPSS, n = 816) for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple statistically weighted clinical features were used to generate a prognostic categorization model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cytogenetics, marrow blast percentage, and cytopenias remained the basis of the new system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Novel components of the current analysis included: 5 rather than 3 cytogenetic prognostic subgroups with specific and new classifications of a number of less common cytogenetic subsets, splitting the low marrow blast percentage value, and depth of cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This model defined 5 rather than the 4 major prognostic categories that are present in the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient age, performance status, serum ferritin, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase were significant additive features for survival but not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This system comprehensively integrated the numerous known clinical features into a method analyzing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient prognosis more precisely than the initial IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, this IPSS-R should prove beneficial for predicting the clinical outcomes of untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and aiding design and analysis of clinical trials in this disease </plain></SENT>
