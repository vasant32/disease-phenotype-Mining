<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were investigated at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and four at transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using conventional cytogenetics, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was detected in nine cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 in two, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in five, either as a single aberration or as part of a complex clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case had both <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three biotinylated DNA probes directed against the pericentromeric region of chromosomes 7, 8 and 17, respectively, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow smears were first stained with May-Gr√ºnewald-Giemsa (MGG) for morphologic evaluation, and regions of interest documented by photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Later the same regions were targeted after hybridization, which allowed FISH analysis of selected bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each patient between 267 and 921 cells (mean 453) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most cases a majority of the non-lymphoid bone marrow cells appeared to be of clonal origin, ie showed either <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> by FISH, while in contrast both lymphocytes and plasma cells generally were disomic, ie displayed two fluorescent spots for each probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of clonal bone marrow cells differed greatly between patients, but in a single case there was a good agreement between the extent of granulocytic, monocytic and erythrocytic cell lineage involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In relation to the clinical stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, patients with more advanced disease had a significantly higher mean percentage of bone marrow blasts showing <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>, while disomic, possibly non-clonal cells were more frequent among the earlier forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-lymphoid bone marrow cells belonged to the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The FISH technique offers information regarding the distribution of clonal and non-clonal bone marrow cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which might have prognostic and possibly, therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
