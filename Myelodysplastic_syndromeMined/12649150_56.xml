<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Marrow cells of myeloid lineage from 115 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were characterized by multidimensional flow cytometry and compared with findings in 104 patients with various disorders and 25 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on phenotypic and scatter characteristics, a flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS) was developed that allowed for a simple numerical display of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometric scores were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/mild (0-1), moderate (2-3), or severe (&gt; or = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most flow cytometric abnormalities were significantly (P &lt;.05) more frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in the control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric scores in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were then retrospectively compared with marrow blast counts assessed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytogenetics, hematologic parameters, and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk categorization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometric scores correlated inversely with leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts (P &lt;.01) and correlated directly with IPSS scores (P &lt;.01) and with IPSS cytogenetic risk categories (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 111 MDS patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, flow scores correlated with posttransplantation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of posttransplantation relapse were 3%, 15%, and 33% for patients with mild, moderate, and severe FCSS scores, respectively (P &lt;.01), and overall survival was 74%, 40%, and 36%, respectively, for the 3 groups (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, there was a significant contribution of the flow score independent of the IPSS in predicting survival and relapse (P &lt;.01, P =.02, and P =.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that FCSS is useful in assessing marrows for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in determining the prognostic outcome in patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
