<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective review of 119 bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from patients 85 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These procedures were performed for a variety of abnormalities, including unexplained cytopenias; evaluation of a known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; suspicion or follow-up of plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>; and suspicion or staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When staging or follow-up biopsies were excluded, 34 (43%) of 79 yielded specific diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available for 45 patients, and of these 45, 20 patients received therapy: 17 were treated with an abbreviated or modified regimen, and 12 were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy failed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of these biopsies, relatively few patients received more than supportive treatment, suggesting that higher thresholds for biopsy for cytopenias may be indicated </plain></SENT>
