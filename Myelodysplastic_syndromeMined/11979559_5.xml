<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(11;20)(p15;q11) is a rare but recurrent translocation that so far has been described in only four <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>), two treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (t-MDSs), and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the t(11;20) was shown to result in a fusion of the NUP98 and TOP1 genes, with expression of the NUP98/TOP1 chimera encoded by the der(11)t(11;20), but not of the reciprocal TOP1/NUP98 on the der(20)t(11;20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genomic breakpoints were subsequently mapped to introns 13 and 7 of NUP98 and TOP1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here a t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a three-way variant translocation, t(10;20;11)(q24;q11;p15), that generates a der(11)t(11;20) but not a der(20)t(11;20), strongly suggesting that the der(11) harbors the critical genetic rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed a NUP98/TOP1 fusion in which exon 13 of NUP98 was fused in-frame with exon 8 of TOP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extra long (XL) genomic PCR and subsequent sequence analyses showed that the breakpoint in NUP98 occurred at nucleotide (nt) 3461 of intron 13, close to a MER (medium reiteration frequency interspersed repetitive element) repeat, and that the breakpoint in TOP1 was at nt 1436 of intron 7, downstream of a MIR (mammalian-wide interspersed repeats) repetitive element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic XL PCR did not amplify the reciprocal TOP1/NUP98, nor was this chimera expressed, as expected from the cytogenetic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results provide further support for the involvement of the NUP98/TOP1 transcript, but not of the reciprocal one, in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the three cases genomically characterized to date have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been treatment-related and have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> harbored breakpoints in intron 13 of NUP98 and intron 7 of TOP1, suggesting that these introns are susceptible to chemotherapy-induced breakage </plain></SENT>
