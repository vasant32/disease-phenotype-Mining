<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The perspective was that of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision-analytic model, based on a randomised phase III trial, was used to predict IFI avoided, life-years saved (LYS), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; incremental cost per LYS) over patients' lifetime horizon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data for the analyses included life expectancy, procedures, and costs associated with IFI and the drugs (in euros at November 2009 values) which were obtained from the published literature and opinions of an expert committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Posaconazole was associated with fewer IFI (0.05 versus 0.11), increased LYS (2.52 versus 2.43), and significantly lower costs excluding costs of the underlying condition (€6,121 versus €7,928) per patient relative to SAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is an 85% probability that posaconazole is a cost-saving strategy compared to SAT and a 97% probability that the ICER for posaconazole relative to SAT is below the cost per LYS threshold of €30,000 currently accepted in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Posaconazole is a cost-saving prophylactic strategy (lower costs and greater efficacy) compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> in high-risk neutropenic patients </plain></SENT>
