<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the patient had previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were probably related to such therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential karyotypic analysis established a del(5q) as the initial cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional alterations, including t(10;13)(q24;q14), had developed subsequently during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of OHN-GM cells suggested deletion of one allele of the IRF-1 gene, although no aberrant transcripts were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed the deletion of the Rb gene due to the t(10;13)(q24;q14) translocation, and Western blot analysis demonstrated the absence of Rb protein in OHN-GM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the OHN-GM cells exhibited two missense point mutations in highly conserved regions of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that a multistep process, involving alterations of Rb and p53 genes, may have contributed to the patient's disease development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, OHN-GM is the first cell line derived from a therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cells may aid the investigation of leukaemogenesis as well as the biology of secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
