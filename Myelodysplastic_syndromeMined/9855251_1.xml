<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiovascular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> are scanty but may have clinical significance in predicting late cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we evaluated prospectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurohumoral and cardiovascular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> containing induction chemotherapy in 10 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">Idarubicin</z:chebi> was administered intravenously 12 mg/m2 on d 1, 3 and 5 as a part of the induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of plasma atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) were performed at baseline and the day following each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac systolic and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signal averaged electrocardiography (ECG) was recorded to observe myocardial late potentials associated with possible myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, ambulatory ECG recording was performed to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of ANP increased from 18.2 +/- 1.5 pmol/l to 27.8 +/- 3.5 pmol/l (p = 0.011), to 30.2 +/- 3.0 pmol/l (p = 0.002) and to 40.8 +/- 6.0 pmol/l (p = 0.006) after the first, second and third doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, plasma concentration of BNP increased from 6.2 +/- 1.9 to 9.0 +/- 1.8 pmol/l (p = 0.049) and 17.5 +/- 8.1 pmol/l (p = 0.203) after the first and third <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, there was a trend towards an increase in left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (50.2 +/- 1.8 to 54.4 +/- 2.2 mm, p = 0.070) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase in plasma BNP concentrations correlated significantly with the increase in LVEDD (r = 0.624; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant ECG changes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> infusions except in 1 patient who developed abnormal myocardial late potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurohumoral activation associated with increased LVEDD indicating subclinical myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
