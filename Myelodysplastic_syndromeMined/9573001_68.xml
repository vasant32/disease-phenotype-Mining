<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (EBV-LPD) is a serious and potentially fatal complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate levels of EBV DNA in SCT patients, a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and diluted, and PCR was performed by using a primer set specific for a well-conserved sequence of the internal repeat 1 region of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-one SCT patients were screened with this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients received allogeneic transplants, of which 18 were T-cell-depleted marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four additional patients received autologous SCT, one of which was T-cell depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time of follow-up by EBV PCR was 147 days (range, 47 to 328 days) posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The range of EBV copies/microg DNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EBV sero-positive donors was 40 to 4,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had &gt;/=40,000 copies of EBV DNA/microg DNA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were recipients of T-cell-depleted SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven patients with elevated levels of EBV DNA developed EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of these five patients with EBV-LPD had elevated levels of EBV DNA from 1 to 8 weeks before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients with EBV-LPD had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of EBV DNA, and two patients with &gt;/=40,000 copies EBV/microg DNA did not develop EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In one patient, clinical resolution of disease correlated with a decrease in EBV DNA and an increase in the level of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the measurement of EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load with semiquantitative PCR is useful in detecting EBV-LPD in high-risk patients before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with elevated levels of EBV DNA develop EBV-LPD, semiquantitative PCR results cannot substitute for clinical, radiographic, and pathological confirmation of this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
