<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The last dividing stages of the erythroid lineage--polychromatophylic erythroblasts--characterized by the presence of micronucleoli exhibited significantly larger values of the nucleolar coefficient in specimens stained for AgNOR proteins than in those stained for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, both these and terminal non-dividing nucleated stages of the erythroid lineage--orthochromatic erythroblasts--possessed micronucleoli after staining for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in a much smaller percentage of cells than after staining for AgNOR proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, both these observations indicate that micronucleoli in the course of terminal maturation of erythroblasts apparently lose the nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> detectable by the light microscopic cytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, silver-stained micronucleoli--nucleolar remnants--were also noted in erythroblasts expelling the nucleus </plain></SENT>
