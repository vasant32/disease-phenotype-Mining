<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A review of patients with myeloid disorders presenting to a large cytogenetic referral centre over a ten year period was undertaken to assess the clinical relevance of the presence of del(20q) in their malignant karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were identified, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>), 15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of del(20q) in four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> did not appear to adversely affect survival, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients alive 18 to 184 months post diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had a median survival of only 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> including three of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> de novo and del(20q), six were treated with only two achieving complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of survival for these seven patients was 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results, when compared with published survival data from the MIC Cooperative Group, indicated that del(20q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is associated with a high rate of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, del(20q) is associated with a poor response to treatment and reduced survival </plain></SENT>
