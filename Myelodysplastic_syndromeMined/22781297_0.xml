<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 97 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received HAG regimen as the induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients was 52.3% (45/86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response (OR) rate was 66.3% (57/86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early mortality rate was 9.3% (9/97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in CR rate and OR rate between the patients aged â‰¥ 60 and those &lt; 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR rate was 29/34, 9/12 and 6/13 in patients with favorable karyotype, intermediate karyotype and unfavorable karyotype respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR rate was higher in patients with favorable karyotype than those with unfavorable karyotype (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major adverse effect was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HAG regimen provides higher CR rate and OR rate for patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
