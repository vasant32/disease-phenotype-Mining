<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increasing number of blast cells in the bone marrow correlate with poor prognosis and risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such progression is frequently associated with increasing chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 75 MDS patients were investigated for <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, FMS and p53 mutations, and these molecular findings were related to cytogenetics, clinical status, transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, prognostic scores and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mutation incidence of 57% (43/75) was found, with 48% (36/75) <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations, 12% (9/75) FMS mutations and 8% (4/50) p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation status for <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and FMS was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroup, increasing with poor-risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence was in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations were of codon 12 and a predominance of FMS codon 969 mutations was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increased frequency of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients harboring <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> or FMS mutations (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with oncogene mutations had a significantly poorer survival compared with those without mutations at 2 years and at the end of the period of follow-up (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including mutation, age, gender, diagnosis (FAB), cytogenetics and International score shows that the International score and mutation and age is the best predictive model of a poor outcome, (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was undertaken without the International score, mutation and gender was the best predictor of poor survival (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study shows that oncogene mutation, indicative of genetic instability, is associated with disease progression and poor survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
