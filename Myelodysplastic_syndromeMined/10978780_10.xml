<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolic acid</z:chebi>, to induce differentiation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and U937 leukemic cells as well as in fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from patients with non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil reduced the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>) levels and induced morphologic and functional differentiation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and U937 cells dose-dependently </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes became evident when the intracellular <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> levels decreased to approximately 20-30% of the untreated control level and were abrogated by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the fresh leukemic cells, differentiation induction was shown in the cells derived from seven of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
