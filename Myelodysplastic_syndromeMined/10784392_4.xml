<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-clinical data suggest a synergistic activity with DNA damaging agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, where topotecan might prevent the repair of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus designed a combination including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 500 mg/m2 every 12 hours given on days 1 to 3; topotecan 1.25 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on days 2 to 6, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) 2 g/m2 over 4 hours daily for 5 days on days 2 to 6 (CAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty six (63 evaluable) patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty two patients had refractory (n=12) or relapsed (n=40) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and eleven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (refractory n=3, relapsed n=8); their median age was 57 years (range, 18 to 79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (17%) achieved a complete remission (CR), and two patients (3%) had a hematologic improvement (HI; met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria for CR except for platelets &lt; 100x10(9)/L), for an overall response rate of 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses occurred in 12 of 52 AML patients (23%), including 10 CR (19%) and 2 HI (4%), and in 1 of 11 patients with ALL (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was universal; there were 23 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and 18 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin complicating 74 courses of CAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-hematologic toxicity was mostly gastrointestinal, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and mucositis, but was severe in only 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the CAT regimen is well tolerated and has significant anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> activity which warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
