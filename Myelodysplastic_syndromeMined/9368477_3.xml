<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic relevance of these dysplastic features for patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, bone marrow aspirates from 69 patients were analyzed prospectively and investigated separately for erythropoiesis, granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis by three independent investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 48.8% and partial remission (PR) or nonresponders constituted 52.2% of the patients investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival time was 5 months with a disease-free interval of 3.5 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysgranulopoiesis (DysG) was observed in 30.4%, dysmegakaryopoiesis (DysM) in 50.7%, and dyserythropoiesis (DysE) in 43.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 26.0% showed trilineage dysplastic features and were thus classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TLMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly worse prognosis (Kaplan-Meyer plot, Student's t-test) was calculated for those patients with detection of only DysG (p = 0.002), DysM (p = 0.02), DysE (p = 0.04) as compared with patients without any dysplastic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unfavorable karyotype was correlated with patients showing DysG (P = 0.02) and DysM (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For these patients with an unfavorable karyotype, the occurrence of any dysplastic features had no additional prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic features (DysG, DysM, DysE) seem to be an important prognostic factor in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> correlating with short overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DysG and DysM correlated well with the appearance of unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be reasonable to assume that patients with dysplastic features should be considered for more aggressive treatment schedules at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
