<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that this occurs through an interruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell cycle progression during anaphase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism(s) controlling this unique process is undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we examine the effect of an Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656, on thrombopoietin (TPO)-induced growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, when SU6656 (2.5 microM) was added to a megakaryocytic cell line, UT-7/TPO, the cells ceased cell division but continued to accumulate DNA by endomitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this interval, CD41 and CD61 expression on the cell surface increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar effects on polyploidization and MK differentiation were seen with expanded primary MKs, bone marrow from 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and other cell lines with MK potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that SU6656 might be useful as a differentiation-inducing agent for MKs and is an important tool for understanding the molecular basis of MK endomitosis </plain></SENT>
