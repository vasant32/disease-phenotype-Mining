<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The central reviewers independently examined the bone marrow and peripheral blood smears of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and classify the disease according to the French-British-American (FAB) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 117 eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 16-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio was 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two percent of the patients were younger than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the FAB subtypes was RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 54.7; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 23.1; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, 9.4; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 12.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was the most common symptom presenting in 84.6% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 34 patients in whom the cytogenetics in the bone marrow were analysed, 44.1% revealed abnormalities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfusions were the main therapeutic modality in 80% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a 5 year survival rate of 29% for the whole group with a median survival of 24 months </plain></SENT>
