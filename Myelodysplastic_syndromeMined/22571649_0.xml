<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report updates that case study at a 7-year follow-up, and compared the impact on overall survival of erythroid response to known prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The erythroid response duration (median 17 months; 22 in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients, with 20% patients in response after 6 years of therapy) was longer than in most studies with erythropoietin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (median 55 months in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 15 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB1</z:e> patients) was negatively affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB1</z:e> diagnosis, IPSS and WPSS intermediate scores and transfusion-dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, erythroid response maintained an independent positive impact on survival, particularly in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients in the first 3 years from diagnosis (90% survival compared to 50% of non-responders) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the long-term follow-up confirmed the achievement, by our combined treatment, of fairly long-lasting erythroid response in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with unfavourable prognostic features for response to erythropoietin: this translated in a survival benefit that was independent from other prognostic features </plain></SENT>
