<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The perturbation of ferritin function may result in accumulation of excess iron in cells and tissues and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, common features of different genetic and acquired disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in L-ferritin have been associated with neuroferritinopathy, a rare and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> with abnormal brain iron storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel form of ferritin has been discovered, which localizes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrix and plays an important role in iron homeostasis in these organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible association of sequence variations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ferritin (FtMt) gene with disorders with aberrant iron distribution has not been investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We set up a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)-based screening for FtMt and analyzed the genomic DNA of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (# 63) or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (# 332) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16454,29032">pantothenate</z:chebi> kinase-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> (# 7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome</z:e> (# 23), and suspected neuroferritinopathy (# 7) and of control subjects (# 342) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We detected eight different types of substitution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> at the heterozygous state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of them caused amino acid changes, but none of them was predicted to drastically perturb FtMt structure and/or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The c + 134C &gt; A (P45H) variation, which was the most common (# 28), was less represented in the Parkinson's population, although not significantly (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis suggests that sequence variations in the coding region of FtMt are not involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
