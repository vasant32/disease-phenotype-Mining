<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the cases of two unrelated patients who exhibited multiple chromosomal abnormalities in donor cells after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, respectively, and both underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and fludarabine followed by PBSCT from their HLA-matched opposite-sex siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant bone marrow cytogenetics showed full engraftment, and the early post-transplant studies demonstrated only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies of both patients, however, revealed a population of metaphase cells with abnormal, but apparently balanced, donor karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome studies performed on peripheral blood cells collected from both donors after transplantation were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients remained in clinical remission during follow-up of approximately 8 years in one case, and 6 years in the other case, despite the persistence of the abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities in residual recipient cells after bone marrow or PBSCT are not unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only rare reports of chromosome abnormalities in donor cells exist, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which have been associated with post-bone marrow transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present cases demonstrate the rare phenomenon of persistent clonal nonpathogenic chromosome aberrations in cells of donor origin </plain></SENT>
