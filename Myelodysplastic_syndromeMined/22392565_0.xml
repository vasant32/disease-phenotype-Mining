<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children who are treated for myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (DS) experience superior survival compared with children who have myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> without DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To maintain excellent outcomes while avoiding toxicity, the Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (COG) conducted the phase 3 trial COG A2971, the first trial solely designed to provide uniform treatment of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in North American children with DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A2971 eliminated 2 induction drugs and 3 months of maintenance therapy from the standard-timing regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, 6-thioguanine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and rubidomycin/daunomycin (DCTER) used in the previous study (Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group [CCG] 2891) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: COG A2971 was a multi-institutional, nonrandomized, clinical trial that enrolled 132 patients who had DS with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 91) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.8 years (range, 0.8-8.6 years), the median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (range, 0.3-13.6 years), and the median white blood cell count was 6200/μL (range, 900-164,900/μL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remission rate (92.7% ± 6%) was similar to that reported in the CCG 2891 study (91.3% �� 5%; P = .679) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event free survival (EFS) rate was 79% ± 7% (vs 77% ± 7% in CCG 2891; P = .589), the disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 89% ± 6% (vs 85% ± 6% in CCG 2891; P = .337), and the overall survival rate was 84% ± 6% (vs 79% ± 7% in CCG 2891; P = .302) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction day-14 bone marrow response trended toward a more favorable outcome (EFS: P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;4 years was an adverse risk factor (5-year EFS rate: 33% ± 38% for children aged &gt;4 years [median, 8.5 years; n = 6] vs 81% ± 7% for children ages 0-4 years [median, 1.7 years; n = 126]; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The COG A2971 trial reduced the chemotherapy dose and maintained survival to that achieved by the CCG 2891 trial in children who had myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated with DS </plain></SENT>
