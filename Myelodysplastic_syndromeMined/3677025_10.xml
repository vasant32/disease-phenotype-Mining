<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By stepwise analysis, the variables found to have prognostic significance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were as follows: age, percentage of marrow blasts, presence of circulating blasts, and number of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variables found significant for predicting progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) were as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, percentage of marrow blasts, and presence of circulating blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group of 193 patients was used to build a prognostic index which reflected the probability of a given patient dying or progressing to AL within 6, 9, or 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The application of this prognostic index to a test group of 143 patients was used to determine the expected error rate and the validity of the prediction rule </plain></SENT>
