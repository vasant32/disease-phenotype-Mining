<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of WRN in the Japanese population, 1 in 200,000, is higher than than that in the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic defect of WRN is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But genetic linkage to several markers on the short arm of chromosome 8 has been reported recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied one family with WRN in which an affected individual had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002895'>papillary thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using 4 microsatellites closely located to the WRN locus: D8S360, D8S1055, D8S339 and ANK1, we analyzed the genotypes of this patient, her three siblings and her parents, who were first cousins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutative haplotype, identified through the generations in pedigree, helps detect a carrier or a presymptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The eldest sister inherited two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haplotypes, but the second sister inherited one mutative haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in clinical signs and symptoms between these sisters. when the WRN gene is isolated, it will help us understand the mechanism of aging </plain></SENT>
