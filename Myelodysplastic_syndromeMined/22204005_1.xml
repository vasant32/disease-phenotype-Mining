<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although total hip arthroplasty is one of the most common orthopaedic surgical procedures, it remains unclear whether histopathological examination of the excised femoral head adds to the quality of patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose that assessment of femoral heads resected during total hip arthroplasty and donated for allograft use may provide a profile of femoral head pathology that benefits total hip arthroplasty patients and bone donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the histological findings reported for 6161 femoral heads donated for allograft use between 1993 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens obtained during total hip arthroplasty and specimens donated at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up investigations that resulted from abnormal histopathological findings were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Western Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry was used to determine whether patients with a suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were subsequently diagnosed with such a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of the histopathological findings was conducted to evaluate and reclassify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previous observations of abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and five femoral heads demonstrated abnormal or reactive histopathological features not reported prior to surgery and were rejected for allograft use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reactive lymphocytic infiltrate, most likely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo>, was the most commonly identified feature (forty-five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other features observed in twenty-seven cases were also most likely due to the presence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten femoral heads demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e>, which may have been related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget's disease</z:e>, and two, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had a suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these nineteen, eight cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were confirmed on further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One subsequently confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was detected per 770 femoral heads examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that, even with a detailed medical history and careful physical examination, clinically important diseases including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget's disease</z:e> are observed in patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> prior to total hip arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Histological examination plays an integral role in quality assurance in femoral head banking, and it also represents a possible early diagnostic test for bone and bone-marrow-related diseases in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
