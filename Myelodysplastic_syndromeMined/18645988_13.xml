<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the depth of cytopenias to determine whether this parameter could further refine the prognostic ability of the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation was determined between the depth of cytopenias in 816 patients from the International <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Risk Analysis Workshop database and patients' clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), absolute neutrophil count, and platelet depth levels were assessed relative to the IPSS risk groups, refined French-American-British categories, cytogenetic groups, bone marrow blast percentage (%), age groups, overall survival (OS), and time to evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of different cytopenic levels was performed to determine whether depth of cytopenias was prognostically additive to the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cytopenic categories had statistically significant rank correlations with IPSS, bone marrow blast %, and refined French-American-British categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, Hb levels had additive prognostic value to the IPSS for evaluation of OS, but not time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, with greatest prognostic value in Intermediate-1 and Intermediate-2 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, platelet or absolute neutrophil count levels alone or in combination lacked additive prognostic value to the IPSS regarding OS or time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The depth of Hb level per se at the time of diagnosis has additive predictive value to the IPSS for OS in the intermediate-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This information should prove useful for aiding therapeutic decision-making, prognostic classification, and designing clinical trials for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
