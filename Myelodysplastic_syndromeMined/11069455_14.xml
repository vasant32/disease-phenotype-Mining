<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate clinicopathological features of a series of such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients with LC were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blast in transformation, three had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in leukaemic phase, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cutaneous lesions were widely dispersed in 15 patients, but were restricted to the extremities in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other patients lesions were localized on the face, hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous lesions were generally erythematous, maculopapular, squamous, nodular, haemorrhagic or necrotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two localizations were very interesting: in one case, lesions were confined to the site of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0586989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella zoster virus infection</z:e>; in the other case, leukaemic infiltration occurred within a lesion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cutaneous leishmaniasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had high white blood cell count and/or other findings of high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> with leukaemic cell infiltration (LV) was detected in 24 patients, and was high-grade LV in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-grade LV tended to have a higher white blood cell count and other findings associated with an aggressive clinical course compared with patients not having LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with LV died within 1 month but five patients lived more than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LC, and especially LV, is generally an indicator of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis must be evaluated further with additional studies, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, angiogenic factors and other biological parameters </plain></SENT>
