<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 28 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> who relapsed 6 to 24 months from completion of treatment (14 patients) or who were refractory to first-line therapy or relapsed very early (14 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 28 patients were treated with salvage chemotherapy plus a conditioning regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBCST) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 35.5 months (range 14-119), of the 14 patients responding to first-line therapy but who relapsed &gt; 6 months off therapy, 10 (72%) are alive, well and in complete remission (CR), 2 (14%) are alive with disease at 39 and 83 months from transplant, and 2 (14%) died 26 and 63 months after their transplant from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 39 months, the overall survival (OS) is 68% and the event-free survival (EFS) is 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 30 months (1-98), of the 14 patients refractory to first-line therapy or who relapsed very early, 9 (64%) are alive in CR, 1 (7%) is alive with disease and 4 (29%) have died of their disease (3 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OS is 58% and the EFS is 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are no statistically significant differences in terms of OS and EFS between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that salvage chemotherapy followed by a conditioning regimen and autotransplant is an effective, feasible and well-tolerated scheme of therapy not only for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> who relapse after first-line treatment, but also for those resistant to first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
