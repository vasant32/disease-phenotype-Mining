<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to lower the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD we used CD34 marrow cell selection for T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> has been linked to an increased risk of relapse and an increased risk of marrow failure, we used PCR amplification of minisatellite sequences to investigate donor cell engraftment and RT-PCR amplification of recurrent chromosomal translocations to investigate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients who underwent BMT after positive selection of the CD34-positive cell population were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were then compared with those of 37 patients who underwent transplantation with unmanipulated marrow graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 patients who received CD34+ selected cell grafts, seven (30%) had evidence of full donor engraftment, 14 had evidence of residual recipient cells (61%), one had a non-take, and one autologous bone marrow recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the chimaerism status post-transplant in 36 patients who received unmanipulated marrow grafts showed that 31 patients (86%) had evidence of full donor engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in the incidence of mixed chimaerism profile between patients who received unmanipulated marrow graft and those receiving CD34+ selected cell grafts was statistically significant (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients who received CD34+ selected cell grafts could be analysed for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> post-transplant (one with t(9;22) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and eight with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patient transplanted for a Ph-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, and in two out of the eight patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, the search fora fusion transcript was consistently negative after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the six patients with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e>, three patients also had a mixed chimaerism profile and were given donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">Minimal residual disease</z:e> study was performed post-transplant in 16 patients who received unmanipulated marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 10 of 14 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> the search for a fusion transcript was consistently negative after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> between patients who received an unmanipulated marrow graft and those receiving CD34+ selected cell grafts was not statistically significantly significant, but numbers of patients included in this analysis are still few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study highlights the strong influence of graft manipulation on the incidence of mixed chimaerism after transplantation from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
