<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This novel technique enables quantitative and direct analysis of cytogenetic alterations in nondividing cells of distinct cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and one patient with a translocation (1;7) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For cell lineage determination, antibodies specific for progenitor cells (CD34), myeloid cells (CD15), monocytes (63D3), T cells (CD3), and B cells (CD19,20,22) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, BM cells were available and the erythroid lineage could be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For detection of cytogenetic aberrations, we used chromosome-specific repetitive DNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonlymphoid cells carried the cytogenetic abnormality; in two patients, mosaicism within these lineages was suggested by the relative low numbers (35% to 55%) of aberrant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the T or B cells of the five patients carried the chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that combined immunophenotyping and in situ hybridization is a feasible technique to study lineage involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the chromosomal aberrations studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are restricted to the myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
