<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if multidrug resistance may contribute to chemoresistance in these disorders, we studied bone marrow specimens for P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression (P-GP) by immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies reactive with cytoplasmic (C219) or surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (MRK16) of P-GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five case specimens from 43 patients were studied, including 32 cases of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, seven cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and six therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was available on 36 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two staining patterns were detected: (1) cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and (2) staining restricted primarily to the nuclear-cytoplasmic junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P-GP was detected in seven (22%) cases of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, four (57%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolving from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and five (83%) cases of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of P-GP was restricted to blasts and leukaemic monocytes, and was otherwise absent from terminally differentiated blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the relation between P-GP expression and reactivity with the human progenitor cell antigen CD34, revealed a highly significant association (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-GP reactivity was distributed equally among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal karyotypes and did not correlate with specific cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that multidrug resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and karyotypically-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> is closely linked to a stem <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and may contribute to chemoresistance in these disorders </plain></SENT>
