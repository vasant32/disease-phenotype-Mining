<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: N-ras mutations are the most commonly detected molecular abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, especially in those of myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different techniques have been used to detect N-ras mutations; however, most of them are either labor intensive or provide sequence data for only a limited number of codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, study of the N-ras oncogene has not been convenient in every day clinical practice being restricted, as a rule, to retrospective analysis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study we used a recently developed method that enables rapid and reliable detection of mutations at the cDNA level, namely, the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this method we were able to screen the N-ras oncogene rapidly and determine the incidence and prognostic significance of N-ras mutations in 77 Greek patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, both at the presentation and during relapse or progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activating N-ras mutations were detected in 7 patients and our results were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, two novel alterations were identified, a mutation at codon 8 (characterized by a substitution of valine by leucine) in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> during hematologic relapse of the disease and a polymorphism at codon 92 (1002T--&gt;C, without amino acid substitution) in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and easy protocol that allows the analyses of N-ras sequences has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/NIRCA protocol can allow the study of this proto-oncogene in every day clinical practice, rapidly facilitating the validation of the diagnostic and prognostic value of N-ras mutational analyses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
