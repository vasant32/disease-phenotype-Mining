<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Only a handful of cases of chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (CI-HHV-6) have been reported, suggesting that this phenomenon is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here present a familial case of HHV-6 variant A (HHV-6A) transmission through a generation, which was identified in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 31-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> underwent allogeneic HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling, and was found to be continuously yielding high copy numbers of HHV-6A DNA in plasma evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antiviral therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> or foscarnet failed to decrease the copy numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HHV-6A DNA was detected in the patient's buccal mucosa and hair follicles, and was also detected in the plasma, whole blood, and buccal mucosa of the patient's father and 2 siblings, but not in his mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequences of HHV-6A DNA isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since monitoring of HHV-6 by PCR has been widely introduced to the field of HSCT, transplant physicians should be aware of such an alternative form of HHV-6 transmission, particularly when HHV-6A is detected </plain></SENT>
