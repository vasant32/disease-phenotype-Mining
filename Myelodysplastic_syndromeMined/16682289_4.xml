<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further pinpoint these deletions, we have performed a detailed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) analysis with precisely mapped BAC probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with a sole cytogenetically visible del(5q) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proximal deletion endpoints were localized between 75 and 86 megabases (Mb) (5q13, five times), 86 and 96 Mb (5q14 approximately q15, four times), and at various sites in the other four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distal breakpoints mapped between 153 and 155 Mb (5q33.2, five times), 156 and 158 Mb (5q33.3, three times), 158 and 164 Mb (5q34, two times), and 164 and 181 Mb (telomere) in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The largest deletion was approximately 70 Mb and the smallest was 43 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies show that cytogenetically similar appearing deletions in 5q are highly variable in molecular terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with a blast count between 0 and 13%, cells with a del(5q) were present in 24-90% of interphase (nondividing) cells and in 30-100% of metaphase (dividing) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with a blast count of 30 and 80%, del(5q) was found in 35 and 95% interphase cells and 95 and 100% of metaphase cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that a low blast count can be associated with a high proportion of 5q- cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
