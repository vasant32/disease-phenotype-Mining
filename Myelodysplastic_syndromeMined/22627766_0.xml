<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eltrombopag (EP) is a small-molecule, nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> that has been approved recently for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior studies have shown that EP stimulates megakaryopoiesis in BM cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and the results also suggested that it may inhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we studied the effects of EP on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell proliferation and the mechanism of its antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that EP leads to a decreased cell division rate, a block in G(1) phase of cell cycle, and increased differentiation in human and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because EP is species specific in that it can only bind TPO-R in human and primate cells, these findings further suggested that the antileukemic effect is independent of TPO-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that treatment with EP leads to a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experimental increase of intracellular iron abrogated the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects of EP, demonstrating that its antileukemic effects are mediated through modulation of intracellular iron content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, determination of EP's antileukemic activity in vivo demonstrated its ability to prolong survival in 2 mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
