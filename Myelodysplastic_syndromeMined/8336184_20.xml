<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1988 and October 1989, 142 patients were eligible for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients entered received a timing-intensive five-drug induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C), thioguanine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DCTER) over 4 days with a second cycle administered after 6 days of rest, irrespective of hematologic status at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients subsequently received a second two-cycle induction course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those who achieved remission were eligible for bone marrow ablative therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, followed by 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29792">hydroperoxy</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (4-HC)-purged autologous or allogeneic BMT rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eight (76%) patients achieved remission: 19 (13%) died of complications of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and/or chemotherapy, and 15 (11%) failed to achieve remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four patients subsequently underwent BMT with either autologous (n = 58) or allogeneic (n = 16) rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients who received autologous rescue with 4-HC-purged grafts, the actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 years from the day of transplant is 51%, compared with 55% for patients who received allogeneic grafts (P = .92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, the overall actuarial survival rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 142 patients entered on this study is 45%, with an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse prognostic factors for outcome included an elevated WBC count or the presence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest that aggressively timed induction therapy followed by marrow ablation and BMT rescue with either autologous or allogeneic grafts for children with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is both feasible and effective </plain></SENT>
