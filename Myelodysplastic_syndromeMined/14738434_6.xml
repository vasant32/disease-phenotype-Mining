<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of 979 adult patients (3.2%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> were identified as having near-triploid or near-tetraploid (tri-/tetraploid) chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included 11 with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, seven with Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, five with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion of one allele of the p53 gene was found in two patients and a point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although abnormalities of the p53 gene have been reported in about 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, these were found in seven of 31 (23%) patients with tri-/tetraploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the abnormality of the p53 gene may be closely related with tri-/tetraploidy </plain></SENT>
