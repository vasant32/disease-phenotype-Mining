<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Specific NRAS oncogene missense mutations have been frequently found in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e>, especially in those of myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a wide range of PCR-based methods for screening and detection of NRAS exon 1 single-base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are disadvantages and ambiguities associated with these techniques because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them require either separate probes, separate PCR amplifications, or complicated post-PCR manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes a new approach for detection of NRAS gene mutations at codon 12 and 13 based on the DNA heteroduplex analysis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strategy relies upon differential electrophoretic behavior of induced heteroduplex molecules formed by cross-hybridization of two PCR-amplified species, the sample under analysis and the synthetic universal heteroduplex generator (UHG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The screening of a panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> codon 12 and 13 NRAS mutant DNA variants indicated that this approach discriminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 relevant mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the method was estimated by a competitive assay where mutant alleles could be detected at a dilution level of 1 to 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This UHG technology was tested on some clinical samples previously studied by PCR-ASO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methodology is highly specific, sensitive, and achieves an appreciable reduction in workload and time because it requires one PCR amplification followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis in standard conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that this new approach may be applied as an alternative strategy for codon 12-13 NRAS mutations and it could be easily incorporated into the range of routine assays performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> laboratories </plain></SENT>
