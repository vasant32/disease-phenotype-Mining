<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To probe the expression level of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in malignant clone cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase, APAAP) was used to detect the expression of IGF-IR in the bone marrow cells of 40 MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average IGF-IR expression level on the clone cells \[(84.5 ± 14.2)%\] from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases was markedly elevated compared to the corresponding level on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells \[(11.4 ± 12.1)%\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And the percentages of malignant clone cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 40 MDS cases were significantly correlated with the relevant percentages of IGF-IR positive nucleated cells (r = 0.929, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IGF-IR might be taken as a marker of clone cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for its trait to malignant proliferation </plain></SENT>
