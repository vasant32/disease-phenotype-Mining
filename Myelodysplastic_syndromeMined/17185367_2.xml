<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-density microarrays are powerful tools for expression analysis of thousands of genes simultaneously; however, experience with low-density microarrays in gene expression studies has been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed an optimized procedure for gene expression analysis based on a microarray containing 538 oligonucleotides and used this procedure to analyze neoplastic cell lines and whole-blood samples from healthy individuals and patients with different hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering and the Welch t-test with adjusted P values were used for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This procedure detects 0.2 fmol of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and generates a linear response of 2 orders of magnitude, with CV values of &lt;20% for hybridization and label replicates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant differences between Jurkat and U937 cell lines, between blood samples from 15 healthy donors and 59 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) samples, and between 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A classification system constructed from the expression data predicted healthy or CLL status from a whole-blood sample with a 97% success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of whole-blood samples was carried out without any cellular or sample manipulation before <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This gene expression analysis procedure uncovered statistically significant differences associated with different hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and made possible the construction of a classification system that predicts the healthy or CLL status from a whole-blood sample </plain></SENT>
