<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was started with low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our case shows that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
