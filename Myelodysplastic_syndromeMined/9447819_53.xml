<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An enhanced expression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TNF-alpha was observed in most of the samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (11/14, 79%), whereas no enhancement was observed in bone marrow samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (0/6), <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (0/2) or control cases (0/8) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination confirmed the scattered presence of TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma producing cells in the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of these cells were CD68-positive macrophage lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that disruption of hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> might be caused by enhanced production of inhibitory regulatory cytokines especially TNF-alpha and occasionally IFN-gamma by bone marrow macrophages </plain></SENT>
