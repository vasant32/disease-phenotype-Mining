<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a case of co-existent de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and T-cell NHL, including clinical features, histopathological findings, molecular assessment, treatment course and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other cases from the literature showing co-existence of both disorders are also reviewed; to date 19 similar cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (including the present patient), eight cases were diagnosed with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and NHL simultaneously, which were considered to be true coincidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms responsible for the appearance of co-existence have not yet been ascertained, however in the present case a common chromosomal abnormality (20q deletion) was found in bone marrow and lymph node preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude, therefore, that the co-existent de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and T-cell NHL seen in the present case may have a common origin </plain></SENT>
