<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Similar to two other hematopoietic growth factor receptors, the c-fms (macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor) and the c-kit genes, c-mpl has been discovered through the study of oncogenic retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike c-fms and c-kit, which both belong to a subgroup of tyrosine kinase receptors, the c-mpl proto-oncogene encodes a new member of the cytokine receptor superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of c-mpl in a series of 105 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> using Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of c-mpl transcripts in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were not significantly different from those found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells, in which c-mpl was barely detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, c-mpl expression was increased in 26 of 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and in 5 of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the c-mpl gene was detected in genomic DNA of one M4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between c-mpl expression and the French-American-British classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with high c-mpl expression appeared to belong to a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a low rate of complete remission and a poor prognosis, including secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
