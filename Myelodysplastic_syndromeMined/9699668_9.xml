<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 that have greater potency may become adjuvant therapy for breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in remission and other cell types, especially in the setting of low disease burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new class of analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 has been synthesized that has a novel 19-nor motif, as well as incorporating many structural elements previously shown to increase potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analogs were examined for their effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> 145), a human breast cell line (MCF-7), and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-response clonogenic studies showed that each of these analogs had more potent antiproliferative activities against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells than 1,25(OH)2D3, and 1,25-(OH)2-16,23Z-diene-26,27-bishomo-19-nor-D3 (Ro 27-2014) was the most potent analog [10-fold increased activity compared to 1,25(OH)2D3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies were performed using Ro 27-2014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulse-exposure studies showed that a 5-day pulse-exposure to Ro 27-2014 (10(-7) M) in liquid culture was adequate to achieve a 50% inhibition of MCF-7 clonal growth in soft agar in the absence of the analog, suggesting that the growth inhibition mediated by the analog was irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analyses using MCF-7 cells showed that Ro 27-2014 (10(-7) M for 4 days) induced a significant increase in the number of cells in G0-G1 (72.8+/-8.9% versus 49.9+/-3.5% in control cells), with a concomitant decrease in the percent of cells in S phase (13.1+/-6.2% versus 35.8+/-3.5% in control cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The chief toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> compounds is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo>, and therefore, we examined calcemic activity of Ro 27-2014 in mice and found it not to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> at doses of 0.05 microg i.p. three times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the same dose of a 19-nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> compound with 6 fluorines on the side chain (1,25-(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-26,27-F6-19-nor-D3), although also having potent anticancer activity, caused severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> (18 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, 19-nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> compounds with desaturation and lengthening of their side chains result in a series of compounds with a good therapeutic index, having potent anticancer activity and low toxicity </plain></SENT>
