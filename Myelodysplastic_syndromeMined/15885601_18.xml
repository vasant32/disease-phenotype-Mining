<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to ascertain numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gaucher disease</z:e> since this is of considerable concern to patients and physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of 505 patients with type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gaucher disease</z:e> seen at a large referral clinic since 1990 were culled in December 2004 to ascertain diagnosis of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> identified during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-matched data from the Israeli National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (INCR) database were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before 1990 were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 500 patients, 227 (45.4%) were male, mean age=38.7 years; and 273 (54.6%) were female, mean age=37.0 years (SD=21.0 years for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (4.0%) had developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> through December 31, 2003: 6 were male and 14 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common were three cases each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rate among patients relative to age-matched rates reported in national Jewish Israeli and Ashkenazi Jewish Israeli registry records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no excess risk for hematological or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> among patients with type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gaucher disease</z:e> relative to the overall Jewish population matched for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms recent international studies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gaucher disease</z:e> for no excess risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> where these latter studies implicate a significantly higher incidence </plain></SENT>
