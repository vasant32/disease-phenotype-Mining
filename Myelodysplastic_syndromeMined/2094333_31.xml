<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Urinary iron excretion was greatest in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472759,C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia major</z:e> and was related to the number of previous transfusions but not to the serum ferritin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Substantial increases of urinary iron were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients when the frequency of the daily dose was doubled and in response to 2 x 3 g L1 daily 11 of 12 patients tested excreted greater than 25 mg iron daily, the mean daily intake of iron from transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels have fluctuated but overall have remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological studies in five patients have indicated rapid absorption probably from the stomach and variable plasma half life of 77 +/- 35 min (X +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glucuronation was identified as a major route of L1 metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Short-term intensive chelation studies using repeated administration of L1 resulted in further increases of urinary iron excretion by comparison to a single dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case 325 mg of iron were excreted in the urine following the administration of 16 g (5 x 2 g + 2 x 3 g) within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Iron excretion studies were carried out in six transfusional iron-loaded patients who were maintained on a low iron diet before and during chelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant increases of faecal iron excretion were observed with L1 using daily doses of up to 3 x 3 g and 4 x 2 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high level of compliance during treatment with L1 and the levels of urine iron excretion that can be achieved increase the prospects for oral chelation in transfusional iron-loaded patients </plain></SENT>
