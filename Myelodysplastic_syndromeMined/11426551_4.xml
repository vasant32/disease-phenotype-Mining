<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> (diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> made after a preexisting diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
