<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 76-year-old male, was consulted for mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in February 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 5 month, his hematological findings showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> getting worse rapidly and presence of blasts in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had slightly hypercellular marrow with marked trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased number of blasts (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis from the bone marrow cells revealed its various structural abnormalities, especially in No. 3, 4, 5, 7, 11 with translocation on 11q11, and large ring chromosomes derived from unknown one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By electron microscopic study, we observed bizarre structures, which was peculiar fibril formation as bundles of filament resembling actin paracrystals, throughout cytoplasm as well as within nucleus in granulocytes </plain></SENT>
