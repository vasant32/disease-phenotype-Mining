<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics studies from 40 patients were evaluated for early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prior to therapy, during therapy and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed patients with MM treated with LEN and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (LD) alone or followed by autologous stem cell transplant (LD/ASCT), or patients with relapsed/refractory MM treated with LEN, bendamustine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (BLD) were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline prevalence of mild morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was highest in pretreated patients with MM (BLD, 71%), but was also seen in newly diagnosed patients (LD and LD/ASCT, 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> did not increase over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study did not reveal rapidly emerging <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 39 of 40 patients with MM treated with LEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in one patient suggests that longer follow-up is needed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
