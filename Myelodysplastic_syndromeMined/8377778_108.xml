<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Recent studies have shown that long-term survivors of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be at high risk for malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was treated with immunosuppression or bone marrow transplantation and sought to identify risk factors according to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 860 patients treated by immunosuppression and 748 patients who had received bone marrow transplants for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was analyzed overall and according to treatment relative to the risk in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In calculating relative risk, we excluded patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> arising less than 6 months after treatment, and solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> arising less than 12 months after treatment, because of a possible association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> itself rather than with the treatment received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two malignant conditions were reported in the 860 patients who received immunosuppressive therapy: 19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 case of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 7 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine were reported in the 748 patients who received bone marrow transplants: two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the exclusions listed above, the overall relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 5.50 (P &lt; 0.001) as compared with that in the general European population; the risk was 5.15 (P &lt; 0.001) after immunosuppressive therapy and 6.67 (P &lt; 0.001) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 18.8 percent after immunosuppressive therapy and 3.1 percent after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> after immunosuppressive therapy included the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> to the immunosuppressive treatment (relative risk = 0.28), older age (relative risk = 1.03), treatment in 1982 or later, as compared with 1981 or earlier (relative risk = 3.01), splenectomy (relative risk = 3.65), and treatment with multiple courses of immunosuppression (relative risk = 2.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> after bone marrow transplantation were age (relative risk = 1.11 per year) and the use of radiation as a conditioning regimen before transplantation (relative risk = 9.56); such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> occurred only in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are at high risk for subsequent malignant conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> tend to follow immunosuppressive therapy, whereas the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> is similar after immunosuppression and after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
