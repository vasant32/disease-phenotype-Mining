<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> (L-AmB) compared with a combination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (F+I) as prophylaxis in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were undergoing initial induction chemotherapy were randomized to receive either F+I (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> 200 mg orally every 12 hours plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> tablets 200 mg orally every 12 hours) or L-AmB (3 mg/kg intravenously 3 times per week) in this prospective, open-label study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-two L-AmB-treated patients and 67 F+I-treated patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 47% of patients completed antifungal prophylaxis without a change in therapy for proven or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients in each arm developed a proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three percent of the L-AmB-treated patients and 24% of the F+I-treated patients were changed to alternative antifungal therapy because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (P value not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine percent of the L-AmB-treated patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology compared with 16% of the F+I-treated patients (P value not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels to &gt; 2 mg/dL (20% for the L-AmB arm vs. 6% for the F+I arm; P = 0.012) and increases in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels to &gt; 2 mg/dL (43% vs. 22%, respectively; P = 0.021) were more common with L-AmB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infusion-related reactions were noted in five L-AmB-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Responses to chemotherapy and induction mortality rates were similar for the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: L-AmB and F+I appear similar in their efficacy as antifungal prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>L-AmB was associated with higher rates of increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
