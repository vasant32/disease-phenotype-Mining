<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of allografting following conditioning with fludarabine, busulphan, and alemtuzumab in 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) (matched sibling donors [24] or volunteer unrelated donors [VUDs, 38]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age for sibling recipients was 56 years (range, 41-70 years) and for VUD recipients, 52 years (range, 22-65 years), with a median follow-up (survivors) of 524 days (range, 93-1392 days) and 420 days (range, 53-1495 days), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at days 100, 200, and 360 was 0%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, for siblings and 11%, 17%, and 21%, respectively, for VUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall survival at one year was 73% for siblings and 71% for VUDs, with a disease-free survival (DFS) of 61% and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of recipients, 86% achieved full-donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence at day 100 of grades III to IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) for VUD recipients was 9% and for sibling recipients, 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 26 patients (16 sibling and 10 VUD) who received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) at a median of 273 days (range, 126-1323 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RIC allogeneic HSCT using this protocol appears to be safe and permits durable donor engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is required to confirm any potential survival advantage </plain></SENT>
