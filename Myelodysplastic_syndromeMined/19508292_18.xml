<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 222 patients who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HCT in whom pretransplantation serum ferritin levels were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation ferritin &gt; 1910 microg/l was associated with lower overall survival (P = 0.003), lower relapse-free survival (P = 0.003), decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (P = 0.019) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when pretransplantation ferritin was analysed as a continuous variable and by quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that an elevated pretransplant ferritin level adversely impacts transplantation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adverse impact of elevated ferritin on NRM and survival was despite its association with lower incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, which are major causes of NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of ferritin with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and its influence on HCT outcomes requires further prospective validation </plain></SENT>
