<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several constitutive gene defects that contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0000363'>abnormal cell behavior</z:mp> have been identified in the hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of bone marrow stroma cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, however, has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the organization of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to see if it was impaired during the initiation and progression of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The buffy coat, hematon, and plasma fractions were separated from BM aspirates taken from healthy donors and diseased subjects at distinct clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structural integrity of the BM microenvironment was evaluated analyzing the morphogenetic unit, the hematon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hematon is a multicellular complex that includes fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, resident macrophages, hematopoietic cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC), high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU), burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and terminally differentiated cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematon complexes were present in most BM aspirates from healthy donors (46H+/55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But they were absent from most of the patients with MDP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29233">21H+</z:chebi>/62) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (5H+/24) in the first perceptible phase, and from those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> throughout the disease (5H+/55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematon complexes were present in the BM aspirate in 22/36 AML patients at clinical remission after chemotherapy or differentiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hematon fraction isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM, contained 25 times more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25-hydroxyvitamin D3</z:chebi> and about 500-fold more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3</z:chebi> than the BM plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3</z:chebi> was low or undetectable in the BM plasma of some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, patients with MDP (18/35) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (9/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the BM microenvironment, the metabolism of low-density <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and lipophylic hormones are severely impaired prior to initiation or during the accelerated expansion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lack of organized stromal network and the decreased level of some lipophylic hormones, acting probably as morphogens, may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
