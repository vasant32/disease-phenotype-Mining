<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for this complication based on a single-center experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 255 consecutive patients, aged 29 (10-56) years, who survived without disease progression after alloHCT performed between 1992-2003 were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen was myeloablative, donors were either related (n=177) or unrelated volunteers (URD-HCT) (n=78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of the overall and extensive cGVHD equaled 48% and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis the following factors were associated with increased risk of cGVHD: preceding grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, recipient age &gt; or =40 years, URD-HCT, the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and CD3 cell dose 50 x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar factors, excluding recipient age contributed to increased risk of extensive cGVHD, however, the cut-point for CD3 cell dose was 100 x l0(6)/kg and the use of steroids for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD prophylaxis was found an additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> subgroup the risk of cGVHD was increased for patients previously treated with interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Various recipient-, donor-, and procedure-related factors are related to the risk of cGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individualized treatment and modification of risk factors may contribute to improved outcome </plain></SENT>
