<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FLT3/ITD mutations have also been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients both before and during progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that insertion of an FLT3/ITD mutation into the murine Flt3 gene induces a myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, but not progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, suggesting that additional cooperating events are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore combined the FLT3/ITD mutation with a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> involving transgenic expression of the Nup98-HoxD13 (NHD13) fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice expressing both the FLT3/ITD and NHD13 transgene developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with 100% penetrance and short latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were driven by mutant FLT3 expression and were susceptible to treatment with FLT3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed a spontaneous loss of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Flt3 allele in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, further modeling the loss of the heterozygosity phenomenon that is seen in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with FLT3-activating mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remains an important clinical issue, this model may help identify new molecular targets in collaborative signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
