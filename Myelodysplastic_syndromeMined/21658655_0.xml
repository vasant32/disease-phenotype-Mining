<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A newly proposed cytogenetic risk classification (NPCRC) has defined four risk groups including favorable, intermediate-1 (Int-1), intermediate-2 (Int-2) and unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluated the prognostic power of the NPCRC in patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2007, 116 MDS patients receiving best supportive care were included in the analysis at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the NPCRC, 3 patients had 5q-,1 patient had 12p-, 3 patients had 20q-, 3 patients had -Y, patient had t(11)(q23), 55 patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1 patient had +1q, 1 patient had 3q21/q26-abnormalities, 11 patients had +8, 14 patients had any other single, 8 patients had any other double, 2 patients had -7/7q-, 5 patients had three complex abnormalities, and 8 patients had more than three complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, 66 patients (57%) were favorable, 35 (30%) were Int-1, 9 (8%) were Int-2, and 6 (5%) were in the unfavorable subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median OS times were 23.8, 24.1, 13.0, and 9.1 months in the favorable, Int-1, Int-2 and unfavorable subgroups, respectively (P = .005, between favorable/Int-1 and Int-2/unfavorable risk group, hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.25-3.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, the NPCRC seems to stratify patients according to their risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, especially between the unfavorable/Int-2 and Int-1/favorable risk groups </plain></SENT>
