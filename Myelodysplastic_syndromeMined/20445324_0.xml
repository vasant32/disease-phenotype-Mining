<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the diagnostic utility of immunophenotyping for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), it has not been widely performed, and reports on this are absent in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the immunophenotypic features of non-blastic granulocytes, monocytes, and blasts in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and non-clonal disorders using routine flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we evaluated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> of mature cells in leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Marrow aspirates from 60 patients, including 18 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 24 with non-clonal disorders (control group), were analyzed using FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blasts, non-blast myeloid cells, and monocytes were gated based on CD45 expression and side scatter (SSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes were then compared among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to non-clonal disorders, the granulocytic lineages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed decreased SSC (P=0.005), increased CD45 intensity (P=0.020), decreased CD10-positive granulocytes (P= 0.030), and a higher CD56-positive rate (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that similar results were obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group, and these findings were not related to the phenotypes of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using blast and monocytic gating, useful parameters for generating a differential diagnosis were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gating the granulocytic region is a relatively easy method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the parameters studied, SSC, CD10, and CD56 were the most useful for differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-clonal disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While immunophenotypic changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> appear to be useful for differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-clonal disorders, these changes were also noted in the mature cells of leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
