<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A greater than 3-fold increase in neutrophil count was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients after rhG-CSF infusions, whereas the number of blasts in the bone marrow did not increase and none of them progressed into the leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After rhG-CSF treatment, the bone marrow cells obtained from patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> did not show any particular chromosome abnormalities such as chromosomal breakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, two of the four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with acquired chromosome abnormalities showed a change in the frequency of marrow cells with clonal abnormalities after rhG-CSF treatment; the proportion of metaphase cells with additional numerical chromosome abnormalities decreased in these two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of the treatment, the constitution of marrow cells with chromosome changes reverted to that before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients did not show any particular chromosome changes after the rhG-CSF treatment, indicating that rhG-CSF may not promote the characteristics of dyshematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and act on cells derived from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
