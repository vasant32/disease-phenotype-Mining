<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromosome specimens were prepared by short-term culture of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was made by R banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome painting was performed using whole chromosome probes 1 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conventional karyotype analysis revealed t(1;18)(p31;p11) in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome painting analysis confirmed this result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The translocation of (1;18) was an unusual recurrent chromosome change and was reported on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for the first time </plain></SENT>
