<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the outcome of 211 consecutive unrelated donor (URD) bone marrow transplants (BMT) performed at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN) between May 1985 and December 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety patients (43%) received marrow matched serologically at HLA A, B, and DR loci; 86 (41%) received marrow with a major and 32 (15%) marrow with a minor serologic mismatch at the HLA A or B locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that older age had an adverse effect on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In younger (age less than 18 years) recipients, survival after fully matched (A, B, and DR sub-type) or major mismatched (A or B locus), DR subtype-matched donor BMT was not significantly different (P = .4; survival: 53% v 41%, respectively, at 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For adults, survival after matched donor BMT was significantly better than that with mismatched donors (P &lt; .01; survival: 30% v 10%, respectively, at 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formal quality of life assessment by telephone interview demonstrated similar functional status in survivors of URD and related donor (RD) BMT at least 2 years post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>URD BMT provides effective therapy for a variety of lethal hematopoietic diseases that rivals outcome of RD transplant in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of URD marrow with a major mismatch at one HLA A or B locus is well tolerated in young, but not in older, recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations should be used to improve donor selection and counseling for URD BMT candidates </plain></SENT>
