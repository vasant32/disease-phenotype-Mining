<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were classified as low or intermediate 1 according to the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, 44 (71%) patients had an erythroid response (34 major and 10 minor), including eight of 13 patients who were previous non-responders to conventional EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two additional responses (one minor and one major) occurred, in 10 non-responders, after the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six of the 46 total responders (31/35 major and 5/11 minor) continued to respond on maintenance <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> after a median of 40 weeks (range 4-84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> required to maintain response was 300 microg every 14 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only prognostic factors of favourable response were low endogenous EPO level and low or absent red blood cell transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those results suggest that high-dose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> alone yields high erythroid response rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, possibly equivalent to those obtained with conventional EPO + G-CSF, although this will need to be confirmed in larger and randomised trials </plain></SENT>
