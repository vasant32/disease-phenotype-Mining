<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this way we have distinguished aggregates according to their size, in clusters or colonies and grouped them according to their "in vitro" appearance time, transformation from cluster to colony, "in vitro" survival time and "in vitro" degeneration time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This statement of the study allow us to map CFU-GM subtypes in a percentage distribution related to the total growth of CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between absolute number of growth of different CFU-GM subtypes in DS vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> subjects show both significant and not significant differences, while comparisons between percentages of growth in DS vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> subjects did not show significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this work we suggest an outline for the study and the interpretation of CFU-GM growth patterns in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> at risk of evolution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
