<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated treosulfan, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, with the aim of developing an efficient and reliable but less-toxic conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of 30 patients who were not eligible for standard conditioning therapy received transplants from HLA-matched related (n = 14) or unrelated (n = 16) donors after administration of treosulfan 10 g/m2 intravenously daily for 3 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving grafts from unrelated donors also were given rabbit antithymocyte globulin 10 mg/kg intravenously daily for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved prompt neutrophil and platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extramedullary toxicity was generally mild with Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4 attributable to the conditioning seen only with transaminases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete donor chimerism was achieved by 90% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) grade III or IV developed in 14% of the patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An estimated overall survival rate of 73% and an event-free survival rate of 49% have been reached after a median of 22 months (range, 7.4-33.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the combination of treosulfan and fludarabine is a safe and efficient conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
