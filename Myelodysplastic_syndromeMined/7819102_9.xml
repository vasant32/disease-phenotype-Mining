<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had clonal chromosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> or translocations at diagnosis, and were treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), chemotherapy (CT) or interferon-alpha therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metaphase-FISH was performed during therapy-induced complete haematological remission (CR) (BMT and CT patients) using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labelled whole chromosome paint probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>28% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in CR were shown by FISH to have abnormal metaphase cells, and 62% of this group suffered a clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those with negative FISH results (72%), 12% relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients treated with BMT a small population of t(9;22)-positive cells was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells disappeared during follow-up without causing a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One ALL patient had abnormal cells a short time after start of therapy but was also later found FISH-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that metaphase-FISH is a suitable method for quantifying the proportion of abnormal cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients during interferon-alpha therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Metaphase-FISH was also employed to detect a local relapse in an ALL patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, metaphase-FISH was found reliable and sensitive for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in patients with haemopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
