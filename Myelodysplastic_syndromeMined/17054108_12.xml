<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty patients were randomized to receive high-dose fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (FEC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) (fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2) on Days 1 to 4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi> 35 mg/m(2) on Days 2 to 4, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 400 mg/m(2) on Days 2 to 4 for 4 cycles every 21 days) with or without lenograstim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Locoregional treatment consisted of surgery and/or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi> 75 mg/m(2), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No hormone treatment was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The safety of the FEC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> regimen was described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 102 patients who underwent surgery, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved by 23.5% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumors</z:e> and by 31.4% of patients with involved axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall pCR rate was 14.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred nine patients received FEC 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median 10 years of follow-up, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 35.7% and 41.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median DFS was 39 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 25-53 months), and the median survival was 61 months (95% CI, 43-79 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed a temporary decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the lenograstim group, 1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> M2, and 1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FEC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> induction chemotherapy followed by FEC 75 maintenance regimen had moderate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> long-term toxicities and lead to high DFS and OS rates in patients with IBC </plain></SENT>
