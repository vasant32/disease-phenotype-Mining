<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 51-year-old patient with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), who underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) after conditioning with a novel regimen consisting of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The second PBSCT was performed early, at 3 months after the initial allogeneic BMT, but it was well tolerated and complete hematologic remission was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient did not experience any early transplantation-related organ toxicity but died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> 6 months after the second transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that this novel regimen may induce remission and could be offered to patients relapsing after the first transplantation; however, the fludarabine-containing regimen might be accompanied by profound immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
