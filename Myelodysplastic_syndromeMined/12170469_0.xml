<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow chromosome preparation of five cases was made using direct method or short- term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis was carried out by R-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) using Spectrum Red and Spectrum Green directly labeled chromosome 1-specific a-satellite DNA probe(red) and chromosome 7-specific a-satellite DNA probe(green) was performed in three patients of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the five cases had 1;7 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The centromere of the derivative chromosome 7p/1q was constituted with red and green signals in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The result of dual-color FISH confirms that the centromere of the derivative chromosome resulting from 1;7 translocation originated from both centromeres of chromosome 1 and chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
