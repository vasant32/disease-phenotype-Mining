<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 227 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (1) to identify the prognostic factors of survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolution in Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, (2) to apply different prognostic scoring systems to the same group of patients, and (3) to compare the FAB with the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six scoring systems were applied to the patients, and the FAB and WHO classifications were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' median age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 21 months, and age, dysgranulopoiesis and the IPSS cytogenetic groups were independent prognostic factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>Acute leukemia</z:hpo> occurred in 34 patients, and the cumulative incidence was 27.1% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow blast percentage was the only independent prognostic factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most scoring systems successfully discriminated risk groups for survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolution, but patient distribution into risk groups varied according to the scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB II</z:e> seemed to have different prognoses from RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB I</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had different disease natures from those of Western countries regarding clinical features, prognostic factors and cytogenetic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the WHO classification seems to improve the FAB classification, further studies are warranted to validate the utility of the WHO classification before it is accepted for routine clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study has the limitations of retrospective analysis, and our results should be verified in future prospective studies </plain></SENT>
