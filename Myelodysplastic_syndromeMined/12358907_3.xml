<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two intermediate groups were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IPSS was of limited value in predicting survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients after preliminary separation into subgroups with &lt; 5%, or &gt;/= 5%, myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox's proportional hazards analysis of these subgroups enabled discrimination of highly significant prognostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both subgroups, longer survival was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and marrow myeloblast number were used to define four groups with prognostic significance similar to the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A low-risk group was described by <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> associated with &lt; 5% myeloblasts and high risk was related to blast counts &gt;/= 5% and MCV &lt; 100 fl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis defined factors identifying very high-risk patients and those with benign disease, together with many intermediate survival patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were consistent in two time-separated patient groups </plain></SENT>
