<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested genomic instability in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by the comet assay and verified the suitability of this approach as a tool for analysis of ineffective hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythroid and myeloid cell populations from bone marrow aspirates of 20 RA, 14 RARS and 15 control subjects were separated by differential expression of glycophorin A and subjected to comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of DNA migration was measured in single cells (200 cells/bone marrow fraction/subject) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were in agreement with the concept of <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RA samples had a significantly higher DNA instability than controls in glycophorin A positive cells, and the extent of DNA breakage correlated with the degree of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> had an even higher rate of genomic instability in bone marrow cells than RA, there was no clear relationship to peripheral cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests an additional DNA instability of non-apoptotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether this increase is associated with an increased repair of oxidative damage in DNA arising due to iron deposits in ring sideroblasts remains to be formally proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comet assay provides a promising tool for the investigation of difference between RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> pathobiology </plain></SENT>
