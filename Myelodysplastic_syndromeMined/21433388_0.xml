<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphate (HePTP) is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells with specificity for the dephosphorylation of Erk and p38 MAP kinases (MAPKs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been found that HePTP is often dysregulated in the preleukemic disorder <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogeneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identified probe ML119 (CID-1357397) selectively inhibits HePTP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since this probe scaffold was discovered through its activity in the HePTP assays with small molecule substrates, it is proposed that this inhibition occurs through direct targeting of the HePTP active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probe inhibits through fast equilibrium as judged by the lack of apparent effect when pre-incubated with phosphatase proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, small molecule inhibitors of HePTP would be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, these probes may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, where HePTP has been reported to be overexpressed </plain></SENT>
