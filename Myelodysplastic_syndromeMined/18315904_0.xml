<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>8 patients with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with CAHB by continuous intravenous infusion for 10 days, and repeated once after an interval of 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The count of the granulo- and mono-blasts in bone marrow (BM) aspirate was measured before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of CAHB for 72 hours in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of CAHB on proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells in vitro was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was detected by the changes of CD11b and CD14 expression on cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was detected by double staining of Annexin V and PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle distribution change of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was analyzed by flow-cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the granulo- and mono-blasts in BM decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 8 patients after CAHB treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main side effect of CAHB on hematological system was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After being treated with 1, 2, 3, 4 mmol/L CAHB for 72 hours in vitro, the result of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay showed the inhibitory effect of CAHB on the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells in dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After being treated manner 1, 2, 3, 4 mmol/L CAHB for 72 hours, the CD11b positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells were 22.39+/-3.97%, 33.12+/-4.46%, 49.25+/-5.27%, 78.05+/-5.66%, respectively, which were significantly different from the control group (CD11b positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was 5.89+/-2.94%) (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CD14 expression was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that CAHB could induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells to differentiate into mature granulocytes, and the effect of CAHB appeared in dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After being treated for 72 hours by 1, 2, 3, 4 mmol/L CAHB, the apoptotic cells (Annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells) increased mildly, which suggested that CAHB only weakly induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at the concentration of 1 to 4 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Along with the concentration increase of CAHB, the ratio of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase increased, and ratio of cells in S phase and G(2)/M phase decreased correspondingly, it indicated that CAHB could arrest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells in G(0)/G(1) phase in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that induction of cell differentiation may be the primary effect of CAHB on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle arrest may be essential to the effect of CAHB as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Side effect of CAHB on platelet count may correlated with its inhibitory effect on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
