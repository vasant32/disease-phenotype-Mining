<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected according to the new diagnostic criteria for PMDS of the FAB-cooperation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Impairments of granulocyte functions were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several steps in the mobilization of granulocytes at the site of injury seemed to be affected: decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (P less than 0.05), deficient chemotaxis (P less than 0.05), decreased enzyme content (P less than 0.001), 'slower' chemiluminescence (P less than 0.005), decreased phagocytosis (P less than 0.05) and impaired microbicidal capacity (P less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between disease category and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002462'>granulocyte dysfunction</z:mp> was discerned, though an increasing number of blasts was associated with more severe granulocytic disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results in seven patients with abnormal karyotypes were not significantly different from 13 others with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that defects in blood neutrophil function are a common feature in PMDS and might account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>increased frequency of infection</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
