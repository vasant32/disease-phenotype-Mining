<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inactivating mutations of the catalytic component of PRC2, EZH2, are seen in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that the other 2 core PRC2 components, SUZ12 and EED, may also be mutational targets in these diseases, as well as associated factors such as JARID2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUZ12 mutations were identified in 1 of 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with 17q acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and in 2 of 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> cases with focal 17q11 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 were missense mutations affecting the highly conserved VEFS domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a further 146 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> patients revealed an additional VEFS domain mutant, yielding a total mutation frequency of 1.4% (2 of 148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not find mutations of JARID2 or EED in association with acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for chromosome 6p or 11q, respectively; however, screening unselected cases identified missense mutations in EED (1 of 148; 1%) and JARID2 (3 of 148; 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 SUZ12 mutations tested and the EED mutation reduced PRC2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferase activity in vitro, demonstrating that PRC2 function may be compromised in myeloid disorders by mutation of distinct genes </plain></SENT>
