<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), platelets, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), as well as on transfusion frequency, was examined in 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (11 RA, four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 61 years (range 44-81), and the male/female ratio was 14/11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of ATRA at 25 mg/m2/day p.o. for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, IFN-alpha at 1.5 MIU twice a week s.c. for 52 weeks, and, in patients with initial ANC &lt;500/microl, G-CSF at 100-480 microg daily s.c. according to the degree of ANC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of therapy was scheduled for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients achieved ongoing CR (+19 months; +16 months), one patient with RA after 3 months and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> after 7 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the mean ANC increased significantly from 1400+/-200/microl before the start of therapy to 3500+/-600/microl at the end of treatment (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients an increase of Hb was observed, and one patient ceased to require transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In an additional patient with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, the platelet count normalized following administration of ATRA/IFN-alpha, increasing from 89,000/microl to 293,000/microl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients were nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that therapy with ATRA, IFNalpha, and G-CSF is effective in approximately 35% of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (in this study: six of 17) and may induce complete remission in individual cases </plain></SENT>
