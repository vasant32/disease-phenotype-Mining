<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down Syndrome</z:e> (DS) have a 20-40 fold increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), mainly of the megakaryoblastic subtype (AMKL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10 % of newborns with DS show transient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> (TMD) which normally resolves spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blast cells of both entities show megakaryoblastic/erythroblastic features (M7/M6) and cannot be distinguished by morphological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Blast cells of 62 children were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry and dual color fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunophenotype of blast cells from children with TMD and DS-AMKL is characterized by the expression of CD33 (+)/CD13 (+/-)/CD38 (+)/CD117 (+)/CD34 (+/-)/CD7 (+)/CD56 (+/-)/CD36 (+)/CD71 (+)/CD42b (+)/CD4dim (+)/TPO-R (+)/EPO-R (-)/IL-3-Ralpha (+)/IL-6-Ralpha (-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-DS children with morphologically related diseases, i. e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML-M6</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M7, did not show this expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34 expression was observed in 93 % of TMD, but only 50 % of DS-AMKL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blast cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TMD and DS-AMKL cases were positive for TPO-R and IL-3R, whereas EPO-R and IL-6R were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping by the use of surface antigens and growth factor receptors is a useful tool to discriminate TMD and DS-AMKL from diseases with morphologically similar or identical blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of EPO-R on the blast cells might be a sign of the high expression of the mutated -- and less active -- GATA1 in DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher amount of CD34 co-expression in TMD may be interpreted to indicate that TMD is a slightly more immature disease than DS-AMKL </plain></SENT>
