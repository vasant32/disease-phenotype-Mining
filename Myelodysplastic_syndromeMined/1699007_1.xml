<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rhG-CSF was administered daily by intravenous infusion over 30 min. to 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="28618">PARA</z:chebi> = 11, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> = 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in T = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose was escalated stepwise from 50 to 400 microgram/m2 every week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within one week to 26 days after commencement of rhG-CSF administration, the increases of absolute neutrophil counts in peripheral blood were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rhG-CSF enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow myeloid cell differentiation and maturation in 3 of 9 PARA patients and in 3 of 4 RAEB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of patients changed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> attributable to rhG-CSF, but one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patient and two of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in T patients progressed to leukemic phase in 21 days or two months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor side effects or abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 3 patients (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that treatment with rhG-CSF was well tolerated and effective for improving the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> between 50 to 400 micrograms/m2 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
