<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique involves a selective amplification of genomic DNA sequences containing the codon sequence of interest, in combination with oligonucleotide hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examining fractionated mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood, an N-ras mutation at position 13 was observed in one patient with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, resulting in a base change from GGT to TGT thus converting glycine to cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other cases exhibited no ras gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is surprising that c-ras mutations are only occasionally observed in overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> related to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, as such abnormalities have often been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> de novo, and as many <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> are known to produce DNA adducts leading to point mutations and substitution of single amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fact that deletions of varying parts of the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 7 are observed in most cases of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>, as confirmed by our own series of 71 patients, suggests that loss of heterozygosity for specific alleles on the two chromosomes, rather than activation of a protooncogene, could be an important step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
