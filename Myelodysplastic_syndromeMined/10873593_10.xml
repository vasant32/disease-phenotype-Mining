<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the molecular consequences of such aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore established a PAC contig in the 3q21 breakpoint region and identified potential protein coding sequences by exon trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the exons isolated was from the human GATA-2 gene, which we showed to be transcribed from telomere to centromere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of 3q21 breakpoints are located telomeric to the transcribed portion of this gene in a region that in mice appears to be necessary for proper promoter function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of GATA-2 expression analyses in leukemic cell lines as well as primary patient samples are compatible with the hypothesis that 3q21 aberrations contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> through deregulation of the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-2 </plain></SENT>
