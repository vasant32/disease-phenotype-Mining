<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because patients with -7 have a poor prognosis, their identification is important for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventionally, -7 is detected by the G-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology to detect -7 cells in interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients whose leukemic cells were found to have -7 by G-banding at disease presentation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 of these patients, -7 could be detected in interphase by FISH using a chromosome 7-specific centromeric DNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two patients whose leukemic cells were not detectable by interphase FISH had -7 and t(1q;7p), which were detectable by FISH in metaphase using a chromosome 7-specific painting probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metaphase FISH was particularly useful in further defining chromosome 7 defects in cells that contained aberrant or marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, in 6 patients, chromosome 7 sequences were detectable in aberrant or marker chromosomes by metaphase FISH, but not by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that metaphase FISH is an important adjunct to conventional cytogenetic methods for defining chromosome 7 abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, interphase FISH is useful for follow-up studies in patients who are found informative for the FISH study at presentation </plain></SENT>
