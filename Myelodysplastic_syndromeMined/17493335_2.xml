<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 2-ME inhibited the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner and caused a sustained arrest at G(2)/M phase in MUTZ-1 cells; the typical apoptotic morphological features appeared in MUTZ-1 cells; the production of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase was up-regulated and the marked DNA ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the mechanism of proliferation inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUTZ-1 cells induced by 2-ME is probably related with the G(2)/M cell cycle arrest; 2-ME may be a potentially adjunctive anticancer drug useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
