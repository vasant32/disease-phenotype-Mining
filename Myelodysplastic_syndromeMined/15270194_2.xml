<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence, etiologies, radiographic patterns, and clinical outcomes of adult leukemics with prolonged febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medical records of adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosed between January 1989 and June 2000 and undergoing induction chemotherapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the patients who presented with a pulmonary infiltrate, secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (e.g., transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, or disease following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> therapy) were included and those developing infiltrates following consolidation chemotherapy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were excluded; 93 patients received induction chemotherapy and were included in the study analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 36 years (15 - 70 years); 58 males and 35 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty two percent patients received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">Cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">Arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), 17% received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi>, 11% received Ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, and 6% received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic Acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> were 5 and 15 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>Pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> were identified during 45% of neutropenic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A presumptive causative organism was isolated from 50% of patients with an infiltrate: <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>Gram-positive</z:mp> bacteria were most common (47%) followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> bacilli (33%) and fungi (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival data were available for 88 patients; median disease free survival for the entire cohort was 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Male sex (p=0.015), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (p=0.02) and bilateral distribution of an infiltrate (p=0.03) were statistically significant predictors of early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, the median disease-free interval and overall survival were 2.5 and 4.6 months and 9 and 13 months (p=0.038 and p=0.095) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred at a mean of 5.0 after initiation of induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and bilateral distribution of an infiltrate were found to be statistically significant predictors of early mortality </plain></SENT>
