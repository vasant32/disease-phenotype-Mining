<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This early stem cell is believed to acquire a growth advantage over its neighbors as a result of an initial transforming event, the nature of which has remained obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose that pathogens such as those belonging to the herpesvirus family of DNA viruses may play a role in the initial transformation of the stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case for cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a representative of this family of viruses is discussed at length and a molecular mechanism which may be involved in the oncogenic activity of CMV is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No proof has been presented to implicate CMV directly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but circumstantial evidence which supports such a possibility is provided </plain></SENT>
