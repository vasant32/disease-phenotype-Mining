<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In alloimmunized patients, effects of platelet transfusion were correlated with the HLA-matching grade; 100% effective in A-match, 92% in B-match and 65% in C-match </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This correlation was not observed if the patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfusion of A- or B-matched platelets resulted in a lowering or disappearance of HLA antibody activities in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the transfusion of C-matched platelets caused increasing or appearance of HLA antibody activities in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO-incompatibility</z:e> did not show a significant effect on platelet transfusion when anti-A or anti-B antibody activities in donors and antiglobulin tests on patients' red cells were negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non HLA, platelet specific antibodies were produced in some patients and presumed to be participated in the destruction of transfused HLA-matched platelets </plain></SENT>
