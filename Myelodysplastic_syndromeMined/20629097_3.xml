<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> Francophone de cytogenetique hematologique (GFCH) has collected and reviewed 82 patients with transformation of MPN (66 AML/MDS and 16 MF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JAK2V617F and TET2 mutations were searched for in 40 and 32 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly more -7/del(7q) (P = 0.004) and -5/del(5q) (P = 0.03) were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> with a higher incidence of dup1q (P = 0.01) in MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some specific chromosomal abnormalities occurred together, for example -5/del(5q) and -17/del(17p) (P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with an inferior overall survival (OS); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> transformation (P &lt; 0.0001) and -5/del(5q) abnormality (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although both giving rise to loss of 7q, der(1;7) differed from other 7q deletions in terms of distribution (lower frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, P = 0.02), association with chromosomal abnormalities (absence of -5/del(5q), P = 0.003; increased del(20q), P = 0.05), and longer OS (P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected 24/40 (60%) JAK2V617F and 8/25 (32%) TET2 mutations in samples following transformation, ranging from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> to mutated forms of both genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> forms of the genes were not found to be associated with a specific chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that JAK2 or TET2 mutations were associated with the type of MPN transformation, whereas the type of cytogenetic abnormalities were strongly linked, perhaps indicating that they play a specific role in the transformation process </plain></SENT>
