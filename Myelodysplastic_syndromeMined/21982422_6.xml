<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The importance of matching at the HLA C locus has not been well defined for unrelated umbilical-cord blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The selection algorithm for umbilical-cord blood units generally considers intermediate resolution HLA typing at A and B and allele-level typing at DRB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to establish the relative importance of additional matching at HLA C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used Cox regression to assess retrospectively the effect of donor-recipient HLA matching on outcomes of single umbilical-cord blood transplantations for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our primary endpoint was transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA typing was done with molecular techniques with a minimum of intermediate resolution for HLA A, B, and C, and at the allele-level for DRB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The median age of our study population was 10 years (range &lt;1-62) and 552 (69%) of 803 patients were aged 16 years or younger at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with transplantations matched at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 (n=69), transplant-related mortality risk was higher after transplantations matched at HLA A, B, and DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=23; HR 3·97, 95% CI 1·27-12·40; p=0·018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality risk was also higher after transplantations with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=234; 1·70, 1·06-2·74; p=0·029) compared with transplantations matched at HLA C with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 (n=127) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessing the overall effect of HLA disparity on transplant-related mortality, risks were higher with units mismatched at two (n=259; 3·27, 1·42-7·54; p=0·006), three (n=253; 3·34, 1·45-7·71; p=0·005), or four (n=75; 3·51, 1·44-8·58; p=0·006) loci compared with matched units (n=69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the present strategy for umbilical-cord blood unit selection should be reassessed; matching at HLA C for units that are matched at HLA A, B, or DRB1 or in the presence of a single locus mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 should be included to minimise mortality risks </plain></SENT>
