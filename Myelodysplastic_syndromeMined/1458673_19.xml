<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with myeloproliferative or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, treated with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha) for a minimum of 1 up to 4 years, were examined for the occurrence of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During treatment, the rate of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> rose to more than 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decrease in severity and frequency of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> after withdrawal of IFN shows that this is a potentially reversible side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The key determinant for the manifestation of this IFN-related autoimmune phenomenon seems to be a predisposition for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, since patients with initially detectable thyroid antibodies are prone to exacerbations of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrent with thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> occurred but did not correlate with the levels of thyroid antibodies, although severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in two patients was accompanied by increased levels of thyroid antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This investigation shows that thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and consecutively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> must be expected in certain patients treated with rIFN-alpha during long periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it may be assumed that IFN-alpha does not induce the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, but rather enhances the levels of pre-existent thyroid antibodies </plain></SENT>
