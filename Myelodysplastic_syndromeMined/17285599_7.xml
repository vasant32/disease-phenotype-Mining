<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>c-Kit is expressed in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas clinical trials evaluating monotherapy with IM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> revealed low response rates, Ara-C and IM showed synergistic effects in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggested evaluation of a combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) combined with IM was tested to determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty patients from 4 centers with c-Kit-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 34) and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (HR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 6) with a median age of 73 years were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were either not eligible for myelosuppressive therapy and/or had recurring/refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 38 patients a blast response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight of 38 patients showed stable disease for more than 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The objective hematologic response rate was low (11%), with 2 patients showing hematologic improvement and 1 each with a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 138 days, with 20% of patients alive after an observation period of 600 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Study medication was applied in an ambulatory setting with minimal hospitalization time, an early mortality rate of only 18.9%, and a low toxicity rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LDAC plus IM does not appear to be inferior in older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients incomparison with historic controls receiving myelosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, this trial also shows that LDAC/IM does not appear to be more effective than LDAC monotherapy in a patient population not selected for appropriate molecular markers </plain></SENT>
