<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 156 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) or very severe AA treated with ISA (antithymocyte globulin [ATG] or ATG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>), 46.8% showed complete or partial response and 7.1% had relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After long-term follow-up, 1 case each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6-year survival rate was 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to ISA, disease severity, and low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (&lt; or = 200/mm3) were associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient age, sex, initial platelet count, etiology, or treatment regimen did not significantly affect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed low ANC to be the only pretreatment variable significantly associated with poor survival (P = .000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 64 BMT recipients, 82.8% had sustained engraftment, and 12.5% experienced graft failure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 6-year survival rate was 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patient age and sex, disease severity, etiology, ANC, initial platelet count, and treatment regimen did not affect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival of 83 AA patients, aged 14 to 40 years, treated with ISA was not statistically significant from that of 61 adult AA patients who underwent BMT (6-year survival rate, 65% and 79%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, BMT in adult AA achieved long-term engraftment and a lower relapse rate than ISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ISA can achieve a high response rate and long-term survival among patients with adult AA, regardless of disease severity </plain></SENT>
