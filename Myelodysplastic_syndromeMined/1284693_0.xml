<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>19 patients with bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> received 112 platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of platelet transfusions was determined by corrected count increment (CCI) and resonance thrombography in correlation to the clinical situation of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and chemotherapy did not impair the values 1 h after transfusion, but the 24-hour CCI showed a reduced survival of the transfused platelets in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CCI was 11.3 1 h after transfusion and 9.5 1 day after transfusion in the patient group without any factor reducing the efficiency of transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group, the resonance thrombography significantly improved 1 and 24 h posttransfusion compared to pretransfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate an acceptable clinical efficiency of platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
