<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, examination of peripheral blood from 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed that the majority had low lymphocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a detailed study of 25 patients, using OKT3, OKT4 and OKT8 monoclonal antisera together with SRBC rosettes, it was shown that there is a consistent and significant reduction in peripheral blood T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This decrease was primarily confined to the OKT4-defined helper subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a consequent relative increase in the OKT8-defined subset but in absolute numbers however, suppressor cells are reduced compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> particularly in those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlations between <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cell abnormalities</z:mp> and the different morphological groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible implications of the reversed helper/suppressor ratio in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
