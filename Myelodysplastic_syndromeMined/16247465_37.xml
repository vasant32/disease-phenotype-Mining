<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AML1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, suggesting that genetic alterations of the gene contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the analysis of mice carrying conditional AML1 knockout alleles that were inactivated using the Cre/loxP system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AML1 was deleted in adult mice by inducing Cre activity to replicate AML1 deletions found in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorder</z:e> and rare de novo human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a latency of 2 months after induction, the thymus was reduced in size and frequently populated by immature double negative thymocytes, indicating defective T-lymphocyte maturation, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024228" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphatic diseases</z:e> with 50% penetrance, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath> and thymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to the liver and the meninges were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice also developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> with an expansion of the myeloid compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased Howell-Jolly body counts indicated splenic hypofunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred due to immaturity of mini-megakaryocytes in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> in the peripheral blood and increased fractions of immature cells in the bone marrow, AML1 deficient mice display features of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, suggesting a preleukemic state </plain></SENT>
