<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is still, however, unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following the hypothesis of the lesion of the pluripotential cell, we have studied the composition of red cell membrane in 5 patients afflicted with MS (1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>; 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> plus excessive blast count and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The red cells of the patients afflicted with MS has morphological alterations at examination in fresh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001927'>acanthocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structurally, they showed an increase in the cholesterol/phospolipids (C/P) quotient, which was responsible for the increase of the cell area and <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the high level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> (SP) and its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of phosphatidil-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> (PEA), justify the double population of red cells; one of which being acantocytes and the other has and aquired mutation of the genetic code, which confirms the chromosomic alterations widely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We feel that our findings confirmed the hypothesis of the effects of an oncogen on the genoma of the mother cell, which can be causal of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and other genetically confirmed alterations </plain></SENT>
