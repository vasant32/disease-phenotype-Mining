<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 36 sMDS patients, 13 (36%) had only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes whereas 23 (64%) displayed clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common aberrations were -7, 5q-, -5, and +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (43% of the cytogenetically aberrant cases), clones with only one anomaly, mostly 5q- or -7, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 40 sANLL patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes were detected in 10 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 30 (75%) abnormal cases, the most frequent aberrations were -7, -5, +8, 7q-, -17, and +21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 patients (40%) had clones with single abnormalities, most often -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 sANLL patients cytogenetically unrelated clones were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously published secondary hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> reveals that the most frequent abnormalities in sMDS are -7 (41%), 5q- (28%), and -5 (11%), followed by der(21q), +8, 7q-, der(12p), t(1;7), -12, -17, der(17p), der(3p), der(6p), and -18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clones with single aberrations have been found in 45% of the cases and cytogenetically unrelated clones have been described in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities in sANLL are -7 (38%), 5q- (17%), -5 (15%), +8 (13%), and -17 (11%), followed by der(3q), der(11q), der(12p), -21, 7q-, -18, der(3p), der(17p), +21, der(21q), der(6p), and -16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>38% of the sANLL patients have had clones with only one aberration and 3% have had unrelated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of these nonrandom abnormalities in sMDS and sANLL are thus remarkably similar - the only exception appears to be 5q-, which is more common in sMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also the mean number of abnormalities per case is similar - 5.3 in sMDS and 5.6 in sANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When the incidences of characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated with the type of previous therapy, -7 was found to be more frequent in sMDS and sANLL patients who had been exposed to chemotherapy whereas 5q- was associated with previous exposure to ionizing radiation in sMDS patients </plain></SENT>
