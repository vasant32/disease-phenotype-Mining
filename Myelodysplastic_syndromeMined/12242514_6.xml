<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of hemopoietic progenitor cell disorders, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> regularly develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and frequently become transfusion-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been tried to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with only limited success with response rates ranging from 16% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is becoming evident that the generally rather low response rate of EPO in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will be improved by the combination of EPO with either G-CSF or GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Here, we analyzed the results from the literature (six papers and one abstract using EPO plus G-CSF, and seven papers using EPO plus GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials the cytokine dose and schedule varied, and the response criteria were not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average response rate for improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was 41% in 207 patients treated with EPO and G-CSF, and 26% in 154 patients treated with EPO and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were higher response rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) (45%), ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) (47%), and excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) (38%) compared with blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) (17%) for the treatment with EPO plus G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding response rates for treatment with EPO plus GM-CSF were 30% (RA), 29% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 16% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 0% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged administration even showed a higher increment in the response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the combination of EPO with G-CSF is probably superior to EPO plus GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There seems to be a positive correlation between the duration of cytokine treatment and response rates, and higher response rates in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stages compared to advanced entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, controlled studies are mandatory to evaluate the role of the combined cytokine treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
