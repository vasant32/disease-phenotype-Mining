<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, let-7a down-regulates KRAS, which is aberrantly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression of the aforementioned microRNAs in CD34+ cells of 43 MDS patients using real-time PCR and their target proteins (E2F1, MYC, BCL2, CCND1, and KRAS) by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mir-17-5p and mir-20a were under expressed in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, compared to low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, let-7a was under expressed in patients with intermediate or high-risk karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between microRNA and the expression levels of their targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mir-17-5p and mir-20a constitute favorable prognostic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, since their expression was associated with increased overall survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
