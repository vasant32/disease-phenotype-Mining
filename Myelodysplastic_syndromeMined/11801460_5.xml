<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The French-American-British (FAB) co-operative group classifies them into five morphologic entities and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) proposes four groups of risk on the basis of clinical and cytogenetic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of the IPSS in our Argentine population, to test the prognostic value of its variables and to determine whether this score helps to associate prognostic subgroups of risk into FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-four patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a median follow-up of 28 months were evaluated using univariate analyses to determine median survival (SV) and the time to LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variables analyzed were FAB classification, IPSS, percentage of myeloblasts, cytogenetic groups of risk and number of cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables analyzed were predictive for SV and for LE in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application of the IPSS allowed discrimination into the 4 groups of risk and helped to identify prognostic subclasses among the FAB classification, associating 5%, 15% and 19% of cases with worse prognosis within the FAB classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts and RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IPSS was not informative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation cases and would not be applied to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This score could be applied to our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population, showing no geographic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratification of FAB patients according to IPSS would be helpful to develop risk-adapted therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
