<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), there is no consensus regarding patient or disease characteristics that predict outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We reviewed 37 consecutive pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who received myeloablative HSCT between 1990 and 2010 at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 17 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic cytogenetics included <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (n = 21), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (n = 7) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/other (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the modified WHO <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classification, thirty had refractory cytopenia and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IPSS scores were: low risk (n = 1), intermediate-1 (n = 15), and intermediate-2 (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OS and DFS at 10 years in the entire cohort was 53% and 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse at 10 years was 26% and 1 year TRM was 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, factors associated with improved 3 years DFS were not receiving pre-HSCT chemotherapy (RR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.88; P = 0.03) and a shorter interval (&lt;140 days) from time of diagnosis to transplant (RR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.80; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three years DFS in patients who did not receive pre-HSCT chemotherapy and those who had a shorter interval to transplant (n = 16) was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should be referred for allogeneic HSCT soon after diagnosis and that pre-HSCT chemotherapy does not appear to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
