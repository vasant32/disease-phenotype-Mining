<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of these patients had a preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical response was correlated to the results of cytogenetic studies (23 patients) and of viability studies of leukemic blasts (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 25 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 8 achieved partial remission (PR), and 4 showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was 1 toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and 1 patient died soon (1 week) after presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although myelotoxicity occurred regularly, the recovery time was &lt; or = 3 weeks for most of the responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of survival for patients who had CR has ranged from 4+ to 43+ months and for patients who had PR, 3 to 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the remission status (CR or PR), responding patients with favorable (n = 1) or intermediate (n = 10) cytogenetic findings had a significantly better survival time (median, 14 months) than did those with unfavorable (n = 7) cytogenetic findings (median, 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies showed a progressive reduction in the number of circulating blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of viable blasts 3 days after initiation of therapy appeared to give an early indication of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a flexible low-intensity protocol seems to achieve results comparable with those reported for intensive antileukemia therapy and has much less toxicity </plain></SENT>
