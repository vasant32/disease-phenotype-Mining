<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment on survival and leukemic transformation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the long-term outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with EPO plus G-CSF (n = 121) with untreated patients (n = 237) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using multivariate Cox regression with delayed entry, for the first time adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major prognostic variables (WHO classification, karyotype, cytopenias, level of transfusion-need, age, and sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The erythroid response rate to EPO plus G-CSF was 39%, and the median response duration 23 months (range, 3 to 116+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, treatment was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.83; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this positive association was primarily observed in patients requiring fewer than 2 units of RBCs per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was not linked to the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in any defined subgroup, including patients with an increase of marrow blasts or an unfavorable karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inherent risk of leukemic evolution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> makes the current investigation highly relevant, in light of the recent reports of potential negative effects of EPO treatment on outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with EPO plus G-CSF may have a positive impact on outcome in patients with no or low transfusion need, while not affecting the risk of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
