<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EVI1 is an aggressive nuclear oncoprotein deregulated by recurring chromosomal abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of the corresponding gene is a very poor prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and is associated with severe defects of the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the constitutive expression of EVI1 in murine bone marrow results in a fatal disease with features characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, dyserythropoiesis, and dysmegakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These lineages are regulated by the DNA-binding transcription factor GATA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVI1 has two zinc finger domains containing seven motifs at the N terminus and three motifs at the C terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supported by results of assays utilizing synthetic DNA promoters, it was earlier proposed that erythroid-lineage repression by EVI1 is based on the ability of this protein to compete with GATA1 for DNA-binding sites, resulting in repression of gene activation by GATA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, however, we show that EVI1 is unable to bind to classic GATA1 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanism utilized by EVI1 to repress erythropoiesis, we used a combination of biochemical assays, mutation analyses, and in vitro bone marrow differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that EVI1 interacts directly with the GATA1 protein rather than the DNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further show that this protein-protein interaction blocks efficient recognition or binding to DNA by GATA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Point mutations that disrupt the geometry of two zinc fingers of EVI1 abolish the protein-protein interaction, leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> murine bone marrow in vitro </plain></SENT>
