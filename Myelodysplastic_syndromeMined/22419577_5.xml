<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To explore this observation in a large population of patients, we report a post-hoc analysis evaluating hematologic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in a cohort of iron-overloaded patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> enrolled in the Evaluation of Patients' Iron Chelation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Exjade</z:chebi>(®) (EPIC) study using International Working Group 2006 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-seven, 100 and 50 patients without concomitant medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were eligible for analysis of erythroid, platelet and neutrophil responses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid, platelet and neutrophil responses were observed in 21.5% (53/247), 13.0% (13/100) and 22.0% (11/50) of the patients after a median of 109, 169 and 226 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median serum ferritin reductions were greater in hematologic responders compared with non-responders at end of study, although these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduction in labile plasma iron to less than 0.4 μmol/L was observed from week 12 onwards; this change did not differ between hematologic responders and non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment for up to 1 year could lead to improvement in hematologic parameters in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
