<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene is found in nearly 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our serial studies on 51 samples with the FLT3 gene mutation indicated that the ITD was frequently (47/51) clustered in the tyrosine-rich stretch from codon 589 to 599 and rarely (3/51) in its downstream region, both of which are located within the juxtamembrane (JM) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One remaining sample had an insertion into the JM domain of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the biological relevance of the ITD or the insertion, we expressed various types of mutant FLT3 in Cos 7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutant FLT3 studied were ligand-independently dimerized and their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> were phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Y589 of FLT3 was essential for the phosphorylation in the wild FLT3, but a Y589F conversion did not affect the phosphorylation status of the mutant FLT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the elongation of the JM domain rather than increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> causes gain-of-function of FLT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ITD is a novel modality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> which activates its product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the DNA corresponding to codon 593 to 602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate, we propose that a DNA-replication error might be associated with generating the ITD of the FLT3 gene </plain></SENT>
