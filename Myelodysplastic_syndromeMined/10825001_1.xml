<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in multiple members of a family has not been fully elucidated but data support the contribution of highly penetrant mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> susceptibility genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the genetic etiology of an unusual three-generation family with apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) accompanied by somatic loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells have been performed, confirming acquired hemi- and homozygous deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the chromosome lost in the observed LOH event is from the affected parent, in contradiction to the expectation for a two-hit hypothesis involving a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genetic linkage has been performed at 5q31-33 as well as other loci (21q22 and 16q21-23.2) previously implicated in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this family, linkage analysis excludes loci at 5q31-33 and 21q22, but localization to 16q21-23.2 cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a maximum multipoint LOD score of 1.19 between marker D16S265 and D16S503 at 16q22 (P = 0.03), suggesting possible linkage to this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering this family and the previous 16q-linked family together, the linkage of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> susceptibility gene to 16q22 achieved an LOD score of 3.63 at D16S265 with theta = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, somatic deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 appears as a necessary but surprisingly noncausative event for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in this family, thereby confirming a multistep etiology in which chromosome 5 plays an important secondary role </plain></SENT>
