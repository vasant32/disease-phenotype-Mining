<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The complete blood count (CBC) with differential leukocyte count (DIFF) is an important part of clinical laboratory analyses and provides crucial data for clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delivery time after blood collection and conditions of storage is known to affect the reliability of results of some hematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the variations of hematologic parameters over time and the influence of storage temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were randomly selected from hospitalized patients and stored at room temperature and at 4 °C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBC and DIFF were performed on an automated hematology analyzer and the results between the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Samples stored at room temperature showed an important increase in mean corpuscular volume and hematocrit and a decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001589'>mean corpuscular hemoglobin</z:mp> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil counts tended to increase, whereas monocyte counts tended to decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Storing samples at 4 °C improved reproducibility over time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quantitative and qualitative parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed that NEUT-X, a routine parameter useful in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, became unreliable when analyzed 24 h after sample collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results led us to recommend that samples should be analyzed within 6 h, particularly if samples are transported at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also recommend storing samples at 4 °C in case of remote CBC analysis, especially in the context of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
