<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 6 elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and were stimulated by cytokines in vitro to form CIK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autologous CIK cells were then infused back into the corresponding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effector cell proportion changes, adverse effects, effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and blood transfusion were assessed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that after autologous CIK cell infusion, the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD56(+) increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse effects were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also significantly reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> frequency and shortened high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During stable stage of disease, the CIK cell infusion could reduce the red blood cell infusion amount and stabilize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the natural course of transformation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> to high-risk subtypes could not be changed by CIK cell treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the autologous CIK cell infusion is a safe and effective therapy for geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
