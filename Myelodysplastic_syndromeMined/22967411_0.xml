<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical information, laboratory findings and survival time in 194 untreated primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with complete immunological laboratory tests or a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 37/194 cases (19.07%) with autoimmune abnormalities, including 16/194 (8.25%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and 21/194 asymptomatic cases (10.82%) with serologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant differences in the distribution of age &lt; 60 years old, female, CD4(+)T-cell/CD8(+)T-cell ration &lt; 1 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (P &lt; 0.05) between the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and without autoimmune abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former had a higher 2-year OS, but there was no significance (P = 0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant differences in the distribution of age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-subtype, IPSS risk groups, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, absolute neutrophil count, platelets count, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, high level of serologic TNF, chromosomal abnormalities, cytogenetic risk groups and bone marrow cellularity (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> are mainly female and yonger than 60 years old, with high proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and better prognosis </plain></SENT>
