<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes of interest included FLT3, PDGFRbeta, KDR, CSF2Rbeta, SOCS1, PIAS3 and SHIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coding sequence of these genes was analysed by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to search novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation (A &gt; T, Q1154L) of SHIP (1 of 192, 0.52%) was identified and another novel mutation (C &gt; T, R685C) of PDGFRbeta (2 of 192, 1.04%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, FLT3 mutations were seen in three of five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (60%) and 39 of 268 (14.6%) de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the coding sequence regions of KDR, CSF2Rbeta, SOCS1 or PIAS3 </plain></SENT>
