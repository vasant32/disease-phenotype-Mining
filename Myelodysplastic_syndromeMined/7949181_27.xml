<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acquired deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are found in several hematologic conditions and particularly in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of diseases associated with 20q deletions suggests that such deletions may mark the site of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene that contributes to the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> multipotent hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here the first detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions associated with myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four microsatellite primer pairs corresponding to loci on 20q have been used to study DNA samples from two cell lines and from highly purified peripheral blood granulocytes obtained from seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Southern analysis of cell line DNA has been performed using 19 DNA probes that map to 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three conclusions can be drawn from our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Firstly, molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of both centromeric and telomeric breakpoints was demonstrated, thus supporting the existence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene on 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition many of the breakpoints have been mapped to small genetic intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, our results define a commonly deleted region of 16-21 cM which contains <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, PLC1, TOP1, SEMG1, and PPGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes lie outside the common deleted region including SRC, HCK, p107, PTPN1, and CEBP beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the data allow integration of genetic and physical maps and have refined the map positions of multiple genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results will facilitate attempts to identify candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> suppressor genes on 20q </plain></SENT>
