<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with a refractory testicular non-seminomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumor</z:mpath> (NSGCT) who developed therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (TRL) after undergoing salvage chemotherapy and multiple operations for repeat recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty months after the initial therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and myeloblasts were observed in the patient's peripheral blood while the patient was undergoing salvage chemotherapy for a fifth recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow examination showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in T) under French-America-British (FAB) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic 5q-/7q- abnormalities were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had received a total dose of 189g/m2 of Ifosfamide, 8,250mg/m2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> and 1,450 mg/m2 of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">Cisplatin</z:chebi>; therefore, he was diagnosed as having TRL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient has received induction chemotherapy for TRL with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">Daunorubicin</z:chebi> and Fludarabine while a bone marrow transplantation has been scheduled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, TRL associated with chemotherapy are being reported with increasing frequency in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since early detection and treatment are necessary for the management of TRL, peripheral blood examinations should be performed after a diagnosis of refractory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumor</z:mpath> has been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is detected, bone marrow and cytogenetic examinations should be immediately performed to rule out TRL </plain></SENT>
