<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have focused on the analysis of del(7q), demonstrating the presence of several minimal deleted regions in 7q22 approximately q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, few studies in myeloid disorders have been devoted to the analysis of translocations, either balanced or unbalanced, involving 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize the 7q31.3 approximately q34 region (markers D7S480-D7S2227) in patients with deletion or translocation of 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 910 cases of myeloid disorders were studied by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight (6%) patients had structural aberrations of 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH studies were carried out in the 27 patients with involvement of 7q31 approximately q34: 14 cases had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and 13 cases had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis revealed the existence of high complexity in the 7q31.3 approximately q34 region in patients with unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No breakpoints in 7q31.3 approximately q34 were found in the cases with deletion or balanced translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, studies of unbalanced translocations showed several breakpoints in markers D7S480-D7S2227, which delineate a commonly altered region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The complexity of 7q rearrangements suggests that a synergy of different genetic factors, rather than the alteration of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, could be involved in the pathogenesis of del(7q) in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
