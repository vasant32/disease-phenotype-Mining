<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the relatively low incidence rate of sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, these analyses are primarily exploratory in nature but provide some insight into relevant risk factors and illustrate the risk of developing sMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after myeloablative conditioning and ASCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
