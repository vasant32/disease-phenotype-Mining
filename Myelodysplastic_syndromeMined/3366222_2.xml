<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The haematological features were variable, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in 14 cases (20%), bicytopenia in 24 (36%) and mono-cytopenia in the remaining patients, including 21 (30%) cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> alone, 8 (12%) cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and 2 (3%) cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic features were also quite variable, involving one, two or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with a single cytopenia or only one dysplastic lineage, FAB criteria appeared insufficient for adequate inclusion among RA and we suggest more precise diagnostic criteria, resulting from the utilization of cytogenetics, ferrokinetics, progenitor cultures and perhaps molecular biology, in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12 patients (17%) progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (of whom 7 finally developed ANLL) and 4 patients (6%) to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of haematological features, only two factors were associated with poor prognosis, namely age greater than 70 yr at diagnosis and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> less than 10 g/dl, whereas, to a lesser extent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was associated with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
