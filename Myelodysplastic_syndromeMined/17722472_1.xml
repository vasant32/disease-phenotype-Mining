<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently various investigators have reported that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is associated not only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> but also with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have measured bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) in 43 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and in 10 subjects of group control--10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (their bone marrow was free of disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was estimated by immunohistochemical method using anti-CD31 and anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 MDS patients and 6 healthy donors we also measured serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunoenzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher MVD numbers were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients when compared to control bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest number of MVD was in RAEBt and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes according to FAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between MVD and biological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients except for the age (negative correlation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow microvessel density does not influenced significantly on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serum VEGF concentration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was higher than in healthy donors, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The VEGF levels did not correlate with MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that angogenesis is enhanced in bone marrow <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients though its mechamism is not yet fully understood </plain></SENT>
