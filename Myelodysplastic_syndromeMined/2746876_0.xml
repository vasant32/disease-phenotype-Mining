<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in July 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was given since September 1984, and melphalan was added since June 1986 </plain></SENT>
