<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Copy Number Aberration (CNA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) study using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have been received increasingly attentions in the recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, a new Constraint Moving Average (CMA) algorithm is adopted to determine the regions of CNA regions first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to large regions of CNA, using the proposed CMA algorithm, small regions of CNA can also be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) results prove that the CMA algorithm presents an insightful discovery of both large and subtle regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of CMA, two independent applications are studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first one is power analysis for sample estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An accurate estimation of sample size needed for the desired purpose of an experiment will be important for effort-efficiency and cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The power analysis is performed to determine the minimum sample size required for ensuring at least (0&lt;lambda &lt;or=) detected regions statistically different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, power increase with increasing sample size for a fixed significance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second application is the distinguishment of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from low-grade ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose to calculate the General Variant Level (GVL) score to integrate the general information of each patient at genotype level, and use it as the unified measurement for the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classifications usually refer to cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which belongs to the classification at the phenotype level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proposed GVL score integrates the information of CNA region, the number of abnormal chromosomes and the total number of the altered SNPs at the genotype level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests indicate that the high and low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients can be well separated by GVL score, which appears to correlate better with clinical outcome than the traditional classification approaches using <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and IPSS sore at the phenotype level </plain></SENT>
