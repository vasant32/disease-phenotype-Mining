<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>79 cases of refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 21 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with GHA standard priming chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical efficiency, side effects, and therapy-relevant mortality were observed in comparison with MA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of costimulatory molecule B7.1 was detected by immunofluorescence and its relationship with clinical efficiency was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the remission rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 60.7% (complete remission rate was 43% and partial remission rate was 17.7%), and that was 52.4% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of granulocyte deficiency was 25% during 3.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was 3%, without severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, with mild digest effect, and slight damage of function in heart, liver, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The therapy-related mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The higher CR rate was in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M(2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M(5) (60.9%, 61.9%), and the longest remission period was 4 years; expression rate of costimulatory molecule B7.1 displayed large variance (0% - 66.7%) and had positive correlation with efficiency of priming chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of B7.1 expression was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M(2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M(5) and lower in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that GHA priming chemotherapy can be used to treat refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, without severe side effects, toxicity and therapy-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is a new chemotherapy protocol with better effect and low toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Efficiency of GHA priming chemotherapy may be correlated with B7.1 expression </plain></SENT>
