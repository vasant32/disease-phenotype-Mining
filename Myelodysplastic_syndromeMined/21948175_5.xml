<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns have been raised about the possibility that MSCs undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies, including one from our own group, have shown the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in MSCs from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare genetic aberrations in hematopoietic cells (HCs) and MSCs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 25 of 51 AML patients (49%) and 16 of 43 MDS patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the FLT3 and NPM1 genes were detected in leukemic blasts in 12 (23%) and 8 (16%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations in MSCs were detected in 15 of 94 MDS/AML patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No chromosomal abnormalities were identified in MSCs of 36 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate herein that MSCs have distinct genetic abnormalities compared with leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the main characteristics of patients with MSCs carrying chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of these data, the genetic alterations in MSCs may constitute a particular mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
