<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BM grafts were collected at 107 centers and PBPC, 89 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median time from end of collection to infusion was 14 hours for BM and 15 hours for PBPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery was less likely in BM recipients when the interval from end of collection to receipt at transplant center was &gt;or=20 hours (odds ratio 0.47, P = .010) and when the interval from receipt to infusion was &gt;or=6 hours (odds ratio 0.57, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were higher in recipients of HLA-matched BM when the interval from end of collection to receipt at transplant center was &gt;or=20 hours (relative risk 2.67, P &lt; .001) after adjustment for other significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality after HLA-mismatched BM transplants was not associated with transport time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transport times had no demonstrable effect on outcomes after PBPC transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support a general review of current transport procedures, especially for BM grafts requiring longer transport time and every effort made to minimize time from collection to infusion </plain></SENT>
