<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From January 2000 to December 2010, 108 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=63) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=45) received PBSC after RIC in our center, either from siblings (n=70) or from matched unrelated donors (MUD; 10/10 high resolution, n=38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen was fludarabine based in 95% of patients and GvHD prophylaxis was mostly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were similar between sibling and MUD for age (median 57 years), gender and disease distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen (more anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in MUD), donor age (younger for MUD) and number of CD34+ cells infused (higher in MUD) were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 36 months (range 2-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Engraftment, GvHD, TRM, relapse rate and OS at 3 years were comparable between sibling and MUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, cytogenetic risk, ATG and number of CD34+ cells infused, donor type still did not influence OS </plain></SENT>
