<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The incidence of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after epipodophyllotoxin treatment and the relationship between epipodophyllotoxin cumulative dose and risk are not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI) has developed a monitoring plan to obtain reliable estimates of the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after epipodophyllotoxin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve NCI-supported cooperative group clinical trials were identified that use epipodophyllotoxins at low (&lt;1.5 g/m2 etoposide), moderate (1.5 to 2.99 g/m2 etoposide), or higher (&gt; or =3.0 g/m2 etoposide) cumulative doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (including treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) occurring on these trials have been reported to CTEP, as has duration of follow-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, thereby allowing calculation of cumulative 6-year incidence rates of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> for each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The calculated cumulative 6-year risks for development of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> for the low, moderate, and higher cumulative dose groups were 3.3%, (95% upper confidence bound of 5.9%), 0.7% (95% upper confidence bound of 1.6%), and 2.2%, (95% upper confidence bound of 4.6%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Within the context of the epipodophyllotoxin cumulative dose range and schedules of administration encompassed by the monitoring plan regimens, and within the context of multiagent chemotherapy regimens that include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and other agents, factors other than epipodophyllotoxin cumulative dose seem to be of primary importance in determining the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data obtained by the CTEP secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> monitoring plan support the relative safety of using epipodophyllotoxins according to the therapeutic plans outlined in the monitored protocols </plain></SENT>
