<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the development of a spontaneous subcapsular splenic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> following filgrastim administration in a patient undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was admitted for a reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She received filgrastim 5 Î¼g/kg starting on day 1 to accelerate neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 5, she began reporting severe left chest-wall pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a spontaneous subcapsular splenic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon discontinuation of filgrastim, the pain fully resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was subsequently rechallenged with filgrastim, which led to recurrence of the left-sided chest-wall pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Filgrastim was discontinued and the patient reported resolution of the pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Filgrastim has been associated with splenic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and splenic rupture, predominantly in healthy donors undergoing mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although splenic rupture attributed to filgrastim in a patient undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported, to our knowledge, this is the first case report to establish causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the Naranjo probability scale, an objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was highly probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although filgrastim-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, splenic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, and splenic rupture are rare, clinicians working in the bone marrow transplant setting should be cognizant of the potential of growth factors to cause these adverse events </plain></SENT>
