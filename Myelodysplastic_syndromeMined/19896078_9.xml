<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of race and SES, we studied 6207 unrelated-donor myeloablative (MA) HCT recipients transplanted between 1995 and 2004 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were reported by transplant center to be White (n = 5253), African American (n = 368), Asian/Pacific-Islander (n = 141), or Hispanic (n = 445) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient income was estimated from residential zip code at time of HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis adjusting for other significant factors showed that African American (but not Asian or Hispanic) recipients had worse overall survival (OS) (relative-risk [RR] 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.68, P &lt; .001) compared to Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in African Americans (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.34-1.83, P &lt; .001) and in Hispanics (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.11-1.51, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial groups, patients with median incomes in the lowest quartile (&lt;$34,700) had worse OS (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.26, P = .005) and higher risks of TRM (RR 1.21; 1.07-1.36, P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inferior outcomes among African Americans are not fully explained by transplant-related factors or SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential other mechanisms such as genetic polymorphisms that have an impact on drug metabolism or unmeasured comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and health behaviors may be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low SES, regardless of race, has a negative impact on unrelated donor HCT outcomes </plain></SENT>
