<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based only on age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients were offered one of two specific transplant protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients &lt; or =50 years old received conventional high-dose conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-TBI and use of CD34+-selected PBSCT (CTCD34+ group), while patients aged &gt;50 years received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with fludarabine and oral busulphan (FB-RIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients entered the study (35 in the CTCD34+ and 39 in the FB-RIC group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was &gt;4 years in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 4-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 19 and 20%, respectively (P=0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse and survival were also equivalent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in this setting, the expected high NRM in elderly patients can be reduced with an RIC regimen </plain></SENT>
