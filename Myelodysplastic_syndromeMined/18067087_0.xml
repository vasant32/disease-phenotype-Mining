<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected at presentation, prepared by short-time unstimulated culture and R-binding, and karyotyped by conventional cytogenetical assay (CCA); megalokaryocytes were detected by Streptavidin-AKP (SAP); immunotype of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells was tested by flow cytometric anylysis of surface antigens (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 9 hematopoietic malignant patients with t(3;3)(q21;q26) or inv(3) (q21q26) manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and poor treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of them relapsed shortly after allogenic hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with 3q21q26 rearrangement can be found in various hematopoietic malignances and demonstrate an unique entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients show poor treatment response and have extremely poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
