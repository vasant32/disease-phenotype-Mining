<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the Pa promoter of c-abl was methylated in 81% (17/21) of the white blood cells (WBCs) of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients, which correlates with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WBCs from healthy donors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were unmethylated at the c-abl Pa promoter locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed p15 hypermethylation in 24% (8/34) of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the p15 but not c-abl Pa promoters was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> progression (P = 0.047 vs 0.46), and the two events were independently acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that de novo methylation of c-abl and p15 both occur in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and analysis of DNA methylation changes using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-based MS-SNuPE assay allows both a sensitive and quantitative assessment of these molecular events compared to other methods currently utilized </plain></SENT>
