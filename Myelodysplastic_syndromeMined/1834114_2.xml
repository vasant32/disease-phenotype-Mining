<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> a complete remission rate of 43% was found and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients profound cytopenia was noticed without any sign of maturation induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> no effect of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effect of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in vitro in freshly isolated leukaemic cells of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maturation induction was measured by a comprehensive panel of quantitative and qualitative markers of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differentiation inducing effect of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude on the basis of our own results and after reviewing the literature that low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> exerts its effect by cytotoxicity instead of maturation induction </plain></SENT>
