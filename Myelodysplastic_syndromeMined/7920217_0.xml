<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the predictive role of bone marrow culturing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in vitro data of 205 patients were correlated with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro growth pattern and in vitro differentiation were significantly predictive for progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other predictive parameters were FAB classification and the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since FAB classification and in vitro bone marrow culturing appeared confounding variables, the in vitro data were analysed for high risk patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and RAEBt and low risk patients, RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 91/110 RAEB(t) patients the estimated chance to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 25% in cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth versus 62% if abnormal (p &lt; 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 82/87 RA(RS) patients the estimated chance to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 5% and 40% respectively (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression median survival was only 2 months (0-16.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>(t) patients bone marrow culturing did not discriminate for better survival, although a trend was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated median survival was 16 months if growth was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus 8 months if abnormal (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In RA(RS) patients the median survival also was not significantly different, 31 versus 22 months respectively (p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, if in vitro growth and differentiation were both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> a significant difference in median survival was observed, 35 versus 22 months (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in vitro bone marrow culturing has predictive value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development in RA(RS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>(t), due to many patients dying early in cytopenia, the predictive value is less pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Especially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth in RA(RS) patients makes progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> very unlikely and these patients should be considered for a supportive approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In RA(RS) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and differentiation (about 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) in vitro bone marrow culturing also predicts a better survival </plain></SENT>
