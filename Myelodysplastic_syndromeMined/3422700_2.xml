<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> for 20 years before developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis at the myelodysplastic stage disclosed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in bone marrow mitoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of fractionated white blood cells with the chromosome 7-specific probes MetH and MetD revealed that blood monocytes and most bone marrow erythroblasts but not blood granulocytes or lymphocytes were affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient later developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with blast cells positive for markers of the myelomonocytic lineage but negative for granulocytic markers in a standard surface marker analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The leukemic blast cells had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 as determined by direct cytogenetic investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the monocytes were found to be affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in this patient 8 months before her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, and the affected cells had the same biologic markers at both stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
