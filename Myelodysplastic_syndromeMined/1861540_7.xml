<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the disturbed red cell proliferation and maturation is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to study the role of erythropoietic growth factors, we determined by radioimmunoassay the serum concentrations of immunoreactive erythropoietin (Epo) in 42 non-transfused patients with primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration at the time of Epo measurement was 9.1 g/dl (range, 5.7-14.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, 83% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had increased serum Epo levels, ranging from 26-4530 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although in the entire patient population an inverse relationship between serum Epo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations was noted (r = -0.35; p = 0.02), Epo titers differed markedly between patients at comparable degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients presenting with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration between 5.9 and 11.9 g/dl, excessive elevations of Epo levels (greater than 500 mU/ml) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous observations, serum Epo concentrations were not shown to correlate with the percentage of erythroblasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significant relationship between the Epo activity and the degree of medullary dyserythropoiesis, as assessed by morphological criteria (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not due to an endogenous Epo deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marked variability of Epo production in these disorders is not fully explained by the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, but may also reflect inherent abnormalities of the myelodysplastic erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
