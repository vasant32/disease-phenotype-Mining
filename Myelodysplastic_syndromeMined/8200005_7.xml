<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) remains unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A limited number of reports provide contradictory information on whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi>, a synthetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>, may be useful in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1984 and 1992, 76 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> (Danatrol, Winthrop) in an open nonrandomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical status, blood counts, differential marrow cell counts, transfusion requirements, and liver enzymes were monitored at 3-month intervals during and 6 months after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors present the retrospective analysis of this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study shows a limited usefulness of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood counts were not significantly changed during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> administration; neither were transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and the rate of leukemic transformation were not affected when compared with 50 untreated patients or with data available in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in platelet numbers in four patients and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level in one patient was observed; these patients were unremarkable and were not transfused before initial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> therapy; therefore, changes in blood counts were of limited clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The search for subgroups of patients likely to have a favorable response was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, this study provides information on the frequency of antiplatelet antibodies and other autoantibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support a positive effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> during long term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anecdotal positive evolution in a few patients cannot be formally ascribed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results should be interpreted by comparison with previous publications that report on small numbers of patients with limited follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, the authors cannot recommend the systematic use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
