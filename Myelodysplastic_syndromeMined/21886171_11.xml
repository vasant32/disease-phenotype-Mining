<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a median of 169 days after HSCT, 20/59 prospectively screened patients experienced a decrease of CD34(+) donor chimerism to &lt;80% and received four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> cycles (75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days) while in complete hematologic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 patients (80%) responded with either increasing CD34(+) donor chimerism to ≥80% (n=10; 50%) or stabilization (n=6; 30%) in the absence of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stabilized patients and those with a later drop of CD34(+) donor chimerism to &lt;80% after initial response were eligible for subsequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients (55%) received a median of 4 (range, 1-11) additional cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eventually, hematologic relapse occurred in 13 patients (65%), but was delayed until a median of 231 days (range, 56-558) after initial decrease of CD34(+) donor chimerism to &lt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pre-emptive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> treatment has an acceptable safety profile and can substantially prevent or delay hematologic relapse in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> after allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
