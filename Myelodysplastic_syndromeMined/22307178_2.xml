<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry (FC) is increasingly recognized as an important tool in the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, validation of current assays and agreement upon the techniques are prerequisites for its widespread acceptance and application in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a working group was initiated (Amsterdam, 2008) to discuss and propose standards for FC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2009 and 2010, representatives from 23, mainly European, institutes participated in the second and third European LeukemiaNet (ELN) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> workshops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present report, minimal requirements to analyze <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are refined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed core markers should enable a categorization of FC results in cytopenic patients as '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>', 'suggestive of', or 'diagnostic of' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An FC report should include a description of validated FC abnormalities such as aberrant marker expression on myeloid progenitors and, furthermore, dysgranulopoiesis and/or dysmonocytopoiesis, if at least two abnormalities are evidenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The working group is dedicated to initiate further studies to establish robust diagnostic and prognostic FC panels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An ultimate goal is to refine and improve diagnosis and prognostic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the working group stresses that FC should be part of an integrated diagnosis rather than a separate technique </plain></SENT>
