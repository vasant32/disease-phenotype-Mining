<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analogs of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 that have greater potency may have the potential as adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients in remission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new generation of 11 analogs of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 has been synthesized, and we examined their effects on the human leukemic cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cell line provides a sensitive monitor of activity of the 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the compounds were potent, producing a 50% clonal inhibition (ED50) in the range of 10(-8) to 10(-11) mol/L; nine of the 11 analogs had ED50s at concentrations that were at least 10-fold lower than those for the parental 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most active compound [cmpd LA, (22R)-1 alpha, 25-(OH)2-16,22,23-triene-D3] had an ED50 of 2 x 10(-11) mol/L; it was also tested on clonogenic cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and it achieved an ED50 of approximately 6 x 10(-11) mol/L, while 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 produced an ED50 of approximately 10(-8) mol/L on the same population of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five different cell surface markers were examined on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells exposed to the 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs: HLA-DR and CD11b were induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the compounds; CD13 was induced by six of the 12 compounds, including 1,25(OH)2D3; CD14 was strongly induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compounds; and CD38 was induced rather weakly by nine of 12 analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WAF1/CIP1/p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), which is important in blocking the cell cycle, was examined by Western blot and was found to be induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the compounds, suggesting a possible mechanism by which these analogs inhibit leukemic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of WAF1 occurred at concentrations of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> analogs as low as 10(-10) mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This structure-function study showed that a new series of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs was active in clonal inhibition, as well as induction of differentiation and WAF1 expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The key structural motifs included C-16 double bond, double and/or triple bonds in the side chain, lengthening of the side chain, 20-epi-conformation of the side chain, replacement of six hydrogens at the end of the side chain with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="24061,30236">fluorines</z:chebi>, and the removal of C-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consideration should be given to further in vivo testing of toxicity and efficacy to move toward a clinical trial, especially in a setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
