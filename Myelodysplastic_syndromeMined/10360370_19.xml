<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF, 5 microg/kg/day, was administered after chemotherapy in patients aged more than 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in complete remission (CR) received one course of consolidation using the same schedule as for induction except the araC administration was shortened to 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some patients younger than 70 years were then scheduled for autologous stem cell harvest on days 5 to 7 of G-CSF, 5 microg/kg/day, initiated after hematopoietic recovery from consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous transplantation was performed following an additional chemotherapy conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five patients (59%) achieved CR, without significant difference between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (56% CR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (63% CR) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference in CR rate between de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (63%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> (55%) (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &lt; 70 years had 67% CR, while patients aged &gt; or = 70 years had 49% (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to neutrophil recovery was 22 days in patients who received G-CSF following induction and 27 days in patients who did not (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe extrahematologic toxicities of induction did not differ between the two arms and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (39%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 14 patients (9%), died from toxicity of induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First consolidation was administered in 74 patients of whom seven (9%) died from toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients have received transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median time to recovery of neutrophils &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 13 days and of platelets &gt; 50 x 10(9)/l 43 days following consolidation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free survival and survival from time of achieving CR of non transplanted patients are 6 and 7 months respectively without difference between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Fourteen transplanted patients relapsed at a median of 5 months post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this regimen is well tolerated and has a good efficacy to induce CR, without a significant difference in efficacy and toxicity between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Intensive postinduction, including transplantation, is feasible; however, this procedure did not seem to prevent early relapse in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Neither the high rate of CR nor consolidation nor transplant procedure in a selected group of patients did translate into improved DFS and/or survival </plain></SENT>
