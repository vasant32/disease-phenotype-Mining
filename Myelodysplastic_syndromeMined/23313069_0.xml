<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We assessed for CD30 expression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to examine the possibility that anti-CD30 could be targeted therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis was performed on bone marrow aspirates of 135 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and peripheral blood samples in a subset of 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on bone marrow aspirate clot specimens of 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median patient age was 63 years (range, 13-92 years); 102 (75%) patients had refractory or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, and 68 (50%) had high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the median percentage of blasts positive for CD30 was 14% (range, 0%-91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using an arbitrary 20% cutoff, 49 (36%) patients were considered to have CD30 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monocytic cells, either mature or immature, were consistently negative for CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CD30 expression was less in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with monocytic differentiation (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with persistent disease who had been actively treated had a higher level of CD30 expression than the patients who were untreated (P = .031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In paired samples, CD30 expression was consistently higher in bone marrow blasts than in peripheral blood blasts (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CD30 expression by myeloblasts in a subset of patients, but reactivity was generally weaker and focally compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD30 is expressed by myeloblasts in a substantial subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the study group was composed mostly of patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in whom very few treatment options are available, these data raise the possibility that anti-CD30-targeted therapy could be a potential option for this patient group </plain></SENT>
