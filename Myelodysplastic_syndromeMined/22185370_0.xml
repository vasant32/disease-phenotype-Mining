<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital medical records from 32 of the 39 patients having received TPO-ra from 2009 to 1 May 2011 were available for data collection and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 15 received TPO-ra for refractory primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, 7 for secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans syndrome</z:e>, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>) and 10 were treated for non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (chemotherapy-induced, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo> and suspected chemically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial response to TPO-ra defined as platelet counts &gt;30 Ã— 10(9)/l after 4 weeks of treatment was found in 59% of primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, 57% of patients with secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and 40% of patients with non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the cohort, three of which were related to pre-existing medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otherwise adverse effects were in general mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This Danish retrospective registration study has demonstrated that in the off-protocol setting, the use of TPO-ra is associated with response rates largely similar to those seen in previous protocol-monitored studies and no new adverse events were reported </plain></SENT>
