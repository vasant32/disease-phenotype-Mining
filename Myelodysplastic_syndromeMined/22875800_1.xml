<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focusing on patients with a lower risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation, 18 (34.6%) of 52 patients studied displayed an altered Treg compartment compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delineation of unique Treg subsets revealed that an increase in the absolute number of CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)CD45RA(-)CD27(-) Tregs (effector memory Tregs [Treg(EM)]) was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.046), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = 0.038), and blast counts â‰¥5% (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In healthy donors, this Treg(EM) population constitutes only 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Tregs (one to six Tregs per microliter) in peripheral blood but, when isolated, exhibit greater suppressive activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 3.1 y (range 2.7-4.9 y) from sample acquisition, increased numbers of Treg(EM) cells proved to have independent prognostic importance in survival estimates, suggesting that enumeration of this Treg subset may be a more reliable indicator of immunological escape than FOXP3(+) T cells as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on multivariate analyses, Treg(EM) impacted survival independently from myeloblast characteristics, cytopenias, karyotype, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, Treg(EM) cell expansion may be synonymous with human Treg activation and indicate microenvironmental changes conducive to transformation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
