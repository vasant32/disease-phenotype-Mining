<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODSPatients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> 20 mg/m(2) SC per day for 3 consecutive days on days 1, 2, and 3 every 28 days (schedule A) or 20 mg/m(2) SC per day once every 7 days on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days (schedule B) for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy end point was overall improvement rate (OIR: complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], marrow CR [mCR], or hematologic improvement [HI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were HI, transfusion independence, cytogenetic response, overall survival (OS), and time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: schedule A, n = 43; schedule B, n = 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis to treatment was 3.6 months; 89% had de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial was terminated early on achievement of protocol-defined OIR superiority of schedule A over schedule B; OIR was 23% for schedule A (seven CRs, three HIs) and 23% for schedule B (one mCR, one PR, three HIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median OS was not reached; approximately 70% of patients were alive at 500 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in schedule A (67%) and schedule B (59%) were RBC/platelet independent on study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent drug-related adverse events overall were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (28% v 36%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (23% v 18%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (16% v 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONIn this phase II study, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> showed promising results in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
