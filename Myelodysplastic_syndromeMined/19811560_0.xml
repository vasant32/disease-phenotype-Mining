<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   According to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), sole +8 is categorized as intermediate cytogenetic subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But as some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with +8 perhaps progress quickly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and have shorter survival, some reports have suggested that +8 should be categorized into poor risk cytogenetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic role of +8 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by comparing patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 20q- and -7/7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   The consecutive samples of 435 MDS patients in Shanghai were collected by prospective methods and diagnosed according to World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed using conventional G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was estimated by univariate Log-rank method and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Of 424 cases completing the cytogenetic analysis, 71 (16.7%) had +8, including 38 patients with sole +8 (9.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in median survival was observed between patients with sole +8 and that with +8 and one of other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The +8 clone size was not linked to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients with +8, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and complex karyotype was 25months, 38.1months and 5.9months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed between patients with 20q- (21.4months) and -7/7q- (25.8months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 was an independent prognostic factor by Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   There is no significant difference in prognosis between patients with +8 and patients with 20q- or -7/7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8, 20q- and -7/7q- are categorized as intermediate cytogenetic risk according to our primary study </plain></SENT>
