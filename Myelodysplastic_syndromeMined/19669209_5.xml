<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPN) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) occasionally demonstrate overlapping morphological features including hypercellularity, mild/nonspecific dysplastic changes and variable bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, when the associated bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> results in a suboptimal specimen for morphological evaluation, the descriptive diagnosis "fibrotic marrow with features indeterminate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus MPN" is often applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The JAK2 ( V617F ) mutation was recently shown to be frequently identified in MPN, but it is rarely present in other myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnostic utility of JAK2 ( V617F ) screening in hypercellular bone marrow specimens with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> has not been previously investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction melting-curve assay capable of detecting JAK2 ( V617F ) in archived fixed materials, we retrospectively studied JAK2 ( V617F ) in 45 cases with fibrotic hypercellular bone marrow at initial presentation, including 19 cases initially described as "with features indeterminate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus MPN" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 19 cases were reclassified into more specific categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 14) or MPN (n = 5) based on the availability of subsequent clinical data and/or bone marrow examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The JAK2 ( V617F ) allele was identified in 17 out of 18 BCR/ABL gene-negative MPN cases with marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, whereas only <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles were identified in the remaining non-MPN cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, JAK2 ( V617F ) alleles were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases of "with features indeterminate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus MPN" at initial presentation that were later determined to be MPN, but they were absent in the 14 cases later determined to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that JAK2 ( V617F ) allele evaluation can be a useful ancillary test for discriminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from MPN in specimens with bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
