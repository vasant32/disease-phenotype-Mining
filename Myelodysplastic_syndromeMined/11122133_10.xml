<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) after autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) induces a systemic autoimmune syndrome mimicking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome, termed autologous GVHD has notable anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We intended to induce autologous GVHD with CyA in patients undergoing an autologous HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 118 patients with miscellaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> undergoing an autologous HSCT with low-dose CyA to characterize the clinical syndrome, its frequency and clinical course, and to determine the factors affecting its incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received CyA from d -1 through to d 28, first starting at 2 mg/kg intravenously and then orally as soon as feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose was adjusted to achieve pre-dose blood levels around 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy was performed when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of the patients developed clinical GVHD: clinical stage 1 in 21 patients, stage 2 in seven patients, and stage 3 in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although total body irradiation (TBI) or high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> were previously thought to be needed, autologous GVHD occurred in five out of 12 patients (42%) after a preparative regimen with high-dose melphalan alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autologous GVHD was significantly more frequent in patients older than 33 years, in patients who had received high doses of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) and in those with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e>, compared with those with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant negative association was also found with HLA-DR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, GVHD occurred more frequently in advanced disease than in first or second complete remission (CR1-2) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other factors studied were not predictive for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CyA-induced GVHD is reproducibly and safely induced with doses of CyA adapted to achieve blood levels around 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In retrospective analysis, there was no survival advantage for patients with GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Phase III trials with this approach are needed to evaluate its anti-tumoral effect </plain></SENT>
