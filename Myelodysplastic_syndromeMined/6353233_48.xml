<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 2067 patients given semustine (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CCNU) as adjuvant therapy, leukemic disorders developed in 14, whereas only one leukemic disorder (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) occurred among 1566 patients given other therapies (relative risk = 12.4; 95 per cent confidence interval = 1.7 to 250) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The six-year cumulative mean risk (+/- S.E.) of acquiring a leukemic disorder after treatment with semustine was 4.0 +/- 2.2 per cent; the incidence rate was 2.3 cases per 1000 persons per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk increased significantly with time after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of leukemic disorders did not differ according to sex, race, age at treatment, or initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, nor was it enhanced by concomitant radiotherapy or immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, no excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was seen in 44,370 patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> in Connecticut during the period 1935 to 1974, before the advent of nitrosourea chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides quantitative evidence that nitrosoureas are leukemogenic in human beings and confirms previous observations that adjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
