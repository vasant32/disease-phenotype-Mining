<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is general agreement that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (programmed/physiological cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) plays an important role in regulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and that so-called naked nuclei (NN) present end stages of megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using in situ end-labeling techniques (ISEL), a morphometric analysis was performed on bone marrow trephine biopsies repeatedly derived from patients with idiopathic (primary) osteo-/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (IMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to quantify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and to elucidate its relationship with NN of megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, evolution of this phenomenon during progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (assessed by morphometry of silver-stained sequential biopsies) and its predictive value were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In IMF, morphometric measurements revealed a rate of ISEL-positive cells that was significantly higher than previously published data on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, but lower than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, NN with their tightly packed (nuclear) lobules and condensed chromatin were not reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation failed to show a significant correlation between incidence of apoptotic cells and fiber density or an increase in this feature associated with progression of fibro-osteosclerotic marrow changes and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The failure of NN to react in ISEL implicates an absence of DNA fragmentation characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this reason our findings are in keeping with the assumption that NN are compatible with para-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
