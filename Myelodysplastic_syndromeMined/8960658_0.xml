<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the signal transduction of the leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the blasts by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro proliferation of leukemic blasts was stimulated by M-CSF, but not by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based upon these findings, combined therapy with M-CSF and low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After her recovery, we confirmed marked reduction of blasts and disappearance of M-CSF-responsive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that M-CSF could enhance the cytotoxic effect of ara-C on leukemic blasts via its intracellular signaling pathway linked to proliferation </plain></SENT>
