<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the DNA content of bone marrow cells with flow cytometry in 19 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in 70 patients who had recently been diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of the patients were found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was not related to the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, and there was no demarcation in terms of DNA content between patients with a high percentage of blast cells and those with a low percentage of such cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypodiploid marrow cells had a significantly shorter survival time than other patients (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with hyperdiploid marrow and those whose marrow had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA content had similar survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypodiploidy appears to be a better indicator of poor survival than the marrow blast-cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> invariably had cells with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high DNA content; none of these patients died during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that there is a relation between the loss of chromosomal material and progression toward a leukemic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that this process may involve a loss of negative regulatory genes ("anti-oncogenes") </plain></SENT>
