<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the similarities, there is great <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among the syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent insights have shown, however, that there exists a biologically cohesive theme that unifies and thereby validates the conceptual interconnectedness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first suggestion that such a relationship existed where biology could directly explain the observed cytopenias was the finding of excessive premature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was mediated by paracrine as well as autocrine factors implicating both the seed and the soil in the pathology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the marrow microenvironment were mainly the paracrine mediators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but how the clonal cells committed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> because of autocrine stimulation had remained a mystery for more than a decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been shown now that deregulation of ribosome biogenesis can initiate a stress response in the cell through the p53 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> had been associated with mutations in ribosomal protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The surprise came with the investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> patients where haplo-insufficiency of the ribosomal protein gene RPS14 was found to be the cause of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar ribosomal deregulation was shown to be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> varieties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, serving as another unifying characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to these findings, there are other DNA-related abnormalities such as <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, mutations in the TET2 gene, and epigenetic phenomena that are associated with and occur across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes the themes unifying this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of diseases </plain></SENT>
