<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here describe two patients who presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> several years after roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> who were found to be severely copper deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous copper repletion resulted in the rapid correction of hematologic indices; combined intravenous and oral copper supplementation and eventual oral copper supplements alone normalized serum copper levels in each patient, but resulted in only partial resolution of the neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report serves to alert physicians of the association between RYGB procedures and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">copper deficiency</z:e> in order to avoid diagnostic delays and to improve treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
