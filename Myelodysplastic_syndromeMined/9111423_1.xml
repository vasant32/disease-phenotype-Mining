<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated 12 patients with an outpatient low-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of Ara-C 100 mg subcutaneously on day 1, and 6-thioguanine 80 mg orally on days 2-5, repeated every week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean peripheral blast count at the beginning of treatment was 29% (4-51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up is 13 months (2-34 months) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and 14 months (2-34 months) for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 12 patients are alive, including seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients with a median of 18 months (range 6-34+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During treatment, the peripheral blast count was markedly reduced to a mean of 5% (0-23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean pre-therapy platelet count, with transfusion support, was 24.0 x 10(9)/l, while the mean post-therapy platelet count without transfusion support is 95.0 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
