<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied if bone marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (ANLL) are altered in their ability to form adherent stromal layer with active haemopoiesis in the Dexter liquid culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells were obtained from 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, 28 patients with ANLL in different stages of the disease and 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no differences between the stromal layers of patients with ANLL in complete remission and those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers after two weeks of cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, bone marrow cells from patients with ANLL before treatment and from patients in relapse formed a poor adherent stromal layer in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 9 cases we found the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal grade of bone marrow cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were qualitative differences in the nonadherent cell population between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ANLL patients in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases we found morphologically recognizable erythroid cells after two-weeks Dexter liquid culture of bone marrow cells from patients with ANLL in complete remission, which were not seen with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could be an indication of harmful effects on the balance of haematopoiesis caused by previous infiltration with leukaemic cells or/and high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
