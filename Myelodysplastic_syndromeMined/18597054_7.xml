<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> was initially administered as a single dose of 5 (n = 6), 10 (n = 7), 20 (n = 6) or 30 (n = 7) mg/(kg day) and then after 7 days seven daily doses were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear PK (C (max) and AUC) were observed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses after a single dose and at steady state, and dose-dependent iron excretion was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were similar to those reported in a Caucasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the single- and multiple-dose phases, 21 of 26 patients progressed to a 3-year extension phase of the study, where dose reductions and increases [5-30 mg/(kg day)] were allowed following safety and efficacy assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the interim, 1-year data show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was well tolerated, with generally infrequent and mild adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in serum ferritin levels were observed and a negative iron balance achieved at doses of 20-30 mg/(kg day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> has a stable and predictable PK/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> profile, irrespective of underlying disease or race, and a predictable and manageable safety profile suitable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration </plain></SENT>
