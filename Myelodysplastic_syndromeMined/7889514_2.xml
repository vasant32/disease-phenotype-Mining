<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the first case of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) demonstrating an association between the appearance of double-minute chromosomes (dmin) and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 59-year-old Japanese woman showed a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 [del(5)(q21q34)] and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 9, when she was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequential cytogenetic analyses demonstrated that the neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood had six copies of dmin, when the disease progressed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cytogenetic change was consistently observed when the patient developed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings in this case suggest that the appearance of dmin may be linked to progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
