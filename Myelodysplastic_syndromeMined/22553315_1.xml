<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The higher resolution offered by recently developed genomic platforms may be used to establish more precise clinical correlations and identify specific target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a series of patients with myeloid disorders using recent genomic technologies (1458 by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays [SNP-A], 226 by next-generation sequencing, and 183 by expression microarrays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using SNP-A, we identified chromosome 7q loss of heterozygosity segments in 161 of 1458 patients (11%); 26% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients harbored 7q <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, of which 41% had a homozygous EZH2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we describe an SNP-A-isolated deletion 7 hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> subset, with a high rate of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using direct and parallel sequencing, we found no recurrent mutations in typically large deletion 7q and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we detected a markedly decreased expression of genes included in our SNP-A defined minimally deleted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although a 2-hit model is present in most patients with 7q <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and a myeloproliferative phenotype, haplodeficient expression of defined regions of 7q may underlie pathogenesis in patients with deletions and predominant dysplastic features </plain></SENT>
