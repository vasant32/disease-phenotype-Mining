<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-referent study was conducted with 330 MDS patients investigated cytogenetically in 1976-1993 (cases) and matched referents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telephone interviews with either the person or a next-of-kin were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participation rate of the cases and referents was 85% and 60%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information was obtained from the next-of-kin more often for the cases (88%) than for the referents (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occupational hygienists assessed the exposure using interview data on worktasks and hobbies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations with disease risk were evaluated for 10 exposures with a logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The investigated exposures were generally not associated with cytogenetically abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effect estimates for specific cytogenetic or morphologic subgroups were generally imprecise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (EMF) was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype [odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-4.0] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The exposure-response association was consistent for intensity but inconclusive for duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A decreased risk was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, irrespective of karyotypic pattern, among farmers and farmhands (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetically abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was generally not associated with occupational or hobby exposure to known or suspected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, exposure prevalences and intensities were low for several agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An association was suggested between occupational exposure to EMF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Biases due to differential information quality and selective participation cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
