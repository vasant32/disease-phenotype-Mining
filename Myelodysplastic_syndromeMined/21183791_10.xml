<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and a strong predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks, cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, and an excess of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, some patients do become clinically stable, and the mechanisms underlying this, other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation, are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have defined a clonal phenotype, termed attenuation, in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 (also known as CHEK1) and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway, and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood, but several of them eventually developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating the cellular DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies in general </plain></SENT>
