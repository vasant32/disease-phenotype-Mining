<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there have been a number of analyses of the prognostic factors, there have been few studies, if any, to determine whether IA affects prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prognosis of 153 MDS patients with or without IA who were treated at a single Japanese institute for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 153 patients (12%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred of 153 patients (63%) had an abnormality in at least one immunological laboratory test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>Hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> was found in 50 of 128 (39%) patients tested, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> was observed in 10 of 128 (8%), positivities of antinuclear antibody, RA factor </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without IA was significantly better than that of patients with IA, and the survival of patients with a CD4/CD8 ratio &gt; 1 was also significantly superior to the survival of those with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio </plain></SENT>
