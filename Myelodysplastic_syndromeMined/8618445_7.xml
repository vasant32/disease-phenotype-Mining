<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at age 47; within 6 months, her sister, age 41, was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proband's father, grandfather and a paternal uncle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, preceded by a pre-leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The five cases had several clinical features in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two sisters and their paternal uncle, cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow cells revealed a common abnormality characterized by loss of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No constitutional cytogenetic abnormality was detected in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no history of common environmental or occupational exposure in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in three generations of this family most likely resulted from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single gene defect</z:e> with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with the somatic loss of 5q material in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells of affected members suggests that a germline mutation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suppressor gene located on 5q might be the primary event responsible for hereditary susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in this family </plain></SENT>
