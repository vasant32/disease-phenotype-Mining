<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Splice gene mutations were detected in 95 of 221 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations were mutually exclusive and less likely to occur in patients with complex cytogenetics or TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SF3B1(mut) patients presented with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, increased WBC and platelet counts, and were more likely to have DNMT3A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SRSF2(mut) patients clustered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> subtypes and exhibited pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZRSR2(mut) patients clustered in International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups, had higher percentages of bone marrow blasts, and more often displayed isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 and ZRSR2 mutations were more common in TET2(mut) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>U2AF35(mut) patients had an increased prevalence of chromosome 20 deletions and ASXL1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed an inferior overall survival and a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation rate for the genotype ZRSR2(mut)/TET2(wt) (overall survival: hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.7; P = .006; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation: hazard ratio = 3.6; 95% CI, 2-4.2; P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that splice gene mutations are among the most frequent molecular aberrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, define distinct clinical phenotypes, and show preferential associations with mutations targeting transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
