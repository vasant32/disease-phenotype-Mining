<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found that FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> elevation under translation-inhibiting stimuli was significantly smaller in granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to clarify the cause of the impaired FOS induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first examined the mechanisms of FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> elevation using granulocytes from healthy donors cultured with the translation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">Emetine</z:chebi> increased both transcription and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability of FOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p38 MAPK inhibition abolished the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>-induced increase of FOS transcription but did not affect FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein HuR to FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> containing an ARE in 3'UTR was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>, and the knockdown of HuR reduced the FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stabilizing effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We next compared the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>-induced transcription and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stabilization of FOS between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased rates of FOS transcription by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> were similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>, however, 76.7±19.8% of FOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> remained after 45 min in healthy controls, versus 37.9±25.5% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
