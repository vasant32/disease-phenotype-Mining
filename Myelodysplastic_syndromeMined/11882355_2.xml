<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether granulocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) are more or less intrinsically sensitive to spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than granulocytes from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has been suggested as an explanation for the proliferation or selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood granulocytes from five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and five healthy volunteers were cultured in the absence of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the granulocytes was assessed every 6 hours by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of CD16b, CD95, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor also were studied by flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activity was measured by fluorometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the proportion or absolute numbers of apoptotic and apoptotic/dead granulocytes between the cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and healthy individuals, whereas those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed significantly lower frequencies of apoptotic granulocytes compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD16b(-) granulocytes was not significantly different among the three groups during in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD95 and GM-CSF receptor was not significantly increased in cultured granulocytes or noncultured granulocytes from, respectively, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 activity significantly decreased in cultured granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but not in granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients did not display a reduced sensitivity to spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of blood cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> may not be an important factor in proliferation or selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are in agreement with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lifespan of granulocytes in vivo </plain></SENT>
