<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To enhance the conditioning regimen's antileukemic effect, we decided to supplant Flu with clofarabine (Clo), and assayed the interactions of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs alone and in combination with Bu in Bu-resistant human cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found pronounced synergy between each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> and the alkylator but even more enhanced cytotoxic synergy when the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs were combined prior to exposing the cells to Bu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then designed a 4-arm clinical trial in patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were adaptively randomized as follows: Arm I-Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m(2), Arm II-20:20 mg/m(2), Arm III-30:10 mg/m(2), and Arm IV-single-agent Clo at 40 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analog(s) were/was infused over 1 hour once daily for 4 days, followed on each day by Bu, infused over 3 hours to a pharmacokinetically targeted daily area under the curve (AUC) of 6000 μMol-min ± 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients have been enrolled with a minimum follow-up exceeding 100 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 32 males and 19 females, with a median age of 45 years (range: 6-59) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 42 AML patients and 5 of 9 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients are alive with a projected median overall survival (OS) of 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Marrow and blood (T cell) chimerism studies at day +100 revealed that both in the lower-dose Clo groups (groups 1+2) and the higher-dose Clo groups (groups 3+4), the patients had a median of 100% donor (T cell)-derived DNA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Bu as pretransplant conditioning is safe in high-risk myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients; (2) clofarabine is sufficiently immunosuppressive to support allo-SCT in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; and (3) the median OS of 23 months in this high-risk patient population is encouraging </plain></SENT>
