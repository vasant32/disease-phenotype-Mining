<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to define the clinical relevance of the bcl-2 mRNA expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and its correlation to therapy outcome and prognosis, we analyzed 219 AML bone marrow (BM) samples, including 119 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at presentation, 37 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), as well as 42 BM samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in relapse and 21 in complete remission (CR) using RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For performing quantitative measurements of bcl-2 mRNA, we developed a quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bcl-2 mRNA was detectable in 133 of 156 (84%) patients at diagnosis and 40 of 42 (95%) at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with high bcl-2 mRNA expression achieved lower CR rates than those with no or low expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning the long-term outcome, the overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly worse in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with high expression levels of bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three-year OS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients was 49% and 10% (P = 0.028), respectively, and 71% and 15% (P = 0.0004) for patients &lt; 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparable significant differences were observed for the DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and patients &gt; 60 years, the bcl-2 expression was not associated with remission rate or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bcl-2 mRNA may serve as a prognostic factor predicting remission outcome and long-term prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
