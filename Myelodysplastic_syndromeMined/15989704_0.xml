<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), we conducted HDCT with ASCT using a drug-only protocol without total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously untreated and treated adult patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were enrolled onto this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the HDCT protocol, we developed the AECC regimen, a drug-only regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and nimustine (ie, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7576">ACNU</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were used mainly as a source for ASCT and were used based on collection rates of CD34 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled and assessed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median length of follow-up was 6.5 years, with a range of 0.2-12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective immunophenotypic examination indicated that the majority of the patients were diagnosed with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before HDCT, 37 patients still had disease (26 partial responses [PRs] and 11 cases of no response), and 19 patients exhibited a complete response (CR) before HDCT with ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 56 patients, 37 (66%) exhibited a CR, including patients continuing their first CR and those experiencing a second or further CR, and 11 patients (19.6%) exhibited PR on HDCT with ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of patients without CR were significantly poorer than those of the patients with CR, and 7-year overall survival rates of patients with and without CR were 63% and 27.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT is one of the available consolidation therapies for aggressive NHL, and additional involved-field irradiation could play a role in the management of patients with NHL who do not exhibit a CR after treatment with HDCT containing a drug-only program </plain></SENT>
