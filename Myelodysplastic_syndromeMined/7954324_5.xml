<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of 17p resulted from partial arm deletion (eight cases), unbalanced translocation (12 cases), i(17)(q10)(five cases) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three cases, both 17ps were missing; in one case, two sublines independently acquired loss of 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight cases, loss of 17p was confirmed as a secondary change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes generally were complex, with an average of 4.0 structurally abnormal chromosomes in the simplest lines showing 17p loss </plain></SENT>
