<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in DNMT3A were identified in 22.1% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the frequency and clinical impact of DNMT3A mutations in a cohort of 193 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in DNMT3A were found in 2.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of mutations were heterozygous missense mutations affecting codon R882 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with DNMT3A mutations were found to have a higher rate of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When assessing the global methylation levels in patients with mutated versus unmutated DNMT3A and healthy controls no difference in global DNA methylation levels between the two groups was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, DNMT3A mutations occur at a low frequency and may be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
