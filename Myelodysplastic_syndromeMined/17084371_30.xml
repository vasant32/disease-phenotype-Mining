<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less-intensive regimens should be associated with a lower release of inflammatory cytokines and possibly less GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate whether HLA-haploidentical SCT can be performed using nonmyeloablative conditioning and pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using conditioning consisting of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin and GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/day), 26 patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> in an advanced stage or with a poor prognosis underwent transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA-haploidentical donor (2-3 antigen mismatches in the graft-versus-host [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>] direction) without T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rapid hematologic engraftment was achieved (neutrophils &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L on day 12 and platelets &gt; 20 x 10(9)/L on day 12), with full donor chimerism achieved by day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD clinically, and only 5 patients developed grade II GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recovery of CD4+ T cells was delayed compared with that of CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 26 patients are alive in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four died of transplantation-related causes, and 6 died of progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and early therapeutic intervention for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> reaction allow stable engraftment and effectively suppress GVHD in HLA 2-3 antigen-mismatched SCT </plain></SENT>
