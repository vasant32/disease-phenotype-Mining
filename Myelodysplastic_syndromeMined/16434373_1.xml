<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Detecting differences in the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) between a recipient and a donor has already been used to monitor the degree of chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alongside major histocompatibility complex disparity, the disparity of various polymorphous proteins encoded by several genes may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) in allogenic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the biological effect of VNTR disparity has scarcely been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Eighty-four patients receiving an SCT from an HLA-identical sibling (n=68) or an unrelated donor (n=16) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were transplanted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (ns=48), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n=8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=15), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=18) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to amplify three VNTR regions (D1S80, D1S111, and D17S5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These regions were classified as fully matched, partially matched, or mismatched between donors recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A strong correlation was observed between D1S80 matching status and transplant outcomes in terms of overall survival (p=0.0179) and non-relapse mortality (p=0.0305), but not for the D1S111 or D17S5 disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fully matched D1S80 pairs showed a better overall survival (72% vs 38%) and lower non-relapse mortality (17% vs 50%) compared to the partially matched or mismatched pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, a fully matched D1S80 pair was found to be an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (p=0.03) and non-relapse mortality (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, D1S80 disparity was significantly associated with the occurrence of gut <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that disparities in D1S80--located in chromosome 1--are associated with an increased incidence of gut <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and non-relapse mortality </plain></SENT>
