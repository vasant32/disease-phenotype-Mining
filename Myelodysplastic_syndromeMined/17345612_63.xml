<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This provided the first opportunity to examine the incidence and survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the United States using a large, population-based database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SEER 17 regions public-use database (November 2005 submission) was accessed to obtain data on the frequency, incidence, and survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Geographic areas were selected for inclusion in the SEER Program based on their ability to operate and maintain a high-quality, population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> reporting system and for their epidemiologically significant population subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SEER data from 2001 through 2003 indicated that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increased with age, and approximately 86% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were diagnosed in individuals aged &gt; or =60 years (median age at diagnosis = 76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men had a significantly higher incidence rate than women (4.5 vs 2.7 per 100,000 per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among racial groups, white individuals had the highest incidence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2003, approximately 10,300 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were diagnosed in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was poor, with an observed 3-year survival rate of only 35% (5-year survival data were not available at the time of the current report) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male patients and patients who were diagnosed at an older age had significantly worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> survival also varied by clinical subtype, and the survival of patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> was somewhat worse than reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The availability of descriptive epidemiologic data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be used now to facilitate much needed research on the etiology and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that &gt;10,000 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are diagnosed annually in the United States, and the survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The availability of descriptive epidemiologic data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be used now to facilitate much needed research on the etiology and outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
