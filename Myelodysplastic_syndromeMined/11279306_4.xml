<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferases (GST) detoxify various agents, including those implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) genes have "null" alleles and are polymorphic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the impact of GTM(1) and GSTT(1) null genotypes on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> susceptibility, disease severity and laboratory indices with prognostic value for the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study we analyzed lymphocyte DNA samples from 54 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 60 cancer-free controls matched for age, sex, smoking habits and origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype both GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chi(2) test was used for statistical evaluation of the data and the odds ratios and attributable risk and population attributable risk were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly increased frequency of GSTM(1) null genotype was found among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (57.4%) compared to controls (33.3%) (p &lt; 0.01), while the frequency of GSTT(1) null genotype was not significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (11.1% vs. 6.66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) null genotype was associated with a particular category of the French-American-British (FAB) classification in the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, GSTM(1) null genotype was associated with a significant decrease in the absolute number of neutrophils among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GSTM(1) null genotype may have increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Null genotypes do not seem to have be associated with FAB classification while they may be associated with putative prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
