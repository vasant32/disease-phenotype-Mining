<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of some studies suggest the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> gene (WT1) as a possible molecular marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured the expression of WT1 at diagnosis and during treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of WT1 was measured by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR in peripheral leukocytes from 56 AML at diagnosis and 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The WT1 expression was significantly elevated (up to 3 orders of magnitude) in peripheral blood samples (PB) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients at diagnosis compared to PB samples of healthy donors (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of WT1 expression depends particularly on FAB <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtype, with the highest being found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with subtypes M4, M1, M3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with M2 and with the presence of AML1/ET0 at presentation showed a significantly lower expression of the WT1 gene compared to the remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients at presentation (P = 0,005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, sequence samples of 12 AML patients under long-term surveillance were tested for the WT1 expression in parallel with the expression of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> markers--fusion genes: AMLI/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>, PML/RARalpha and CBFB/MYH11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of WT1 gene expression and the above specific fusion genes significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 14 patients without the specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> marker were tested for the WT1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show that haematological relapses were associated with the rise of expression of the specific fusion genes and with the WT1 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rise of WT1 expression above the level seen in leucocytes from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow of healthy donors--in four patients under long-term surveillance the "molecular relapse" predicted ongoing haematological relapses as early as 2 months in advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results, in accordance with some of the previously published ones, show that WT1 expression seems to be a suitable marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
