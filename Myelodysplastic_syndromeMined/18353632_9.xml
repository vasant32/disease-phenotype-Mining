<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 237 patients with ESFT treated at our institution from September 1979 through to February 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence (CI) of SM by the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and treatment was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients with SM were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (SL) developed in 8 patients (2 ALL, 6 MDS/AML), a median 2.6 years (range 1.4-19.6 years) after diagnosis of ESFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, a median 8.0 years (range 7.4-9.4 years) after the ESFT diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five- and 10-year estimates of the CI of SM were 3.0+/-1.1% and 4.7+/-1.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated on recent protocols with higher cumulative doses or an increased dose intensity of alkylators and epipodophyllotoxins and the use of G-CSF had a higher estimated CI of SL than those in earlier studies (5-year CI 6.4+/-2.4% versus 0.0+/-0.0%, respectively, P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESFT are at risk for SM after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of SM is higher with the current treatment protocols and may be related to the intensification of chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
