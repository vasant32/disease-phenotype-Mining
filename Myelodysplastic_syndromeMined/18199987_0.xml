<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) constitutes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia(s), in the presence of hypercellular bone marrow with features of ineffective hematopoiesis, and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the precise pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains to be clarified, cytogenetic abnormalities seem to be involved in its pathogenesis and are considered as an important factor in diagnosis and predicting clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the cytogenetic features of Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed in 88 MDS patients and among them, 34 cases were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) with precisely chromosome 8 centromere specific DNA probe and DNA specific probes for 7q32 , 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 45 (51.1%) showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities by CC at diagnosis, including numerical changes (18 cases, 20.5%), structural changes (12 cases, 13.6%), and numerical and structural changes simultaneously(15 cases, 17.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8, -5/5q-, and -7/ 7q- account for 20.5%, 15.9%, and 5.7% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotypes were observed in 17 patients, the incidence being 19.3% in the whole series of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 34 MDS patients studied by I-FISH, -5/5q-, -7/7q- and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 occurring in 4, 2 and 10 cases respectively for CC were confirmed by I-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 cases in 30 cases who did not show -5/5q- by CC displayed this abnormality by I-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 cases without -7/7q- by CC presented this aberration by I-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 for I-FISH was not identified this change by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequent abnormalities are <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, -5/5q- and -7/ 7q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FISH is very useful in detecting these alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and it is an important complement to CC </plain></SENT>
