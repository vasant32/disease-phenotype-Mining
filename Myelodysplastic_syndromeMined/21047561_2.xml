<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 23-70 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> treated with a uniform RIC regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation (200 cGy) with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73% for patients with indolent NHL, 58% for those with aggressive NHL, 67% for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, 30% for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, and only 10% for those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0%, 32%, 50%, 33%, and 38%, and those for progression-free survival were 73%, 45%, 27%, 27%, and 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14% at day +100 and 22% at 1 year </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed superior overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with both indolent and aggressive NHL compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality was observed in patients with a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score â‰¥ 3 and in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (1) RIC conditioning was well tolerated by an older, heavily pretreated population; (2) patients with indolent and aggressive NHL respond well to RIC conditioning, highlighting the importance of the graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect; and (3) additional peri-transplantation manipulations are needed to improve outcomes for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> receiving RIC conditioning before HCT </plain></SENT>
