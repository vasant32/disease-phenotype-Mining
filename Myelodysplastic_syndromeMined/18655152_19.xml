<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies indicate that diverse biological properties can be attributed to this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> is still unclear but it is thought that overall EVI1 can act mostly as a transcription repressor through its interaction with a subset of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors have however indicated that EVI1-mediated repression can be only partially rescued by deacetylase inhibitor drugs, suggesting that additional chromosomal modifications might occur to induce gene repression by EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation contributes to the repressive potential of EVI1, we examined a potential association between EVI1, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6824">HMT</z:chebi>) SUV39H1, and methyltransferase activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that EVI1 directly interacts with SUV39H1 and that the proteins form an active complex with methyltransferase activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that SUV39H1 enhances the transcription repressive potential of EVI1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that EVI1 affects promoters' activity in two different pathways, by association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases and by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to impose a heterochromatin-like structure establishing a lasting transcription repression </plain></SENT>
