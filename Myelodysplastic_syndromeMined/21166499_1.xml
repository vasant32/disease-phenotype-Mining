<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) may stimulate the immune system and improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of administering IL-2 following a T-cell-depleted nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received T-cell-depleted nonmyeloablative transplant from a matched or mismatched related donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with allogeneic engraftment, &lt;grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at time of study entry, and no severe end organ damage were eligible and received IL-2 starting 6 weeks after the first day of stem cell infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received 1 mu/m2 daily for 5 days each week for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period for a 6-week cycle to continue for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients aged 28-69 years were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant toxicities were limited to GVHD of the skin â‰¤grade 2 in 3 patients and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in 4 patients, limiting the duration of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the 8 patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> and 1 from CMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median overall duration of follow-up of survivors of 48 months, 5 patients (63%) remain alive and in continuous complete remission </plain></SENT>
