<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although pharmacokinetic data with IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> suggests equivalence, there are no efficacy data published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) FAB subtypes were enrolled and received 75 mg/m(2)/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> by 20-min intravenous infusion for 5 days in every 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global methylation studies were performed at baseline and prior to Cycle 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were enrolled and 22 were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 69.5 years; 9 (41%) patients had lower-risk disease (IPSS Low or Int-1) and 13 (59%) had higher-risk disease (IPSS Int-2 or High) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent of patients responded (5 CRs and 1 PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 108 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 339 days (11.3 months), the median OS was 444 days (14.8 months) and the median duration of response (DOR) was 450 days (15.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Global methylation studies suggest a greater degree of demethylation in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This regimen appeared to offer a PR + CR rate and median DOR somewhat similar to what has been reported with the 7-day subcutaneous regimen; however, OS was shorter </plain></SENT>
