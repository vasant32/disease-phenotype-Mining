<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 16 patients (females/males:6/10; mean age: 61.68 +/- 13.08 years) diagnosed with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>" according to FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sister chromatid exchange frequency in the study group was found to be significantly higher than the control group (8.3 +/- 11 vs. 6.83 +/- 1.07, P=0.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that increased DNA damage, which is revealed by the increased sister chromatid exchange in the present study may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
