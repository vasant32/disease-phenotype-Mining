<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the long-term outcome and toxicities in 98 patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) who were treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and monitored for a median observation period of 11.67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1983 and 1994, 98 patients in our institution in first or second and higher complete remission (CR) underwent total body irradiation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> prior to ABMT purged with mafosfamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven out of the 90 evaluable patients (30%) were alive and in continuous CR for a median of 11.67 years (range, 6.39-15.53) after ABMT and could be considered as 'cured' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 90 patients, 39 were transplanted at first CR and had a significantly higher survival rate than those transplanted at &gt; or = 2 CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Younger patients (&lt;40 years) had a better prognosis and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026998" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M1</z:e>-4 had a more favorable outcome than those with M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term complications included four patients with cardiac complications, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five developed HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> among the long-term survivors was 44.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a significant number of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first CR derived long-term benefit from ABMT, despite the risks of a few long-term complications and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
