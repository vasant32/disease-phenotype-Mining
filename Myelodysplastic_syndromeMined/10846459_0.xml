<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher incidence of preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also had a significantly higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (loss or partial deletion of chromosome 5 or 7) and a significantly lower incidence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(15:17), t(8:21), or inv(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to FAB subtypes in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the incidence of M3 subtype was significantly lower in the elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase positivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells in the elderly group was lower than that in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data at presentation disclosed a lower peripheral leukemic cell count, a higher fibrinogen level, a lower serum protein level, and a higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level in the elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also had poorer performance status and more frequent concomitant diseases at presentation, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, or documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients 60 years or older had a higher incidence of poor prognostic factors compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
