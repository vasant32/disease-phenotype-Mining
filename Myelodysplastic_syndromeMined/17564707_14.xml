<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this study, pharmacokinetics (PK) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> administered as a 3-h intravenous infusion of 15 mg/m2 every 8 h for 3 days (cycles repeated every 6 weeks) was evaluated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PK of this dosing regimen was evaluated in sixteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were obtained pre-dose and during the first 8-h dosing interval on each dosing day during Cycle 1, and at pre-dose and just prior to the end of infusion during Cycle 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PK samples were assayed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> by a sensitive and specific validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), 64.8-77.0 ng/ml, and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity), 152-163 ng h/ml, were unchanged during dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time to the maximum concentration (Tmax) generally occurred at the end of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values for terminal phase elimination half-life (0.62-0.78 h), total body clearance (125-132 l/h per m2), and volume of distribution at steady state (62.7-89.2 l/m2), remained unchanged during the every 8 h dosing (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cycles 1 and 2 Cmax values for days 1, 2, and 3 were not significantly different as determined by paired two-tailed t test (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, which was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, were considered possibly related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> dosed at 15 mg/m2 iv every 8 h for 3 days resulted in a predictable and manageable toxicity profile in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The repeated dosing did not result in systemic accumulation of the drug, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> PK remained unchanged from cycle to cycle </plain></SENT>
