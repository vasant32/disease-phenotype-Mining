<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two sisters are reported, both with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) associated with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was also present in one of them, who later developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) of the M0 FAB-type and died, whereas the other died with no evolution into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides FISH studies, microsatellite analysis was performed on both sisters to gather information on the parental origin of the chromosome 7 involved in partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> and of the extra chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes 7 involved were of different parental origin in the two sisters, thus confirming that familial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 is not explained by a germ-line mutation of a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in two other families out of the 12 reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy is the association with a mendelian disease in 3 out of 12 <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 families, which suggest that a mutator gene, capable of inducing both karyotype instability and a mendelian disorder, might act to induce chromosome 7 anomalies in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We postulate that, in fact, an inherited mutation in any of a group of mutator genes causes familial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 also in the absence of a recognized mendelian disease, and that marrow chromosome 7 anomalies, in turn, lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
