<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>52 patients (30 male, 22 female) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria</z:e> (PCH) were identified by critically examining the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with Donath-Landsteiner antibodies seen over a 37 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although ages ranged from 1-82 years, PCH was much commoner in young children; the median age at presentation was 5 and the peak incidence, 0.4 per year per 100,000 of the population at risk, was in the 4 years and under group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>44 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transient PCH, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-syphilitic PCH and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> syphilitic PCH; 4, in whom the positive Donath-Landsteiner tests were incidental findings, could not be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> PCH typically presented in young children as sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of malaise, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019048" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemoglobinuria</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, often associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> - <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients who were 13 or younger had this type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was usually a history of a recent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, most commonly of the upper respiratory tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PCH had no obvious relation to exposure to cold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dramatic and rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level were common, often accompanied initially by relative or absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The illness was severe, but the prognosis was generally good and the majority of patients had completely recovered within one month, some requiring no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In approximately 68% of patients, blood transfusion was needed; the P blood group was not taken into account, but the patients were kept warm throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steroids (usually <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) were given in many cases; but since there was no evidence to support their benefit, it was recommended that they were stopped as soon as the diagnosis was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> non-syphilitic PCH was much rarer; the patients had a characteristic presentation of severe systemic symptoms (paroxysms) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019048" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemoglobinuria</z:e> brought on by exposure to cold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations varied in intensity between individuals; at the extreme, severe debility was experienced over many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Warmth and avoidance of cold were an effective treatment, though in a severely afflicted patient, an attack could be precipitated by relatively little exposure to cold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> syphilitic PCH there was the added need to treat the specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The direct antiglobulin test was almost always positive (50 out of 51 cases tested), with C3d coating the red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The Donath-Landsteiner antibodies were of IgG class, but this was rarely demonstrated unless direct antiglobulin tests were carried out at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The antibodies showed the classical anti-P specificity in 27 of the 30 patients tested; other specificities were unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although acting much better as haemolysins, Donath-Landsteiner antibodies could also cause weak agglutination at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled in vivo by predominantly intravascular haemolysis with an extravascular component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was usually easy when PCH was suspected, though in some patients Donath-Landsteiner tests did not become positive until more sensitive techniques involving papainised red cells or two-stage procedures were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the association in some cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e> and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In one patient, an aetiological relationship was confirmed by a saline extract of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue behaving as a strong Donath-Landsteiner antibody with the same anti-P specificity as the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>4 patients had other types of autoimmune haemolysis concomitant with, but distinct from, the PCH; in 3 cases this was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cold haemagglutinin disease</z:e> and in one it was warm type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
