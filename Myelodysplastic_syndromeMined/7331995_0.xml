<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes were analyzed from 14 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> who had marrow samples processed directly and cultured in various ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) (seven patients) or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndrome</z:e> (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients were known to have an abnormal karyotype, and in each case, two samples of a bone marrow aspirate were available: one processed directly and another cultured for 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the 11 patients had essentially the same proportion of abnormal cells in the direct and 24-hr samples; in five other patients, the percentage of aneuploid cells in the sample cultured for 24 hr was higher than that in the direct preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of aneuploid cells was observed in the direct preparation in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three other cases of ANLL, a marrow aspirate was cultured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in addition to samples processed directly and after 24-hr culture; only two of these had an abnormal clone in any sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of karyotype analysis differed in these two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of aneuploid cells was substantially higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> culture than in the 24-hr culture in one patient; in the other patient, the 24-hr culture contained aneuploid cells, whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> culture showed none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the 13 aneuploid patients would have been incorrectly classified as being karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the basis of the initial analysis of the direct preparation, since only a single abnormal cell was detected in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The karyotypic pattern in untreated patients with ANLL has prognostic significance; therefore, the method of processing marrow aspirates may substantially influence the degree of correlation between the karyotype and survival reported by different laboratories </plain></SENT>
