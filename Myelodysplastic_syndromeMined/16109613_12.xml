<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the oncohematological setting, it has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoid, and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, increased circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these premises we analysed total and activated CECs, and endothelial precursors (CEPs) in 50 MDS patients and 20 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CECs and CEPs were quantified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEC levels were compared with bone marrow (BM) microvessel density (MVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, some angiogenic factors, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and soluble VEGF-Receptor2 (VEGFR2), were tested in the sera from 25 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total, activated CECs and CEPs were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when compared to control group (p&lt;0.0001); whereas in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases no association was found with French--American--British (FAB), International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) subtypes or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher CECs also showed higher MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the cytokines analysed, sVEGFR2 was significantly higher in the lower IPSS risk classes, while the levels of bFGF directly correlated with total and activated CECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together these data strengthen the hypothesis of a possible role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
