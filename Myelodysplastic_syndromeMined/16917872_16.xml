<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human multidrug resistance gene MDR1 encodes the protein product P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P-gp is an integral membrane protein which mediates ATP-dependent substrate efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently discovered a novel G --&gt; T variant at 1199 nucleotide position of MDR1 which exhibits a 2.3% allelic frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional effects of this MDR1-G1199T variant were evaluated with recombinant HEK cells that stably express the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, G1199A, or G1199T variant of the MDR1 protein, P-gp, at comparable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of cytotoxic P-gp substrates comprising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, vinblastine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, paclitaxel, or topotecan (a poor P-gp substrate) was used to evaluate the functional impact of G1199 variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to MDR1(wt), MDR1(G1199A) exhibited an increased resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, paclitaxel, vinblastine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MDR1(G1199T) reduced resistance to (1/4) that of MDR1(wt) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drugs except topotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of MDR1 exhibits some degree of resistance to topotecan, but 1199 variation has no impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data were consistent with the variation in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> concentrations measured in MDR1 recombinant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with the novel MDR1-G1199T variant may exhibit a lower degree of MDR1 dependent chemoresistance, and those with the G1199A polymorphism may exhibit a higher degree of resistance, compared with MDR1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
