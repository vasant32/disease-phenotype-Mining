<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We modified the combination by adding single-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and lowered the total dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> to 35 mg/m2 (5 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 6, and then 10 mg/m2 on days 11 and 18) and then to 20 mg/m2 (5 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, 6, and 11) in an attempt to decrease these side effects in two sequential consecutive groups of patients </plain></SENT>
