<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of EMT is still unclear, although the appearance of trilineage EMT is often considered to affect the outcome adversely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old lady with previous history of intestinal resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 1995 and subsequently treated with 5-fuorouracyl developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, a progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During chemotherapy for this condition, slight enlargement of left supraclavicular and right submandibular nodes was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle biopsy was performed with ancillary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of trilineage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">extramedullary myeloid tumor</z:e> was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with low doses of chemotherapy with a good response lasting 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The peculiar cytologic picture of this condition when corroborated by ancillary studies (immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry) is diagnostic of this rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">extramedullary myeloid tumor</z:e> in this case did not significantly affect the response to the chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t </plain></SENT>
