<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether adding the multidrug resistance gene-1 (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1) modulator valspodar (PSC 833; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Hanover, NJ) to chemotherapy provided clinical benefit to patients with poor-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase III randomized study was performed using valspodar plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (PSC-MEC; n=66) versus MEC (n=63) to treat patients with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the PSC-MEC versus MEC arms, complete response (CR) was achieved in 17% versus 25% of patients, respectively (P=not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients who had not received prior intensive chemotherapy (ie, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the CR rate was increased--35% versus 15% for the remaining patients (P=.018); CR rates did not differ between treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival in those achieving CR was similar in the two arms (10 versus 9.3 months) as was the patients' overall survival (4.6 versus 5.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CR rates in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>+ (69% of patients) versus <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>- patients were similar for those receiving either chemotherapy regimen (16% versus 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CR rate for unfavorable cytogenetic patients (45% of patients) was 13% compared to the remainder, 28% (P=.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the clearances of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> were decreased by 59% and 50%, respectively, supporting the empiric dose reductions in the PSC-MEC arm designed in anticipation of drug interactions between valspodar and the chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CR rates and overall survival were not improved by using PSC-MEC compared to MEC chemotherapy alone in patients with poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
