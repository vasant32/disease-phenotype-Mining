<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results are based on monitoring of 120 patients, who were followed for at least 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) revealed that mixed chimerism was practically absent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and relatively long-lasting in ALL and AA (regardless to substantially different post-transplantation treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first disease relapses signalized by molecular checking of mixed peripheral chimerism were observed also after a period of remission lasting for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular watching enables us to detect relapses at their very beginning that would remain hidden to less sensitive methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the transplanted patients ought to be monitored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> i.e. cellular chimerism using molecular methods without time limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand low level of mixed cellular chimerism is not necessarily a sign of disease progression and can remain unchanged as "status quo" for a very long period </plain></SENT>
