<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study assessed the transplant outcomes of 29 consecutive patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (83%) or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (17%) treated with allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 51 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donors were mostly matched unrelated (52%), and 59% of patients received myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-year overall survival, event-free survival and relapse incidence were 37%, 34% and 33%; NRM was 17% at 100 days, and 32% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was reduced in patients with high-risk cytogenetics (p = 0.02), Karnofsky performance status ≤ 80% (p = 0.001) and disease after induction ± consolidation (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NRM was higher in patients receiving &gt; 2 therapy lines for previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (p = 0.01) and in those allografted &gt; 6 months from diagnosis (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, allogeneic transplantation should be proposed timely to these patients after an accurate analysis of patient history </plain></SENT>
