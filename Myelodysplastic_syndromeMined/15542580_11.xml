<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma thrombopoietin and glycocalicin index (a parameter of platelet or megakaryocyte destruction) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean platelet life (MPL), corrected for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, was reduced in 15 of 30 patients (4.3 +/- 0.9 days [mean +/- SD] vs 6.0 +/- 1.3, P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet production rate (PPR) was reduced in 25 of 30 patients (68 +/- 34 x 10(9)/d vs 220 +/- 65, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin levels were not significantly correlated with the PPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the glycocalicin index was significantly higher compared with controls (15 +/- 16 vs 0.7 +/- 0.2, P = .001) and significantly correlated with the PPR (P = .02, r = -0.5), but not with the MPL (P = 1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-like programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) in mature and immature megakaryocytes (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of the bone marrow biopsies demonstrated no positive staining of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> megakaryocytes for activated caspase-3 (n = 24) or cathepsin D (n = 21), while activated caspase-8 was demonstrated in a subgroup of patients (5/21) in less than 10% of megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is caspase-3-independent <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-like PCD resulting in a decreased PPR in conjunction with an increased glycocalicin index </plain></SENT>
