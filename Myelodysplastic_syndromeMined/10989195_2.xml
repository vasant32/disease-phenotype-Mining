<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to protocol therapy, BM stroma was cultivated and selected CD34(+) cells were studied in stroma and cytokine-dependent clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TUNEL assay was used to establish the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurring in the marrow and CD34(+) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of oral ciproloxacin 500 mg b. i.d., pentoxifylline 800 mg t.i.d., and dexamathasone 4 mg t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(CPD) antiinflammatory therapy was correlated with the intensity of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation of BM progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (10 transfusion dependent) received therapy for a median of 99 days (range 49-284) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity caused four patients to discontinue the drug combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients fulfilled response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients became transfusion independent, and 50% reduction in the need for blood transfusions was noted in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood parameters of one untransfused patient increased by &gt;30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blood count remained unsupported in three patients, even at a median of 12 months after trial discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of marrow cells and selected CD34(+) progenitors was detected in a median of 49.5% (range 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>6%-90%) and 10.6% (range 3.6%-100%; p &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients who responded to therapy, the median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate in the bone marrow population was 71%, in contrast to the nonresponder's rate of 13% (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall clonogenic growth of selected precursors corresponded significantly with response to CPD protocol (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, ineffective hematopoiesis is related to high apoptotic index despite proliferation of the CD34(+) precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These patients seem to benefit from CPD cytokine modulatory therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
