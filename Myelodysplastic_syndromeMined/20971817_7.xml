<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Registry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hematologic Malignancies</z:e> of the CÃ´te d'Or Department in France has, however, steadfastly registered data on cases occurring in the Department since 1980, resulting, to date, in a database of over 5,000 cases classified according to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-O-3 classification, following the most recent World Health Organization classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five years of data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>World population standardized incidence rates were calculated as were as observed and relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants/year were 2.5 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 1.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 3.2 for myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and 0.6 for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that the incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> increased significantly over the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival is 8.9 months for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 33.8 months for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 91.7 months for those with myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and 26.6 months for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Observed and relative 20-year survival rates are, respectively, 12% and 13% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 2% and 6% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 20% and 34% in myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These population-based data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> are the first data collected over such a long period and provide interesting information for clinicians and public health authorities, particularly given the paucity of other long-term, population-based data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
