<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce the contamination by nonproliferating peripheral blood cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspirates were submitted to a density centrifugation step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA content measurements were performed with a PHYWEICP 22 flow system apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cells in te cell cycle phases was calculated by means of an automated fitting procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between the cell cycle distribution in ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e> was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relationship was observed between the size of the S phase compartment and the percentage of blasts in the original samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirates from ANLL were also cultured in vitro in liquid phase on dialysis membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clear relationship was observed between the size of the phase compartment and in vitro cell growth since, with the exception of one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples with less than 11% cells in S phase failed to proliferate in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation profile of ANLL cells after 10 days in culture was similar to that of the original samples </plain></SENT>
