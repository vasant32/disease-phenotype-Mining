<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, basophilia, transfusion dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and rapidly progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classical chromosome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a reciprocal t(3;5)(q26;q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) probes, the breakpoint on chromosome 3 was localized to the butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene (3q26.1-q26.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene has recently been implicated in the regulation of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether the BCHE gene was also involved in the deregulation of myelopoiesis, causing the unusual clinical picture in this case, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
