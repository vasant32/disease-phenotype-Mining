<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 60 (68%) patients were followed up to the time of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival was 66 months; leukemic transformation was documented in five (5.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified age &gt;or=70 years (P=0.01), transfusion need at diagnosis (P=0.04) and dysgranulopoiesis (P=0.02) as independent predictors of shortened survival; the presence of zero (low risk), one (intermediate risk) or &gt;or=2 (high risk) risk factors corresponded to median survivals of 102, 52 and 27 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutational analysis was performed on archived bone marrows in 78 patients; JAK2V617F and MPLW515L mutations were shown in five (6.4%) and three (3.8%) patients, respectively, and did not seem to affect phenotype or prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IDH mutations were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was not affected by serum ferritin and there were no instances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> directly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current study is unique in its strict adherence to WHO criteria for selecting study patients and providing information on long-term survival, practical prognostic factors, baseline risk of leukemic transformation and the prevalence of JAK2, MPL and IDH mutations </plain></SENT>
