<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced bone marrow (BM) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is regarded as an essential cofactor in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and microvessel formation may be induced by TNF-alpha as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate TNF-alpha signaling and neoangiogenesis as potential molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with respect to the various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes, we performed a morphological and clinico-pathological study on a large series of paraffin-embedded trephine BM biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNF-alpha expression and BM vessels were immunohistochemically analyzed on 89 paraffin-embedded BM biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, including 12 control samples </plain></SENT>
