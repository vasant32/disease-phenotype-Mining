<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, differentiating acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) from hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (hypo RA) can be a difficult and challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological, cytochemical, immunocytochemical, and cytogenetic studies may provide tools for discriminating between both entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, differences in the pattern of proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of bone marrow cells in AA and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the correlation between p53 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we examined the overexpression of p53 on bone marrow biopsies in RA and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study included 14 patients with hypo RA, 14 patients with hypercellular (hyper) RA, ten patients with classic acquired AA, and 37 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p53 was overexpressed in eight (57%) hypo RA patients and 11 (79%) hyper RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and patients with AA showed no overexpression of p53 in their marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were statistically significant:p &lt; 0.01 (AA vs hypo RA), p&lt;0.001 (AA vs hyper RA), while the difference between hypo RA and hyper RA was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that p53 overexpression in bone marrow biopsies is a valuable tool for studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and may provide additional information to help differentiate hypo RA from acquired AA </plain></SENT>
