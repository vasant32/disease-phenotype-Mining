<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only five parameters were significant by both survival curves and multiple regression analyses: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, bone marrow (BM) cellularity (estimated from trephine BM biopsies), BM blast percentage, age and BM erythro/myeloid (E/M) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using these parameters, multiple regression analysis enabled us to predict 34% of the survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (p less than 0.002), 38% of that of patients who had stable disease (p less than 0.04) and over 80% of that of patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High BM cellularity was the most predictive factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No factor was predictive for patients who died of cytopenic or other complications </plain></SENT>
