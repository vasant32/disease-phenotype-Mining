<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study if older patients perform poorly relative to younger adults following myeloablative allogeneic transplants, we compared the outcomes of consecutive adults aged &gt;or=50 years (n=51) to those &lt;50 years (n=262) who received BU, CY+/-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and allogeneic transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and NHL from 1984 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median ages were 53 (range 50-66) and 35 (range 18-49) years for older and younger patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were low-risk if they had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in CR1, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, or NHL in remission or sensitive relapse at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> others were high-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with low-risk disease, there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between older and younger adults (P=0.64), while older patients tended to have a shorter OS among high-risk patients (P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year OS was 53% (95% CI, 29-77%) compared to 60% (95% CI, 50-69%) for older and younger patients with low-risk disease, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding 3-year OS were 27% (95% CI, 11-43%) and 37% (95% CI, 25-45%) for high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In low-risk patients, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and treatment-related mortality were similar in older and younger patients, while older patients experienced more treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> by day 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, age &gt;or=50 years was a significant adverse factor only when high-risk patients were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that when radiation-free conditioning is used, age &gt;or=50 years is not a significant adverse risk factor for allogeneic BMT in patients with low-risk disease, and that such patients should not be excluded from conventional myeloablative approaches until the efficacy of nonmyeloablative transplantation is better established </plain></SENT>
