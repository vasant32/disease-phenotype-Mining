<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> among patients with Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) compared with patients receiving conventional therapy alone and to identify potential risk factors for their occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 1,732 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> treated at the British Columbia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Agency from 1976 to 2001, including 202 patients undergoing AHSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 9.8 years for the whole cohort, 9.7 years for those patients treated with conventional therapy, and 7.8 years from AHSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of developing any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> 15 years after therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> was 9% (risk ratio = 3.5; P &lt; .001); however, the incidence did not differ between those patients receiving conventional therapy alone compared with those undergoing AHSCT (10% and 8%, respectively; P = .48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with an increased risk of developing any second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> was age &gt; or = 35 years (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of therapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and therapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was seen for patients aged &gt; or = 35 years (P = .03) and stage III/IV (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> are at increased risk of developing a second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, those patients undergoing AHSCT do not seem to be at greater risk compared with those patients receiving conventional therapy alone, at least during the first decade after therapy </plain></SENT>
