<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that these anomalies occur in approximately 1.7% of patients with a chromosomally abnormal clone and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They may occur as the sole chromosome anomaly (8 of our patients) or with other abnormalities (5 of our patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints are not always the same, but band 13q14 always seems to be lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of chromosome analysis, 5 patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> or agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 2 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and one had an undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
