<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten-year (1985-1995) results of an expanded medical surveillance program of 2475 active employees and retirees of an oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Illinois are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the end of the program, 116 participants with persistent abnormalities of complete blood cell count had been referred for hematologic evaluation, and most were found to have benign conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 116 were referred for bone marrow and cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the referred active employees (seven) were found to have completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrows with no evidence of any myelopathic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the eight retirees, two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrows, one was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome-positive</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, one declined to participate, and four were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) of various subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of eight cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were identified, including six cases among program participants and two cases among nonparticipants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> standardized incidence ratio of 1.26 (95% confidence interval = 0.54-2.47) was not statistically significant, and there was virtually no increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in persons less than 80 years of age (4 observed and 3.8 expected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increase was entirely from program participants, probably because of intensive follow-up and diagnostic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Routine surveillance of complete blood cell count information did not identify any new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in active employees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the utility of expanded medical surveillance program in this population is very limited </plain></SENT>
