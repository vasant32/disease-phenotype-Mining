<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the in vitro effect of a truncated form of Mpl ligand, recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (rHuMGDF), on megakaryopoiesis in bone marrow from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used both semi-solid and suspension culture techniques to assess the effect of pegylated (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) rHuMGDF on megakaryocyte colony growth (CFU-Mk) and on the production of CD61+ cells in 7d suspension cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> rHuMGDF increased CFU-Mk growth and CD61+ cell production in a dose-dependent fashion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrows tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CFU-Mk growth was increased threefold with the addition of 10 ng/ml <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> rHuMGDF to cultures and CD61+ cells were increased 8-10-fold by the same dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although increased CFU-Mk growth was only seen in 1/10 AML and 6/16 MDS marrows, CD61+ cell numbers in suspension culture were increased in 9/13 AML and 12/15 MDS samples, responses ranged from very limited to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between platelet count and CFU-Mk number, CD61+ cell number or response to <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> rHuMGDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not find any increased CFU-GM colony or cluster growth in response to <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> rHuMGDF and the CD61+ cells produced in suspension culture had features of megakaryocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> rHuMGDF can enhance megakaryocyte proliferation in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and may have a role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
