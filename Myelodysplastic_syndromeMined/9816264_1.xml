<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the recently reported potential of stem cell factor (SCF) in restoring erythropoiesis in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), we first aimed to define a correlation between SCF serum levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous SCF levels in 50 MDS patients were determined by using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Broad interindividual variations were observed, but SCF serum levels were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range with no correlation to peripheral blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A soft agar culture system was used to further define the role of SCF for stimulation of erythroid growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononucleated cells of 20 MDS patients (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transition, and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) were investigated, and SCF plus Epo was able to stimulate burst-forming unit-erythroid significantly more than SCF or Epo alone independent of French-American-British group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When mononucleated cells from six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transition) with elevated serum Epo levels were incubated in the presence of SCF and autologous serum, a significant dose-dependent stimulation of burst-forming unit-erythroid number and cells per colony was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erythroid differentiation was further enhanced by adding serum with high colony-stimulating activity obtained from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high endogenous Epo serum levels SCF alone might be effective in stimulating erythropoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
