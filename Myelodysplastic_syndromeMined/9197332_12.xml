<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy sections were treated by appropriate antibodies and a labeling index (LI), duration of S-phase (Ts), and total cell cycle time (Tc) of myeloid cells were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean LI was 28.4%, Ts was 11.8 hours and Tc was 40.7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The %LI decreased as the disease evolved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> toward transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling of biopsy sections for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation showed that 30-90% of S-phase cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were simultaneously apoptotic or "antonymous." We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are highly proliferative disorders in which the ineffective hematopoiesis is probably the result of excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rather than slow proliferation </plain></SENT>
