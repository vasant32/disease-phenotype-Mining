<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> cases (N = 8), which served as a control group, those with a homozygous V617F mutation showed clear <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of 9p using SNP-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with possible genomic instability, in 19/30 MDS/MPD-U patients, we found additional lesions not identified by metaphase cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to UPD9p, we also have detected UPD affecting other chromosomes, including 1 (2/30), 11 (4/30), 12 (1/30) and 22 (1/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was observed in 8/30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 V617F+ patients who progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, we show that SNP-A can allow for the detection of two modes of transformation: leukemic blasts evolving from either a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> jak2 precursor carrying other acquired chromosomal defects, or from a V617F+ mutant progenitor characterized by UPD9p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SNP-A-based detection of cryptic lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328061" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD-U</z:e> may help explain the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disorder </plain></SENT>
