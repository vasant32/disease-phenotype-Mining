<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information on the physiological function of MLF1 is limited and mostly derived from studies identifying MLF1 interaction partners like CSN3, MLF1IP, MADM, Manp and the 14-3-3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 14-3-3-binding site surrounding S34 is one of the only known functional features of the MLF1 sequence, along with one nuclear export sequence (NES) and two nuclear localization sequences (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was recently shown that the subcellular localization of mouse MLF1 is dependent on 14-3-3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we investigated whether the subcellular localization of human MLF1 was also directly 14-3-3-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Live cell imaging with GFP-fused human MLF1 was used to study the effects of mutations and deletions on its subcellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that the subcellular localization of full-length human MLF1 is 14-3-3-independent, and is probably regulated by other as-yet-unknown proteins </plain></SENT>
