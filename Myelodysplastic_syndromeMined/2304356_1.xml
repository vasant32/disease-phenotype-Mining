<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into two groups according to the CFU-GM numbers on day 10: type I with low colony (CFU-GM less than 30) and type II with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to high colony formation (CFU-GM greater than or equal to 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was shorter for patients with an in vitro growth type II (5 months) than it was for patients with an in vitro growth type I (greater than 36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No relations was found between growth types and FAB-type, Bournemouth score or initial karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial bone marrow blast percentage correlated well with the in vitro growth number </plain></SENT>
