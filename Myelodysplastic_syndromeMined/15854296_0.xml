<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line was incubated in mixed culture of RPMI 1640 and DMEM with 15% bovine serum, but without cytokines; its biological characteristics were identified by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, surface marker profiles, cell proliferation, differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the established cell line could not depend on cytokines for long-term survival and growth, and could differentiate into colony-forming unit-macrophage, colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a cytokine-independent human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cell line, named <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-JSN04 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Nanjing Jiansu 04), was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its partial biological characteristics were identified and clarified </plain></SENT>
