<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which reflect the malignant nature of clonal cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), can be detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and potentially applied to assist diagnosis and evaluate prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, a series of immunophenotypes such as CD34, CD19, CD38, CD117, and CD7, which are related to proliferation and differentiation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, were determined by FCM in the patients with nonclonal cytopenias diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the expression pattern of these immunophenotypes, a FCM progress scoring (FPS) system was constructed and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FPS system showed good sensitivity and specificity (63.6% and 100.0%) in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from nonclonal cytopenias diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation analysis of FPS system indicated comparable sensitivity and specificity (73.7% and 97.1%) and high agreement rate (82.6%) of FCM diagnosis with morphological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had higher FPS score compared to low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noticeably, hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had lower FPS score (P &lt; 0.001), most of which could not be diagnosed by FPS system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, FPS score showed obvious positive correlation with WHO classification, IPSS score, percentage of marrow blasts, and cytogenetic prognosis scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated FPS score predicted higher disease progression and shorter survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FPS system based on immunophenotyping in CD34+ blasts is a useful and simple tool for diagnosis and prognosis evaluation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>.
