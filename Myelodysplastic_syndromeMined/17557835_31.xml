<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Murine Sall4 also has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining the properties of ES cells and governing the fate of the primitive inner cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that transcription from the Bmi-1 promoter is strikingly activated by SALL4 in a dose-dependent manner by using a luciferase reporter gene assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both promoter deletion construct studies and ChIP from a myeloid stem cell line, 32D, demonstrate that SALL4 binds to a specific region of the Bmi-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of one copy of Sall4 by gene targeting in mouse bone marrow significantly reduced Bmi-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reducing SALL4 expression by siRNA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line also results in significant down-regulation of Bmi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Bmi-1 expression is up-regulated in transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress human SALL4, and the levels of Bmi-1 in these mice increase as they progress from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to preleukemic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) and leukemic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>) stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High levels of H3-K4 trimethylation and H3-K79 dimethylation were observed in the SALL4 binding region of the Bmi-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a novel link between SALL4 and Bmi-1 in regulating self-renewal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3-K4 and H3-K79 methylation within the Bmi-1 promoter provides an epigenetic mechanism for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications in SALL4-mediated Bmi-1 gene deregulation </plain></SENT>
