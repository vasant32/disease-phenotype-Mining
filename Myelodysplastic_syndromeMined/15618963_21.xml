<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some HMGA2 fusion genes have been reported, several lines of evidence suggest that the critical pathogenic event is the expression of truncated HMGA2 isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the involvement of HMGA2 in six patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, dysplastic features and translocations or an inversion involving chromosome bands 12q13-15 and either 7p12, 8q22, 11q23, 12p11, 14q31 or 20q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Breaks within or very close to HMGA2 were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases by molecular cytogenetic analysis, leading to overexpression of this gene as assessed by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Truncated transcripts consisting of HMGA2 exons 1-2 or exons 1-3 spliced to intron-derived sequences were identified in two patients, but were not seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that abnormalities of HMGA2 play an important and previously unsuspected role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
