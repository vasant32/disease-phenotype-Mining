<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 men and 8 women (median age, 67 years), 20 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 3 had RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 5 had RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients did not respond at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and 22 showed an improvement in cytopenias (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three had a triple lineage response, 10 had a double lineage response, and 9 had a single lineage response (8 of 9 in absolute neutrophil count [ANC] and 1 had more than a 50% reduction in packed red blood cell transfusions) </plain></SENT>
