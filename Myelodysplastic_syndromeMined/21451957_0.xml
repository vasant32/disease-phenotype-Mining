<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived MUTZ-1 cell line and bone marrow mononuclear cells from primary high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were used to examine antitumor activity and drug interactions for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic proteins, including caspase and Bcl-2 family members, as well as the protein FLIP, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">Phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to examine the involvement of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> (AraC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DNR) were used to test for synergistic effects between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> and chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice xenografted with MUTZ-1 cells were used for in vivo study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms were related to decreased activation of the PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathway, but not the MAPK pathway, and involved inhibition of the NF-κB activity and downregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax and FLIPL/FLIPS ratios, triggering the activation of caspase cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> also acted synergistically with the chemotherapeutic agents AraC and DNR, which are associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells and had a synergistic effect with two chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
