<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a good response to high-dose treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> has additionally been attributed to a so-called low deamination phenotype of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, these findings would support plasma level monitoring of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and its metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> in high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pharmacokinetic study presents data attempting to reevaluate these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were treated by 3-h high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> infusions (9 patients 1000 mg/m2, 28 patients 3000 mg/m2) as part of their treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial blood samples during and post infusion were analysed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (araC) and its deamination product <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (araU) using HPLC with UV-detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considerable interindividual variation was observed in end-infusion plasma concentrations of araC (1000 mg/m2: 2.1-fold, 3000 mg/m2: 5.5-fold) and araU (1000 mg/m2: 2.7-fold, 3000 mg/m2: 2.9-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median ratio of end infusion concentrations araU/araC (on a molar basis) was 5.6 (S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3.0), extreme ratio values were 2 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences of the araU/araC ratio were found between the two dosages used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimum plasma araC concentrations at the end of infusion were 10.5 micromol/l and 22.0 micromol/l at a dose of 1000 and 3000 mg/m2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our European study population a "fast" deamination phenotype of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (araU/araC ratio &gt; 14) was not be observed </plain></SENT>
