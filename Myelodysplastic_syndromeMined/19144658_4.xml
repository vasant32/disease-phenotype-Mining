<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study of the outcomes of patients who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus seropositive at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (N=31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus were considered candidates for stem cell transplantation only if they had no significant evidence of hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matched controls (N=31) were seronegative for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019158" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatitides</z:e> and were paired according to age, diagnosis, disease stage, conditioning regimen and donor type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus seropositive patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seronegative patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls, N=1800) transplanted during the same period, to adjust for other confounding effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the seropositive patients was 49 (range 26-72); 15 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 6 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>, 6 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 1 Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 61% had poor risk disease; 68% had related donors; 68% received reduced intensity conditioning; 7 patients had mildly <z:mp ids='MP_0001573'>abnormal alanine transaminase levels</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> less than three times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) and 1 patient had minimally elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These characteristics were similar to those of the matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 3, 18 and 20 months, and 1-year survival was 29%, 56% and 56%, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus, matched and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls groups, respectively (hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.9-5.6, p&lt;0.001 in multivariate analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 43%, 24% and 23%, respectively (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.1, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> rates were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus seropositivity is a significant risk factor for non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation even in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or minimally <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function tests</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
