<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The expression of an MDS1-EVI1-like-1 (MEL1) gene is reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MEL1 (at chromosome band 1p36.3) is thought to be transcriptionally activated as a result of juxtaposition to the RPN1 gene at 3q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether MEL1 expression is restricted to cases with this particular translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measured MEL1 expression levels, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, and distinct blood cell fractions in 162 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the existence of an EVI1-like gene (EL1) by applying the same method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The existence of these transcripts was confirmed by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MEL1 expression was detected in 87% (141/162) of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EL1 transcript also was detected in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EL1 expression levels highly correlated with MEL1 expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variable MEL1/EL1 expression levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with favorable-risk karyotypes, i.e., with t(15;17), t(8;21), or inv(16), showed low MEL1/EL1 expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of MEL1/EL1 compared with MDS1-EVI1/EVI1 in distinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow or blood cell fractions revealed that 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four gene products are expressed in CD34(+) progenitor cell fractions; 2) both MEL1 and EVI1 are turned down in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages; while 3) MDS1-EVI1 and EL1 remain expressed in mature blood cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that simultaneous low MEL1/EL1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is abnormal and that favorable disease is highly associated with this abnormal phenotype </plain></SENT>
