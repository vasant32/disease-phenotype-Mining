<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prognostic indices such as the IPSS were developed and later validated assuming their predictive values to be unchanged over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic analysis of the possible variability of predictive power over time in different scores is still lacking and was the aim of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: For 243 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from a single institution treated with supportive care, 19 established or modified scoring systems based on different prognostic factors (clinical, cytogenetical and/or comorbidity) were analysed for their variability over time by statistical methods that quantify time variations in the risk relations (specifically the risk ratios of Cox models) between prognostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Established scores based mainly on clinical parameters showed strong to moderate loss of predictive power over time whereas cytogenetic scores maintained their predictive power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scores including comorbidity data showed gain of predictive power over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development and comparison of prognostic systems have to take into account their stability versus the possibility or need for re-evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possibly not only re-evaluation after time is of importance, but also different weighting of items constituting scores </plain></SENT>
