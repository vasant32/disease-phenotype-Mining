<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 61 patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) diagnosed in our hospitals, 37 survived more than 2 years; actuarial survival of this latter group was 58%, with a median follow-up of living patients of 10.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and clinical data pertaining to these long-term survivors was scrutinized to determine the incidence of clonal disorders, which was identified in 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological evidence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was found in 13 (35%), including four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>; four (11%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 23 patients studied, four showed karyotypic abnormalities, but these did not always coincide with morphological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although four patients now have completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood and marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and another had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood and marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to unrelated disease, the study confirms the high incidence of cytopenia and morphological abnormality, sufficient to justify a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in patients with a history of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No definite survival plateau was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> secondary to AA seems to be different to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> arising de novo; the clinical course is relatively indolent, possibly implying a different biology </plain></SENT>
