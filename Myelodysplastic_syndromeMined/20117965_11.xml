<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants now use peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) instead of bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term data on outcome and late effects of PBPCT compared with BMT are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present long-term data from a randomised study comparing PBPCT with BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between February, 1995, and September, 1999, 329 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> received either PBPCT (n=163) or BMT (n=166) from HLA-identical sibling donors after central randomisation accounting for stratification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were collected via questionnaires from 87% (176 of 202; 84 PBPCT, 92 BMT) patients who survived for more than 3 years (median of 9.3 years) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy analyses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01020175 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 10-year overall survival was 49.1% for patients who underwent PBPCT and 56.5% for patients who underwent BMT (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60-1.15; p=0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>Leukaemia</z:mpath>-free survival was 28.3% with BMT versus 13.0% with PBPCT (0.61, CI 0.32-1.16; p=0.12) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>; 62.3% with BMT versus 47.1% with PBPCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (0.67, 0.39-1.16; p=0.16); and 40.2% with BMT versus 48.5% with PBPCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (1.12, 0.73-1.74; p=0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> after PBPCT (n=56, 73%) than after BMT (n=46, 56%; p=0.021), with more frequent involvement of skin, liver, and oral mucosa, and more patients who underwent PBPCT needed immunosuppressive treatment 5 years after transplantation (n=20, 26%) than patients who had BMT (n=10, 12%; p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there was no difference in performance status, return to work, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo>, and haematopoietic function between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>14 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> occurred (five after BMT, nine after PBPCT), resulting in a cumulative incidence of 3% and 7% after BMT and PBPCT (p=0.17), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: More than 9 years after transplantation, overall and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-free survival remain similar in patients who underwent BMT and PBPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Differences in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and the duration of immunosuppression exist, but do not affect survival, general health status, or late events </plain></SENT>
