<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the impact of age on transplant outcomes in patients older than 50 years of age who underwent conventional allo-SCT in 8 institutions in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 52-years old (range 50 to 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases included severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 18), and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients (67%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> received allo-SCT in an advanced disease stage at the time of transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two-year overall survival and disease-free survival rate were 50.1% and 43.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, the two-year probability rates of survival were 54.3% with standard risk patients, and 45.9% with poor risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, the kind of grafts, and age (&gt; or = 55) were related to poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that prophylaxis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and selection of the graft is more important for older patients, and that patients less than 55-years old can be candidates for conventional allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
