<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The long arm of chromosome 20 displays recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for microsatellite markers in blast cells from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the region of deletion and to precisely establish its frequency, we searched for LOH in 103 children with ALL using polymorphic markers in the previously described region of interest, namely between D20S101 and D20S887 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LOH was detected in nine patients (ie with a frequency of 8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one patient, a small deletion was found, flanked proximally by D20S850 and distally by M201, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat identified from chromosome 20 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distance between these two markers is approximately 1000 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of non-random deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 has previously been observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>) in 5-10% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The small deletion in our patient is located within the common region of deletion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> suggesting that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene may be the common target of the deletions in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
