<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We exposed HL60 cells to the highest level of bifunctional alkylating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>) that was consistent with recovery following suppressed growth </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A moderate up-regulation of S100P <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was consistently observed after 1 day of exposure to bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and expression was not induced with monofunctional agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated S100P protein/antigen was not detected until days later in a subset of non-mitotic G2 cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results confirm recent reports indicating that S100P is a survival factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results indicate that S100P has a specific role in G2 cell function associated with a prolonged phase of recovery after exposure to bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
