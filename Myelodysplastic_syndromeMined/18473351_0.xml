<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of XL119 in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients were treated at 7 dose levels ranging from 140 to 260 mg/m(2)/daily times 5 in a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consenting patients had correlative biologic parameters studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3/4 mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recommended phase 2 dose in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> is 240 mg/m(2)/daily times 5 in a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant reduction in bone marrow blasts were seen in 5 patients and additional patients had reductions in peripheral blood blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the responses were transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels from Day 1 to Day 7 correlated negatively with changes in peripheral blood blasts from Day 1 to Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further assessment of XL119 in combination with other agents in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
