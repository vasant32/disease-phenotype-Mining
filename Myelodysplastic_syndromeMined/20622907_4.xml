<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared outcomes of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and conventional intensity conditioning (CIC) in 101 consecutive patients (CIC, 62; RIC, 39) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> aged 40-60 years undergoing alloHCT from 2002 to 2008 at our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age, unrelated transplants and co-morbidity index were higher in the RIC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median OS and EFS were 31.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-59.3) and 20.7 months (95% CI: 11.0-30.4), respectively, with no significant difference between the two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse were 28% (95% CI: 21-39) and 25% (95% CI: 17-36), respectively, with no significant difference between the two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in OS, EFS, TRM or relapse was observed between the two cohorts in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only disease risk was significantly associated with OS (Hazard ratio (HR): 1.85, CI: 1.01-3.45), EFS (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.00-3.10) and cumulative relapse (HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.08-10.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease biology rather than intensity of conditioning regimen seems to determine outcomes of alloHCT in patients aged 40-60 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
