<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included 29 ANLL, 27 ALL, six <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Durations between the first BMT (BMT1) to relapse and BMT1 to BMT2 were 13.5 +/- 13.7 months and 17.4 +/- 13.9 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donors for BMT2 were replaced in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were in CR (or CP) at BMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed in those who received BMT2 within 12 months after BMT1, mostly caused by regimen-related toxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival rate was 28% at 2 years and 16% at 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing the poor prognosis after BMT2 were early (&lt;6 months) relapse, early (&lt;12 months) BMT2, not in remission at BMT2, and ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensified conditioning did not affect either remission duration or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 39 cases observed for more than 100 days, 18 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) and showed longer remission duration than those without cGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our analysis indicates that BMT2 as treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse is effective in selected cases, and exploration of pre-BMT treatment and post-BMT immunotherapy is warranted </plain></SENT>
