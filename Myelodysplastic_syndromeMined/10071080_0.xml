<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between low SCF levels and 'leukemic' in vitro growth, the number of clusters and the colony/cluster ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between BM plasma SCF levels, the pattern of growth and CD34+ c-kit+ expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data seem to exclude any direct effect of SCF on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, but suggest that low plasma SCF levels may be at least partially responsible for leukemic growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
