<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 180 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=39) or sAML (n=69) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for outcomes were analyzed using the Fine and Gray method and the Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 43 (18-72) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 77 patients (71%) received a single UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) was given to 57 (53%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median numbers of nucleated and CD34(+) cells at freezing were 3.6 × 10(7) and 1.1 × 10(5) kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 60 days, cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 78±4% and was independently associated with the number of CD34(+) cells per kg (&gt;1.1 × 10(5); P=0.005) and advanced disease status (blasts &lt;5% at time of UCBT, P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly higher after MAC (62 vs 34%; P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 2-year disease-free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 30 and 34%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, patients with high-risk disease (blasts &gt;5% and International Prognostic scoring system (IPSS) intermediate-2 or high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) had significant poorer DFS (hazard ratio (HR): 1.76; P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In spite of high NRM, these data indicate that UCBT is an acceptable alternative option to treat adults with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or sAML, without a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor </plain></SENT>
