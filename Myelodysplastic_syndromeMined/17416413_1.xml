<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the in vitro effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> and two structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, Tricostatin A) on clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on morphological criteria we identified four major colony types: (i) non-erythroid colonies, (ii) erythroid colonies that were detected only for a subset of patients and could be further sub classified into mature and immature forms, and (iii) intermediate colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid differentiation was associated with low CD34 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colonies showed differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, viability, cell cycle distribution and expression of differentiation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> and the two HDAC inhibitors altered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell expression of differentiation markers, whereas the drugs did not have any major influence on cell cycle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the pharmacological effects differed between the four colony subsets, and differences were also detected between the two HDAC inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells can be classified into well-defined subsets based on their differentiation, and these subsets differ in their biological characteristics as well as their response to pharmacological targeting of epigenetic regulation </plain></SENT>
