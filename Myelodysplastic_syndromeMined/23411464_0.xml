<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By focusing on cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>), a subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, our genome-wide profiling showed âˆ¼4600 annotated gene promoters with increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computational analysis revealed a statistically significant enrichment of the PU.1-binding DNA motif (PU-box) in the regions with increased H3K27me3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship between the levels of H3K27me3 and the levels of PU.1 binding and its downstream myeloid gene expressions was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-exome sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing analysis revealed some recurrent mutations, but no mutations in the PU.1 regulatory regions or in the EZH1/2, H3K27 methytransferase encoding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived erythroid/myeloid line and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow cells, we demonstrated that H3K27me3 inhibitors can increase the expression of PU.1 and its downstream genes and also promote cell differentiation via reducing H3K27me3 at the PU.1 gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, ectopic expression of PU.1 significantly inhibited proliferation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we propose a hypothetical model of epigenetic inactivation of the PU.1 pathway due to increased H3K27me3 in some cases of CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
