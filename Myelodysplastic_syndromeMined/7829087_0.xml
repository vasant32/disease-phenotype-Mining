<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The protein-tyrosine kinase gene Itk is expressed preferentially in T lymphoid cells of the mouse and is induced by IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A related gene, Btk, is expressed in the murine B lymphoid and myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because mutations in Btk and the corresponding human gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndromes, it was of interest to map Itk and its human counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny of two multilocus crosses, murine Itk was mapped to Chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By fluorescence in situ hybridization, human ITK was mapped to 5q32-q33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Murine Itk and its human homologue lie within regions of conserved synteny that include several growth factor and growth factor receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region in humans is frequently deleted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, suggesting possible involvement of ITK in this disorder </plain></SENT>
