<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) is a subtype of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have reported concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and T-cell large granular lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (T-LGL), coexistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and T-LGL has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a unique case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> plus an underlying T-LGL-type clonal proliferation in a patient with a long standing history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Multiparametric immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was conducted using fresh peripheral blood collected in EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, morphologic evaluation of the peripheral blood smear and T-cell gene rearrangement studies by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Flow cytometric analysis revealed abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> with multiple aberrancies including expression of cross-lineage markers CD2 and CD56, plus reduced expression of multiple antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, abnormal CD8+ T-cells were identified, demonstrating dim expression of CD5 and dim to complete loss of CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In correlation with clinical history and morphologic review, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> plus underlying abnormal CD8+ T-cell lymphoproliferation was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clonality of these abnormal T-cells was confirmed by T-cell gene rearrangement studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: We have identified a unique case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in association with subclinical T-LGL, neither of which, alone, could fully explain the clinicopathologic features identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the coexistence of these two entities may not be coincidental, and it is likely that they may share a common pathogenic pathway related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune-dysregulation</z:hpo>.
