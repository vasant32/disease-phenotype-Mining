<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen allo-HSCT patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens (group A) and 13 patients with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens (group B) were assessed retrospectively in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received physical exercise immediately after neutrophil engraftment at the class 10,000 bioclean room (class 10,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean daily steps at class 10,000 were measured as a substitute for the amount of physical activity, and the duration of hospitalization as one of the clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of physical activity showed a negative correlation with the duration of hospitalization in group A (r = -.71; P = .0071), regardless of complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and cytomegalovirus reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant association in group B (r = .09; P = .77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The improved physical activity through early rehabilitation may be an independent, favorable prognostic factor for allo-HSCT patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
