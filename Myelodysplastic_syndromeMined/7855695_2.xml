<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the usefulness of different published epidemiological and analytic parameters to decide the treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) of anaemic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have revised 10 published series compiling 115 patients, studying age, sex, initial diagnosis, route of administration and posology, criteria of response, duration of the study, dosis with the response was obtained, response according to initial diagnosis, duration of responses, and effect of the treatment on other hematopoietic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have made a comparison between responders and non-responders based on epidemiological and analytical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have compiled 115 patients with a rate of global response of 23.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have not found significative differences between the route (s.c. or i.v.) or frequency of administration, however the number of responses was higher when rHuEPO was administered three times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A great variability in the criteria of response was observed among the different studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of studies have a duration of three months but we have observed significative differences in the number of responses when the study is longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have not found significative differences between responders and non-responders with respect to age, sex, used dosis, transfusional dependency and degree of transfusional dependency, basal serum erythropoietin, time since diagnosis, transfusional period, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level among non-transfusion dependent patients and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level among transfusion dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have found significative differences with respect to initial diagnosis, a higher rate of responses was observed in the refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have not found a higher rate of transformations into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of the treatment on other haematopoietic series can be considered as anecdotical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The different epidemiological and analytic parameters published up to now are not useful in the decision of including an anaemic patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the treatment with rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> can be benefited with the treatment with rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The concomitant use of other cytokines could improve these results </plain></SENT>
