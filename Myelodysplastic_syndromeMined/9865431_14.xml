<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prev., 5: 639-644, 1996), clonal aberrations in chromosome 8 have been reported to be in excess in smokers and in workers exposed to paints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In that study, cytogenetics was performed after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our report, we describe a population-based survey on nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in northern Italy, in which 79 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, or other nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>) were studied before cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found 9 aberrations involving chromosome 8 (six +8, two -8, and one translocation), whereas abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and 7 occurred with a low frequency compared with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aberrations involving chromosome 8 were associated with smoking (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-42.3; among smokers of 10 or more cigarettes/day: odds ratio, 14.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-142.3); +8 aberrations were found in 1 of 24 nonsmokers and in 5 of 38 smokers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low frequency of chromosome 5 and 7 aberrations in our population-based series (compared with other studies) can be attributed to the recruitment before cytotoxic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aberrations involving chromosome 8 (particularly +8) were associated with smoking habits </plain></SENT>
