<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, seven RAEBt and six sAML) received chemotherapy before BMT resulting in complete remission in 10 patients (six RAEBt and four sAML) at the time of BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen marrow donors were genotypically HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remaining donors were other family members (five) or unrelated donors (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The status of the underlying disease at the time of conditioning was the major factor determining long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease-freed survival of RA patients and patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, RAEBt and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> but transplanted in complete remission, was respectively 50 and 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, none of the nine high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients transplanted with persistent disease, survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome after transplantation with alternative donors was inferior with one long-term survivor, mainly related to the high incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and its accompanying infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients relapsed resulting in an actuarial probability of relapse of 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients died of transplant-related complications leading to a non-relapse mortality at 5 years of 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At present eight patients are alive and disease-free 20 to 132 months post-transplantation resulting in an actuarial 5-year disease-free survival of 40.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a feasible treatment option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, improvement in GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care to reduce transplant-treated mortality and improved relapse prevention are imperative </plain></SENT>
