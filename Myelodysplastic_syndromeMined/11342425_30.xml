<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, it was found that the percentage of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow and the in vitro colony formation from CD34(+) cells of patients with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> were markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, and because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is central in the pathogenesis of bone marrow dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, this study was initiated to delineate the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the pathogenesis of the marrow failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven children with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, patients' marrow mononuclear cells plated in clonogenic cultures showed a significantly higher tendency to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The defect in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> was found in patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients showed a more prominent decrease in colony formation and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> after preincubation with activating anti-Fas antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fas expression on marrow cells from patients was significantly higher than from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between patients and controls for Fas expression was also significant for the following cell fraction subpopulations: CD34(-)/CD38(-), CD34(-)/CD38(+), and CD34(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> hematopoietic progenitors are intrinsically flawed and have faulty proliferative properties and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>Bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> appears mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> as the central pathogenetic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increased propensity for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is linked to increased expression of the Fas antigen and to hyperactivation of the Fas signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
