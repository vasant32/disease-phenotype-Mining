<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With increasing numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors, there is interest in the ongoing assessment of therapy-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A medical record validation of patient-reported complications following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed using a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 100 patients who had undergone BMT at the City of Hope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following self-reported complications were validated using medical records: ocular, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using information from medical records as the standard, sensitivities ranged from 52.9% for subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> to 100% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specificities ranged from 75.4% for ocular complications to 100% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was intermediate to excellent agreement (kappa = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4-1.0) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complications evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the agreement between self-reporting and medical records was good for complications with clear diagnostic criteria that are easily communicated to the patient, but was diminished for complications with non-established diagnostic criteria (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001097'>xerophthalmia</z:hpo>) or a fluctuating course (<z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall these results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors can self-report serious complications with an acceptable level of accuracy in epidemiological research </plain></SENT>
