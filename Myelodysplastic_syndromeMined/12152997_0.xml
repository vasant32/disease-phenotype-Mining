<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with X and Y probes to monitor recipient T (R-T) cell clearance early after myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that impaired clearance of residual host-T-cells in the early days post-transplant was associated with graft rejection, while enhanced clearance could be an indicator of increased donor anti-host alloreactivity and predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although FISH is the most accurate quantitative molecular tool for the determination of the exact donor/recipient-T-cell numbers at any time points post-transplant, it has the disadvantage of being limited to sex mismatched donor/recipient pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to develop a molecular approach that, irrespective of gender, would be comparable to FISH in accurately determining host residual T-cell clearance after myeloablative conditioning for ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have genotyped DNA from cell lysates using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeats (STR) with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primers, and used the Genescan 672 software for accurate quantitative analysis of the amplified alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that this approach allowed us to achieve in T-cells accurate quantitative analyses of amplified donor/recipient alleles in sex matched patients on days +5, +8 and +12 post-transplant, despite severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
