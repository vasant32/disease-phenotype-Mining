<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here results of a molecular cytogenetic analysis of this translocation in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using FISH with a panel of 11q and 21q cosmid/YAC probes, we localized the chromosome 11 breakpoint at q23.3 in a region flanked by CP-921G9 and CP-939H3 YACs, distal to the HRX/MLL locus frequently involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 21 breakpoint was mapped in a 800-kb fragment inserted into the CP-145E3 YAC at 21q11.2, proximal to the AML1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases with a t(11;21) reported until now, a second der(11)t(11;21) and loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 11 could be observed either at diagnosis or during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since in our case heteromorphism was detected by FISH on the centromeric region of the two der(11), the second der(11) chromosome could be the result of a mitotic recombination that had occurred on the long arm of chromosome 11, rather than of duplication of the original der(11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Constancy of secondary karyotypic changes resulting in an extra copy of the putative chimeric gene at der(11), loss of 11 qter sequences, and partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with a t(11;21) may be driven by the same mechanism(s) </plain></SENT>
