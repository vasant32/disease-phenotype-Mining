<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between nonleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and various features recorded at presentation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with ring sideroblasts, and RA with excess of blasts was analyzed in 251 patients using the proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Features associated with higher nonleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were: 1% or more metamyelocytes in peripheral blood (PB); lower 59Fe incorporation rate; 1% or more blasts in PB; lower hematocrit or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>; presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001902'>giant platelets</z:hpo>; 1 microgram/liter or higher serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels; higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff positive erythroblasts; and 1% or higher promyelocytes in PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was also performed using the following predictor variables: metamyelocytes in PB, micromegakaryocytes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001902'>giant platelets</z:hpo>, presence or absence of RA with excess of blasts, and mononuclear large megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided arbitrarily into low (hazard ratio, less than 0.55), intermediate (hazard ratio, 0.55-1.5), and high (hazard ratio, greater than 1.5) risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative nonleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates in the high and intermediate risk groups reached a median at 602 and 1984 days from presentation, respectively, while the rate reached a plateau level of 49.4% after 2644 days in the low risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for leukemic transformation and nonleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were found to be different and to need separate consideration </plain></SENT>
