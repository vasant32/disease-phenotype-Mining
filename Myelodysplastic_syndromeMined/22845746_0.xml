<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> is a major problem in chronically transfused patients because of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic reactions</z:e> and limited availability of compatible blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at determining the characteristics of RBC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in transfusion-dependent patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The transfusion and clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> seen at our hospital from 1990 to 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of RBC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> was calculated by taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a competing risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were compared by Poisson multivariate regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 74 years; 55% were men and had received a median of 33 (range, 4-421) RBC units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (15%) patients formed 81 alloantibodies and seven autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three additional patients developed autoantibodies without alloantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of RBC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> was 1 per 10.5 person-years and was independent of sex, age, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnostic category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> increased with the number of RBC transfusions, reaching a plateau at 19.5% after 130 RBC units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common antibody specificities were Kell (26 cases), E (19), c (5), and Jk(a) (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 26 (62%) of the 42 alloimmunized patients, only the Rh system and Kell were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RBC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> occurs in 15% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion support and mostly involves the Rh system and Kell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Transfusing these patients with extended antigen-matched blood, including Kell and CcEe antigens, would presumably reduce the RBC immunization rate </plain></SENT>
