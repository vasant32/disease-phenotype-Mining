<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Hellström-Lindberg score (HLS) (1997) is designed to predict erythroid response to erythropoietin treatment in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to test the validity of this scoring system, 58 patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, treated with a "standard dose" approach between 2001 and 2010, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The response to erythropoietin treatment was evaluated in accordance with the "international working group" (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the patients only two were scored "poor," 12 "intermediate," and 44 "good" (15 of whom were scored "3" and 29 "4") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the system was verified as a predictive tool for response to erythropoietin therapy, we noted that of patients scored as "good," those with a numerical score of "4" responded more frequently than did those scored "3", as evaluated under both the 2006- and 2000-IWG ("major response") criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modest response rate in patients scoring "3" did not show a difference in response rate in comparison to the "intermediate" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present data suggest that only patients scoring "4" on the scale may show an adequate response to the standard dose erythropoietin therapy, while frontline high-dose therapy should be offered to other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further analysis considering endogenous erythropoietin as a possible determinant of response revealed the optimal cut-off value of 80 mIU/mL, instead of the value of 100 mIU/mL utilized by the HLS </plain></SENT>
