<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to identify S-phase cells which have incorporated both or either one of the labels in vivo by using two monoclonal antibodies in vitro permitted the measurement of labeling index (LI) and durations of S-phase (Ts) and the total cell cycle (Tc) both from the BM aspirates and biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the LI is 2-3 times higher in biopsies, Ts and Tc are fairly comparable in the two samples in 8/10 cases (p = 0.02 and 0.003 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advantages associated with the determination of cell cycle parameters in BM biopsies have been discussed at length </plain></SENT>
