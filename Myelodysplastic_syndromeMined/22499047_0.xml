<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Markov model was developed to estimate the total additional direct cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> therapy versus best-supportive care in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> was evaluated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which represents the additional cost per QALY gained from the more effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> therapy was 1.83 million yen more costly per patient but yielded an additional 0.353 QALYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ICER (Increment of Cost-effectiveness Ratio) was 5.18 million yen per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, because the ICER was less than the threshold for acceptable cost-effectiveness in Japan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient was assumed to be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
