<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>Monocytosis</z:mp> associated with G-CSF has been reported in anecdotal literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0862941" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pseudoleukemia</z:e> secondary to G-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients initially presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with chromosome 7 abnormalities that evolved into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case one had deletion 7q while case two initially had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and subsequently developed a balanced translocation between the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 and long (q) arm of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the induction chemotherapy and G-CSF administration, both of these patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0862941" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pseudoleukemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 had white blood cell (WBC) count of 26 x 10(9)/l with 72% monocytes, while patient two had WBC of 14.1 x 10(9)/l with 30% monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients the <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> resolved after the discontinuation of G-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, patients treated with G-CSF should be followed closely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0862941" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pseudoleukemia</z:e> discontinuation of the drug with no supplemental chemotherapy is probably enough to control the atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
