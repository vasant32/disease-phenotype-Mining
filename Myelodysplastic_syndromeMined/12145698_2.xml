<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The advent of continuous human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as a rich resource of abundant, accessible and manipulable living cells has contributed significantly to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the establishment of the new continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line MUTZ-8 from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>): MUTZ-8 was derived from the peripheral blood of a 63-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4 (25 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA fingerprinting confirmed authenticity and derivation of the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunoprofiling as determined by flow cytometry showed that MUTZ-8 is positive mainly for myeloid but also some monocytic and megakaryocytic markers, whereas it is negative for T cell, B cell and erythroid markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell line is constitutively cytokine-dependent, proliferation requiring externally added cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytokine response profiles showed a two- to 10-fold growth stimulation of the cells by various cytokines, whereas other cytokines led to growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the common clonal derivation of the cell line and the malignant clone predominating at the times of sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUTZ-8 displays a deletion of the 5q31 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> region effected by a non-reciprocal translocation, t(5;11)(q21;q10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scientific utility of MUTZ-8 lies (1) in its cluster of pathognomonic cytogenetic alterations including a 5q31 breakpoint and (2) in its absolute cytokine dependency and proliferative response to various cytokines </plain></SENT>
