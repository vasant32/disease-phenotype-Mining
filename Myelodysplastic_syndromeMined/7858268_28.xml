<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients (51%) received transplants in first relapse or second complete remission (CR), whereas 33 (39%) received transplants after second or subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of analysis in April 1994, fifty-seven patients (67%) are alive, including 44 (52%) in continuous CR, with a median follow-up for the surviving patients of 28 months (range, 7 to 66) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three independent prognostic variables were identified by univariate analysis: number of prior chemotherapy regimens, prior radiotherapy, and extranodal disease at ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate stepwise Cox regression identified the number of prior chemotherapy regimens as the only significant prognostic factor predicting for both relapse and DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the outcome of the treatment between the two preparative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that high-dose therapy and ABMT is an effective therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
