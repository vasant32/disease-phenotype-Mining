<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, and lenalidomide, have yielded hematologic and cytogenetic responses in a substantial portion of patients, these therapies are not curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Active investigation of novel targets with biological relevance in myelopoiesis has stimulated the pharmacologic development of a multitude of agents that show promise in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of these drugs have entered or completed early phase clinical testing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and include immunomodulatory agents, immunosuppressive therapies, survival signal inhibitors, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents, pharmacologic differentiators, and anti-angiogenic and apoptotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As we continue to collect clinical experience with these agents, the repertoire of available therapeutics for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will expand and provide a foundation for novel therapeutic combinations </plain></SENT>
