<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early diagnosis of EBV reactivation and pre-emptive therapy may be clinically useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three patients who presented with an extremely high EBV load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma without evidence of EBV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following pre-emptive therapy with a single dose of rituximab, a concordant decrease of EBV-genome copies and B lymphocytes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, no EBV-associated LPD occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pre-emptive therapy with rituximab appears to be effective for prevention of EBV-associated LPD after HSCT </plain></SENT>
