<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structurally complex constitutes a new definition of complex karyotype characterized by more than or equal to 3 chromosomal aberrations, including at least one structural aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival in patients with more than or equal to 3 clonal aberrations, which were not structurally complex, did not differ from that observed in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis revealed the presence of a monosomal and structurally complex karyotype to be strongly associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio = 4.6, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, a structurally complex karyotype without a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> was associated with a very short 2-year overall survival probability of only 14% (hazard ratio = 14.5; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of a structurally complex karyotype was the strongest independent prognostic marker predicting poor outcome in children with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
