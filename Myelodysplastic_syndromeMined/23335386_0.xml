<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>) in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study of 226 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P &lt; 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant </plain></SENT>
