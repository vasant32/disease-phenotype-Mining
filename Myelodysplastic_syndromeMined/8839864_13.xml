<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An acquired deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a recurrent abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of 20q deletions with myeloid "stem cell" disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes, loss or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions in peripheral blood (PB) granulocytes and defined a commonly deleted region of 16 to 21 centimorgan (cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events, neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied 48 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera and four patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each case, cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen microsatellite markers that span the common deleted region were used to search for loss of heterozygosity in granulocyte DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhibited allele loss on 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at distal markers was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor assay (HUMARA) was used to determine granulocyte clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the granulocytes were clonally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients the granulocytes appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both granulocytes and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results show that, in the vast majority of patients presented here, the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity cannot be attributed to the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> polyclonal granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder </plain></SENT>
