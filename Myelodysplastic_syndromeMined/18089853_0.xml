<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP; also referred to as IFN regulatory factor 8) is a transcription factor which is expressed in myeloid and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we found that ICSBP activated transcription of the gene encoding gp91(PHOX) (the CYBB gene), a rate-limiting component of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase expressed exclusively after the promyelocyte stage of myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we found that CYBB transcription was dependent on phosphorylation of specific ICSBP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since ICSBP is tyrosine-phosphorylated during myelopoiesis, this provided a mechanism of differentiation stage-specific CYBB transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current studies, we found that ICSBP was a substrate for Src homology-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>) in immature myeloid cells but not during myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, SHP2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> inhibited CYBB transcription and respiratory burst activity in myeloid progenitor cells by dephosphorylating ICSBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found that ICSBP was a substrate for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated, constitutively active mutant form of SHP2, described previously, throughout differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, constitutive SHP2 activation blocked ICSBP-induced CYBB transcription and respiratory burst activity in differentiating myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICSBP-deficiency and constitutive SHP2 activation have been described in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As these two abnormalities may coexist, our results identified a potential molecular mechanism for impaired phagocyte function in this malignant myeloid disease </plain></SENT>
