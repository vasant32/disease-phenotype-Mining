<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine prognostic factors characterizing haematopoietic cell kinetics, bone marrow proliferative activity and serum TNF-a levels were measured in 51 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was evaluated by employing a monoclonal antibody directed against the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCNA proliferating index (PCNA PI) and serum TNF-a levels showed significant differences between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCNA PI and serum TNF-a were significantly higher in the high risk for leukemic transformation FAB subgroups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) in comparison to the low risk group (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCNA PI and TNF-a also increased with increasing IPSS score (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was noted between TNF-a concentrations and PCNA PI (r:0.36, p&lt;0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis using the log-rank test showed that a higher PCNA PI was associated with a significantly shorter survival (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that elevated PCNA PI and TNF-a serum levels are increased in high risk myelodysplastic disease and that a high PCNA PI is predictive of a shorter survival in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
