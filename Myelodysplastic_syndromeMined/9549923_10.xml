<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is a prevalent disease of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the progressive aging of the general population, the frequency of the disease will further increase, especially in very old individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 70 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients aged over 75 years, we investigated the clinico-hematological characteristics and treatment results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy patients aged &gt; 75 were diagnosed at our institutions as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> between January 1987 and December 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This figure represents 8% of the whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient population observed during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were studied concerning the main clinical and hematological features at presentation, therapeutic approach and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 10 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trilinear <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was present in 28 patients (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 12 cases (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was found in 12 patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aggressive chemotherapy was given to 22 patients (31%), low-dose ARA-C (LDARA-C) to 7 patients (10%), while 41 (58%) were managed with supportive care and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic choice was significantly influenced by performance status (p = .03), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (p = .0001), severe co-morbid disease (p = .0001), and hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosis (p = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 7/22 patients aggressively treated (32%), 0/7 in the LD-ARA-C group, and in one patient treated with HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median survival for the whole patient population was 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference among the three treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, patients achieving CR experienced significantly longer survival as did those with hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a relevant selection at diagnosis, intensive chemotherapy is not appropriate for the majority of very old patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, since a minority of patients takes substantial advantage from an aggressive approach, any effort should be made to preliminarily identify this subset at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
