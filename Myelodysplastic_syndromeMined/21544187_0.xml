<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with episodic <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp>, he was anemic and thrombocytopenic, and his bone marrow biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> from treatment for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_252'>oligodendroglioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recognition of this entity is becoming increasingly important as the incidence of cardiac myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> may be on the rise as the number of patients receiving chemotherapy increases </plain></SENT>
