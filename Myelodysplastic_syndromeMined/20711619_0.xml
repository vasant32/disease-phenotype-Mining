<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein profiles obtained were correlated to cytogenetic and molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis, at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, at de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosis and 3Â months following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, non-leukemic pediatric patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and molecular analyses were carried out by G banding and polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differential proteomic analysis was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were noted between protein patterns and cytogenetic or molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Certain suppressor genes, metabolic enzymes, immunoglobulins and actin-binding proteins were differentially expressed by BM or PB plasma and cell lysates compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obtained data showed that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and gelsolin played contradicting roles in contributing and restraining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, while MOES, EZRI and AIFM1 could be considered as biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
