<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of KIS were successfully reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of p27(Kip1) in CEM, MOLT4 and SUP-B15 cells were not affected by the transduction with siRNA KIS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed that KIS protein directly interacted with p27(Kip1) protein, and reduction of KIS inhibited the S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On these cells transfected with siRNA KIS, the inhibition of S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) was strongly suppressed cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inhibition of S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) increased a significant population in G0/G1 fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated that the KIS activity was induced during G0/G1, and it promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylation of S10 on p27(Kip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed that KIS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> specimens (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); 37, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); 72, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL); 23), and the mean ratios of KIS to G3PDH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ALL specimens were 3.62+/-0.68, 3.27+/-0.73 and 3.17+/-0.58, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that KIS protein was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 132 adults cases of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, including 37 AML (8 M1, 12 M2, 2 M3, 7 M4, 8 M5), 72 MDS (42 RAEB-I, 30 REAB-II) and 23 ALL (23 L2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the elevated levels of KIS protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells promote the cell cycle progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
