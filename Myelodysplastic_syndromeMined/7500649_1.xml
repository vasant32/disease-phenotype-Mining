<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor p53 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry in the neutrophils and some monocytes of the peripheral blood preparation using the antibody DO-1, recognizing mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> p53 protein conformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no positive staining in the peripheral blood samples from 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis performed on DNA extracted from the cytospin preparations from this patient indicated no mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report describes the unusual detection of elevated p53 protein in a non-neoplastic condition by immunohistochemistry using the antibody DO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unexpected finding raises the possibility of classifying such patients as early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on the basis of their p53 status </plain></SENT>
