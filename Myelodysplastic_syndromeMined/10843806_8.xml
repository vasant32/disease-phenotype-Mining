<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Drosophila kelch protein is a structural component of ring canals and is required for oocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the cloning and genomic structure of a new human homologue of kelch, KLHL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the amino acid level, KLHL3 shares 77% similarity with Drosophila kelch and 89% similarity with Mayven (KLHL2), another human kelch homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approximately 6.5-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 587 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 650 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like kelch and KLHL2, the KLHL3 protein contains a poxvirus and zinc finger domain at the N-terminus and six tandem repeats (kelch repeats) at the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least three isoforms, which differ in the length of the N-terminus, are produced and may be the result of alternative promoter usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also identified alternative polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing; thus, as many as 12 mRNA variants and six putative protein isoforms could be produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The KLHL3 gene is mapped to human chromosome 5, band q31, contains 17 exons, and spans approximately 120 kb of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KLHL3 maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> characterized by a deletion of 5q; however, we detected no inactivating mutations of KLHL3 in malignant myeloid disorders with loss of 5q </plain></SENT>
