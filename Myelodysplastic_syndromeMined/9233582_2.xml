<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven cases were identified by review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic bone marrow specimens with cytogenetics performed at our institution from 1983 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was older (72 years) and diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred, platelet counts were relatively well preserved (median 131 x 10(9)/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mosaic karyotype (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plus abnormal metaphases) was seen in the majority of cases, and survival from diagnosis was short (&lt;2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These features are consistent with data from 30 previously published cases, and support the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 14 occurs as a non-random cytogenetic abnormality in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
