<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related oncoproteins (c-Myc, which enhances, and Bcl-2, which diminishes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) expressed within CD34+ and CD34- marrow cell populations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (n = 24) to determine their potential roles in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hematopoiesis</z:mp> of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marrow cells were permeabilized and CD34+ and CD34- cells were separately analyzed by FACS to detect: (1) a subdiploid (sub-G1) DNA population, and (2) expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoproteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the CD34+ subset, a significantly increased percentage of cells demonstrated apoptotic/sub-G1 DNA content in early (ie. <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (mean values: 9.1% &gt; 2.1% &gt; 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlated with these findings, the ratio of expression of c-Myc to Bcl-2 oncoproteins among CD34+ cells was significantly increased for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> individuals (mean values: 1.6 &gt; 1.2 &gt; 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoprotein levels were maturation stage-dependent, with high levels expressed within CD34+ marrow cells, decreasing markedly with myeloid maturation </plain></SENT>
