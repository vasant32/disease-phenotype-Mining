<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A precise diagnosis is critical, because there is overlap between the clinical and laboratory findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and other malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1518374" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonmalignant hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several prognostic scoring systems (IPSS, WPSS, LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>, and IPSS-R) assess a patient's risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many patients are elderly, so age and comorbidities are an important consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower-risk disease are treated with growth factors (erythropoietin stimulating agents and/or G-CSF) and immunomodulatory agents (antithymocyte globulin and/or lenalidomide) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher-risk disease have a higher risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and are treated with hypomethylating agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation if appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent laboratory studies have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes effecting ribosomes, splicing of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and epigenetics have been discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that these breakthroughs will lead to newer classes of targeted therapies against this disease </plain></SENT>
