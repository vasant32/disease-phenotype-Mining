<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells readily undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to various agents, and the cell line has been suggested as a useful model to study <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to assess differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, to characterize the mode of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these two model systems, and to assess the influence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which in combination with erythropoietin has been shown to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATRA induced differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a concentration- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiated cells were partially rescued (by 50%) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with G-CSF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATRA- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were both mediated through the caspase pathway and were partially blocked with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous treatment with G-CSF and zVAD-fmk additively blocked ATRA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the two pathways differed in terms of substrate cleavage during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ATRA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> caused actin cleavage, which was not affected by G-CSF, and Bcl-2 downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> induced a caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2, while actin remained intact </plain></SENT>
