<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ras mutation was analyzed in 25 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (50%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities at initial analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common cytogenetic aberrations were -7, +8, 5q-, and 20q-, which occurred in 11 (16.2%), seven (10.3%), five (7.4%) and three patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of -7 was higher and that of 5q- lower in our patients than in patients from most other geographic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 17 patients with multiple chromosomal abnormalities had a significantly shorter median survival (9 months) than the 34 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (33 months) and the 17 patients with patients with single anomalies (26 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> occurred in 20 patients (29%) after a median interval of 8 months following the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple cytogenetic changes at initial analysis or in subsequent studies had a significantly higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation than others (55% vs. 18.6%, p = 0.007); the same was not true if only the data of initial study were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial cytogenetic studies are important in patient follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>N-ras mutation was detected in 5 (20%) of 25 patients within the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the gene mutation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But combing the data of N-ras mutation and cytogenetics, patients with either the N-ras mutation or clonal chromosomal abnormalities were at significantly higher risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> than those with neither of the changes (77% vs. 25%) </plain></SENT>
