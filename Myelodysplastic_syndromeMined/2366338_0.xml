<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 80-year-old man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> during the course of follow-up after the surgical operation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the sigmoid colon and the rectum for which no irradiation therapy nor chemotherapy had been applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> was made according to the diagnostic criteria proposed by FAB co-operative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis revealed 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in 54% of the metaphases of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remainders showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype without Ph1 chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was on androgenic steroid and activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">Vitamin D3</z:chebi> without significant changes in the clinical and the hematological features until 3 months later when many atypical blasts appeared in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M2) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis revealed Ph1 chromosome with the typical 9;22 translocation in 100% of the examined cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> was not detected any more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis using bcr probe showed bcr rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>He was treated with a small doses of Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was some reduction in the number of blasts in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, he died of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present case indicates that Ph1 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> with bcr rearrangement is not necessarily considered as a blastic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogeneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and such a cytogenic abnormality can appear in a leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
