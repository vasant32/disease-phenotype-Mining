<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progress on several unresolved issues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> epigenetics will benefit from rapid and standardized methods for profiling DNA methylation genome-wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>) is increasingly used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the clinical efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and the uncertainties about its mode of action, it will be useful to optimize methods for following DNA methylation as a biochemical response in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip-based method (MSNP) for profiling DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this procedure, the extent of demethylation in bone marrow aspirates from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> can be assessed genome-wide using commercially available (Affymetrix) SNP chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We validated the accuracy of MSNP by comparing the results with combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> restriction analysis and by sequencing cloned PCR products from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-converted DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further validated MSNP in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney comparison, comparing the results with methylation-sensitive Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSNP simultaneously detects aberrations in DNA copy number and loss of heterozygosity, making it a generally useful approach for combined genetic and epigenetic profiling in tissue samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
