<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HMBA is currently being studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous phase I trials have demonstrated that HMBA produces hematologic toxicity in morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrows of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of concern that HMBA may produce more severe myelotoxicity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> since these patients have limited hematopoietic reserves, we studied the effects of HMBA on myelodysplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitors in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HMBA concentrations that are optimal for differentiation in vitro (2 to 5 mmol/L) and HMBA concentrations that are being achieved in clinical trials (1 to 2 mmol/L) inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, HMBA did not induce proliferation of myelodysplastic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors at any concentration; rather, it produced nearly identical inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HMBA also produced quantitatively similar inhibition of clonogenic leukemic growth of two myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For a differentiating agent to be effective, it will likely have to either produce both differentiation and proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic progenitors or show selective inhibitory effects on abnormal as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of HMBA cannot be determined from this study, similar inhibitory effects of HMBA on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal hematopoietic progenitors suggest that HMBA may be of limited utility in producing and sustaining elevations of peripheral blood cell counts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
