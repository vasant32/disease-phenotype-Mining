<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We documented the occurrence and severity of dyserythropoiesis as an artifact of storage in bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples were obtained from 7 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specimens were stored at room (20 degrees C-24 degrees C) or refrigerated (1 degrees C-6 degrees C) temperature and examined for dyserythropoiesis at 0, 1, 2, and 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial specimens showed few dyserythropoietic abnormalities; nuclear aberrations occurred in 1.07%+/-0.06% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of the erythroid population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At room temperature, dyserythropoietic changes increased significantly with each day of storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear and cytoplasmic alterations occurred; the former are diagnostically more important in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic changes were more extensive than nuclear abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> percentage of erythroblasts with cytoplasmic vacuoles increased with each day of storage: day 0, 1.1%+/-0.2%; day 1, 22.1%+/-1.8%; day 2, 29.4%+/-2.0%; day 3, 35.6%+/-1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclear shape changes increased to 6.21%+/-1.12%, 11.36%+/-1.12%, and 12.85%+/-1.20% on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 1 day of storage, sufficient dysplastic changes occur to cause difficulty in the diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes are inhibited significantly by refrigerated storage </plain></SENT>
