<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the Rome group reported five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, non-APL) occurring during the course of 77 APL patients (6.5%) in complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1991 to 1998, we treated 677 newly diagnosed cases of APL, and 617 of them achieved CR with ATRA combined to CT (n=579) or CT alone (n=38); 246 of them received subsequent maintenance CT with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6 mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 51 months, 6 patients (0.97%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 13-74 months after the diagnosis of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases, t(15;17) and PML-RARalpha rearrangement were absent at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis, and karyotype mainly showed complex cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and/or 7, typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> observed after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, although none of the six patients had received such agents for the treatment of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can indeed be a long-term complication in APL, although probably at lower incidence than that previously reported </plain></SENT>
