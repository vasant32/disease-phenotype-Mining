<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the donor of the bone marrow transplantation developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We speculate on the presence of an undetectable pre-existing pathological clone in the transplanted bone marrow, which have evolved in the two patients </plain></SENT>
