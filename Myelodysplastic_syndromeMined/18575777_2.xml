<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of Dlk1 was up-regulated in CD34+ cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by analyzing the gene expression profiles determined by microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of Dlk1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> frequently observed higher in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of Dlk1 in transfected K562 cells enhanced proliferation, affected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">As2O3</z:chebi>, and also influenced cell cycle induced by 12-O-tetra decanoylphorbol-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using the same experimental system we found that forced expression of Dlk1 increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of HES1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also inhibited p38 phosphorylation in transfected K562 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigation of the role of Dlk1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hematopoiesis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
