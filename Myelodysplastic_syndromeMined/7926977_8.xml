<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) are two cytokines with erythropoietic inhibitory activity which may be involved in the pathogenesis of some types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that may respond to recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether TNF and IL-1 serum levels are related to clinical response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) receiving r-EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF and IL-1 serum levels were measured by means of immunoenzymatic assays in 26 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and treated with r-EPO administered subcutaneously at dosages up to 1050 U/kg a week, for at least two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients (15%) showed a significant response, with an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &gt; 2 g/dL and complete suspension of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher mean serum levels of both TNF (54.2 +/- 93 vs 4.2 +/- 7.9 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.001) and IL-1 (114 +/- 58.5 vs 36.1 +/- 21.7 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.001) were measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in a group of 42 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, responders showed significantly lower mean levels of TNF (8.2 +/- 9.6 vs 58.5 +/- 65.2 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.05) and IL-1 (30 +/- 24.8 vs 127.8 +/- 51.4 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.001) than those of non responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of absolute values, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responders evidenced undetectable or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of both cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between TNF or IL-1 and values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, serum erythropoietin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor or transfusional requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who respond to r-EPO have lower serum levels of TNF and IL-1 than those who do not respond </plain></SENT>
