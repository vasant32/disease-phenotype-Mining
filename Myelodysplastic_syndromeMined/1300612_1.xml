<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on trephine biopsies of the bone marrow in 52 patients (28 males/24 females; age 68 years) with various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to determine the number of macrophages (phagocytic-histiocytic reticular cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantifications included the haemosiderin-storing subpopulation (<z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian-blue</z:chebi> reaction) of this lineage as well as the iron-free compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter was identified by a new monoclonal antibody (PG-M1) which is specifically directed against histiocytic reticular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow specimens of individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> and those showing reactive lesions served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and inflammatory changes (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>) 23 of the 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> revealed a significant increase in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase encompassed not only the iron-laden subpopulation but also the total number of phagocytic reticular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of macrophages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was speculated to be due to a premature and enforced degradation of dysplastic cell elements leading to phagocytosis of haemosiderin and debris material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cells of the monocyte-macrophage system could be involved in the complex pathomechanism of fibrillogenesis, since in a considerable percentage of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, an increase in reticulin (argyrophilic) fibres was noticeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding of an expansion of the macrophage compartment in about half of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is in keeping with results of cell culture studies on colony formation of granulocyte-macrophage precursors (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
