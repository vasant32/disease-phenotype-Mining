<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the work is to introduce the principle of comet assay to the medical community and to give a basic survey of its possible clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The article includes our first experience with this method in detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in bone marrow cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The whole bone marrow aspirates from 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 7 control persons were processed by alkaline version of comet assay and the degree of DNA fragmentation in individual cells was quantified using Image Analysis System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison with controls, the patients with diagnosis RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> exhibited in bone marrow significantly elevated number of cells with high level of DNA breaks, reflecting most probably the apoptotic cleavage of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patient in proliferative stage of the disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>--&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) exhibited decreased frequency of apoptotic cells, well below the control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results correspond with the data published on the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in particular types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comet assay represents a simple and cheap technique, applicable in clinical hematology to specify the diagnosis, to monitor the disease progress and efficacy of therapy not only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but also in other diseases resulting from an imbalance between proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
