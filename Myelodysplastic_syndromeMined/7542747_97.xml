<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> the maturation of myeloid progenitor cells is arrested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> develop in some patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in the signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may play a part in the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We isolated genomic DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from hematopoietic cells obtained from two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and histories of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Murine myeloid 32D.C10 cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses to G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutations, a substitution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> at the codon for glutamine at position 718 (Gln718) in one patient and at the codon for glutamine at position 731(Gln731) in the other, caused a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genes for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage, before the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 32D.C10 cells expressing mutant receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when cultured in G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C10 cells that coexpressed the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> and associated with the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
