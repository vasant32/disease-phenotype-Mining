<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined chromosomes and molecular aberrations in 21 patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed abnormal karyotypes, and chromosomal losses of No. 5 and/or No. 7 (-5/5q- and/or -7/7q-) were identified in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these 12, six patients (50%) harbored a TP53 mutation, and two of five examined showed microsatellite instability, suggesting replication error (RER+) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, among the other nine patients without -5/5q- and/or -7/7q-, none harbored a TP53 mutation, and none of five examined showed RER+ phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, TP53 mutations and RER+ phenotype were preferentially associated with specific chromosomal losses in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then screened for mutational events in representative DNA mismatch repair genes; exons 5-7 and 12-15 of the hMSH2 gene and exon 9 of hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, two unrelated patients showing RER+ phenotype had an identical missense alteration at codon 419 of hMSH2 in their marrow cells and fibroblasts, which were not found in 120 DNA samples from healthy volunteers or patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this study revealed a possible relationship of RER+ phenotype accompanying an hMSH2 alteration to the development of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> in association with TP53 mutations and specific chromosomal losses, and suggests that some patients may be predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> after chemotherapy for their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
