<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the cost effectiveness of posaconazole vs. standard azoles for the prevention of IFIs in neutropenic patients in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using data from a randomized trial that compared posaconazole and standard azole (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>) prophylaxis in neutropenic patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> (Cornely et al., N Engl J Med 2007;356:348-359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following initiation of prophylaxis, clinical events are modeled with chance nodes reflecting probabilities of IFIs, IFI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients surviving the prophylaxis are assumed to have a life expectancy according to the underlying condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allows translation of the trial outcomes to a lifetime horizon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on life expectancy, quality of life, medical resource consumption and costs were obtained from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Model outcomes include cost per life year (LY) gained and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total cost (treatment of breakthrough IFI + prophylaxis) for posaconazole amounted to 4412 euros (95% uncertainty interval 3403 euros - 5666 euros), which is -183 euros (-1985 euros to 1564 euros) less than costs with standard azoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in 0.08 (0.02-0.15) QALYs gained in comparison with prophylaxis with standard azoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 90% probability that the cost per QALY gained with posaconazole is below 20,000 euros </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional scenario analyzes with different assumptions confirmed these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the underlying data and assumptions, the economic evaluation demonstrated that posaconazole prophylaxis is expected to be cost-effective compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> in neutropenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
