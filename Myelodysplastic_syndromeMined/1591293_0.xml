<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of these agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> poses novel opportunities and challenges due to their direct effects on the neoplastic cells, which represent the transformed counterparts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction between hematopoietic growth factors and leukemic progenitor cells bearing a specific receptor for a given agent would be expected to result in proliferation, although maturation induction could occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic growth factors have been employed as primary differentiating agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and as supportive agents after chemotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In either case, close monitoring for evidence of leukemic stimulation is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, pretreatment with colony-stimulating factors could induce cell cycling, thereby making the leukemic cells more susceptible to S-phase-specific chemotherapeutic agents, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
