<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that RIC HCT using UCB would be safe and efficacious in older patients, and compared the treatment-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) of RIC HCT in patients older than 55 years using either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> (n = 47) or, in patients with no 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 HLA compatible related donors, UCB (n = 43) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up for survivors was 27 (range: 12-61) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3-year probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS; 30% versus 34%, P = .98) and OS (43% versus 34%, P = .57) were similar for recipients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and UCB </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, graft type had no impact on TRM or survival, and the HCT comorbidity index score was the only factor independently predictive for these endpoints </plain></SENT>
