<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the population and help generate etiologic hypotheses, we assessed potential clustering in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the state of Connecticut using population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry data that recently became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant spatial clustering was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most likely area with a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> included 46 census tracts near the west border of Connecticut, and the ratio of observed/expected cases was 2.84 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P value associated with this cluster was 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no temporal clustering was indicated, a space-time analysis identified a cluster in the central south of Connecticut from March 2002 through August 2003 (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first analysis of potential clustering in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using population-based data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the intriguing finding on spatial clustering is supported by future studies with larger sample sizes and/or in other geographic areas, it would be extremely interesting to explore the "causes" of clustering, which may help shed light on the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
