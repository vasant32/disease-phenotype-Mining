<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the expression and epigenetic modification of this gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) that belongs to the myelodysplastic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>) with a high proportion of blastic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of bone marrow trephines in a series of 33 CMML cases showed an aberrant p15(INK4b) gene methylation in up to 58% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation was analyzed employing different methylation-specific PCR and genomic sequencing protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It turned out to be spread over a broad area of the 5' region and exhibited substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between cases and even in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of aberrant methylation was correlated with a reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as reduced protein expression, and was associated with a higher expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT 3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that aberrant gene methylation is a frequent event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> that might contribute to the pathogenesis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
