<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), five had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their bone marrow cells exhibited tri-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and morphological abnormalities in eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics revealed major karyotype abnormalities (MAKA) in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival durations were significantly shorter than those of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is strongly related to the coexistence of MAKA </plain></SENT>
