<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While the therapeutic activity of the deoxycytidine analogue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> is thought to reflect its ability to reactivate methylation-silenced genes, this agent is also known to trigger p53-dependent DNA damage responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that p53-inducible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase (p53R2/RRM2B) is a robust transcriptional target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment induces p53R2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, protein expression, and promoter activity in a p53-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of p53R2 gene induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> does not seem to be promoter DNA hypomethylation, as the p53R2 5' CpG island is hypomethylated before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) targeting of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 cells leads to genomic DNA hypomethylation but does not induce p53R2, suggesting that DNMT/DNA adduct formation is the molecular trigger for p53R2 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this idea, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi>-based DNMT inhibitors that form covalent DNA adducts induce p53R2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>siRNA targeting of p53R2 reduces the extent of cell cycle arrest following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment, supporting a functional role for p53R2 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>-mediated cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical relevance of p53R2 induction, we measured p53R2 expression in bone marrow samples from 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53R2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were induced in 7 of 13 (54%) and 6 of 9 (67%) patients analyzed, respectively, despite a lack of methylation changes in the p53R2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most notably, there was a significant association (P = 0.0047) between p53R2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction and clinical response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data establish p53R2 as a novel hypomethylation-independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> gene target associated with clinical response </plain></SENT>
