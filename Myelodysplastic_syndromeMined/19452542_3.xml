<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Response and survival in 96 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) who received aggressive induction chemotherapy was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The median follow-up of survivors was 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 (73%) patients achieved a morphologic complete remission (CR) confirmed by absence of leukemic blasts by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 96 patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 8 months, and overall survival (OS) was 13.6 months (range, 1-119 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients died shortly after induction therapy because of disease or side effects, and 13 are currently in continuous first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival (DFS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 70 patients who achieved a morphologic CR was 9 months (range, 1-51 months), with a 64% chance of surviving 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy had a higher morphologic remission rate compared with those arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> (82% vs 62%; P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, among the patients from the 2 groups who attained a morphologic remission, there was no difference in terms of CR rate (P = .94), DFS, EFS, or OS (P = .55, .83, and .71, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a similar DFS to the group of 7 patients who went directly to ablative allogeneic transplant rather than having induction therapy first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this population of patients who received aggressive chemotherapy, Charlson comorbidity index or a higher number of factors recognized as high risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients did not affect the chance of OS, DFS, and EFS, although having more recognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> risk factors was related to a lower chance of surviving 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to note that those with higher comorbidity indexes were underrepresented in this aggressively treated cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrate that many patients with sAML can tolerate aggressive induction therapy and attain remission, but duration of response and the chance of long-term survival remain poor </plain></SENT>
