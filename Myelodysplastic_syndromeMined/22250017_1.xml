<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) to identify previously cryptic chromosomal abnormalities such as copy number alterations and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> (UPD) in cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the aberrant regions, we attempted to localize candidate genes with potential relevance to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using SNP-A, we analyzed peripheral blood granulocytes from 37 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis identified 13 cryptic chromosomal defects in 10 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four UPD (affecting chromosomes 3q, 7q, 17q, and 20p), 5 deletions and 4 duplications were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression data measured on CD34+ cells were available for 4 patients with and 6 patients without SNP-A lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We performed an integrative analysis of genotyping and gene expression microarrays and found several genes with an altered expression located in the aberrant regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression microarrays suggested BMP2 and TRIB3 located in 20p UPD as potential candidate genes contributing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed that the genome-wide integrative approach is beneficial to the comprehension of molecular backgrounds of diseases with incompletely understood etiopathology </plain></SENT>
