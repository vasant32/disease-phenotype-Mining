<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed on 235 elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients aged 60 years or more, consecutively admitted to a single haematological department during a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>46% of patients received only conventional induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of inclusion in EORTC cooperative clinical trials was significantly lower than for younger patients despite specific protocols proposed for the elderly since 1983, thus confirming the important selection bias of most published series on elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with treatment results in patients &lt; 60 years, complete remission (CR) rate was lower (33.3% v 65.4%, P &lt; 0.0001), with a marked drop in patients older than 70, and induction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was higher (21.3% v 12.5%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic characteristics of leukaemic cells, especially expression of the MDR1 gene, in vitro growth of the leukaemic clonogenic cells and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>-(+)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, did not differ according to age, except that there was a higher incidence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and a lower incidence of good prognostic cytogenetics in the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, treatment failure in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients appears to be mainly due to host-related factors (especially performance status and age &lt; or &gt; or = 70 years), and to inadequate treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some elderly patients may have been undertreated because of the planned <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose reduction, resulting in a higher rate of 'resistant' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, i.e. patients surviving the induction period without entering into CR, than in younger patients (45.4% v 22.1%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11 patients (4.7%) with untreated or 'resistant' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> survived more than 1 year, while receiving only supportive care </plain></SENT>
