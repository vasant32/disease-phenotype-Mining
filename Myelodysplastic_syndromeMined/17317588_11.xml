<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The affect of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> on outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis in 471 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 113 with and 358 without marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, who received myeloablative allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-HCT follow-up was 0.3-10 years (median, 3.6 years) for patients with, and 0.6-12 years (median, 5 years) for patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was significantly delayed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.4; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant differences in overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) between patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, among patients with advanced disease (int-2 or high-risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System), OS (P = .03), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (P = .04), and NRM (P = .04) were inferior when marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given that marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is a poor prognostic factor for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that it does not appear to affect outcome of transplantation in patients with earlier-stage disease but has a negative impact on outcome for patients with advanced disease, patients with earlier-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> might be considered for HCT earlier than their disease stage would normally dictate </plain></SENT>
