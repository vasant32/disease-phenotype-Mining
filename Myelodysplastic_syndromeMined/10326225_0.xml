<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Vepesid</z:chebi>, the first bone marrow transplantation was performed using 3.53 x 10(6)/kg of CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial engraftment was followed by graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second conditioning consisted of melphalan and anti-thymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The boy was then transplanted with 5.15 x 10(6)/kg of CD34+ cells, harvested from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relapse occurred on day +140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At that time NK cells decreased from 20 to 7% with the lowest CD4+/CD8+ ratio, 0.07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Just after relapse, the percentage of cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK-CD3+CD56+) dropped from 3.34 to 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CsA treatment was stopped and the patient received T cell (CD3+ cells) add-back four times on days +146, +199, +234, and +262 in doses of 0.5 x 10(5), 1.0 x 10(5), 2.0 x 10(5), and 4.0 x 10(5)/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of lymphocyte subsets before the fourth add-back showed the highest values of CD4+, NK, and CIK cells and also the highest CD4+/CD8+ ratio </plain></SENT>
