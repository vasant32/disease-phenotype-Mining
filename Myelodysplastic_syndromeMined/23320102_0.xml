<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vorinostat is a HDACi which has produced responses in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to address the functional effects of vorinostat in leukemic cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> myeloid cells and to dissect the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which it exerts its action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Functional assays showed vorinostat promoted cell cycle arrest, inhibited growth, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation of K562, HL60 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 and of CD33(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore the genetic mechanism for these effects, we quantified gene expression modulation by vorinostat in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vorinostat increased expression of genes down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (cFOS, COX2, IER3, p15, RAI3) and suppressed expression of genes over-expressed in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (AXL, c-MYC, Cyclin D1) and modulated cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> genes in a manner which would favor cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neoplastic cells, consistent with the functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reporter assays showed transcriptional effect of vorinostat on some of these genes was mediated by proximal promoter elements in GC-rich regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vorinostat-modulated expression of some genes was potentiated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31856">mithramycin</z:chebi> A, a compound that interferes with SP1 binding to GC-rich DNA sequences, and siRNA-mediated SP1 reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ChIP assays revealed vorinostat inhibited DNA binding of SP1 to the proximal promoter regions of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest vorinostat transcriptional action in some genes is regulated by proximal promoter GC-rich DNA sequences and by SP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the effects of vorinostat in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and supports the implementation of clinical trials to explore the use of vorinostat in the treatment of these diseases </plain></SENT>
