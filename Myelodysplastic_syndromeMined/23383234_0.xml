<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process involves de novo formation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation of the adult stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The T3-dependence of the formation of adult intestinal stem cell during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to identify genes likely important for adult organ-specific stem cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have cloned and characterized the ectopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration site 1 (EVI) and its variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/EVI generated via transcription from the upstream <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> promoter and alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/EVI have been implicated in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including breast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, ovarian, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that EVI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/EVI transcripts are upregulated by T3 in the epithelium but not the rest of the intestine in Xenopus laevis when adult stem cells are forming in the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that EVI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/EVI are likely involved in the development and/or proliferation of newly forming adult intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
