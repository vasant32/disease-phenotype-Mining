<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first treatment, 68 patients were randomised to receive two cycles of ETI (n = 36) or TAI (n = 32) and thereafter maintenance with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 92 patients, 52 (57%) achieved remission at some stage </plain></SENT>
