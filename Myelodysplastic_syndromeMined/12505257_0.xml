<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different types of SKY's cytogenetic contributions include confirmation of G-banding results, identification of partially characterized rearrangements, identification of marker chromosomes unidentified by G-banding, and detection of cryptic reciprocal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the ability of SKY to clarify a number of markers led to the comprehension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The common aberration found in these two t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases was the fragility of chromosome 5 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We clearly present that the use of SKY combined with conventional G-banding analysis and FISH has assisted in the identification of important chromosomal events that may play a key role in the development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
