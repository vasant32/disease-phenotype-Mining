<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow trephines from 31 patients with an initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were examined and analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In those cases terminating in overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (6/31, 19%), the number of bone marrow mast cells was significantly reduced, compared with those which did not evolve to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow lymphoid cells that may participate in immunosurveillance against the proliferation of blast cells were also significantly reduced in cases terminating in overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, S-100 protein-positive cells, which include histiocytes and suppressor T-cells, were increased in cases terminating in overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that examination of the bone marrow to determine the proportions of mast cells and lymphoid cells which may be involved in host defense systems may be useful in predicting the evolution to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present series, patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> (5/31, 16%) did not progress to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and had a significantly lower bone marrow reticulin content, a significantly lower megakaryocyte count, a relatively higher mast cell count and a significantly higher lymphoid cell count than those with a normocellular or hypercellular marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings may reflect the initial features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or, possibly, that hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is an independent entity with a low potential for blastic proliferation </plain></SENT>
