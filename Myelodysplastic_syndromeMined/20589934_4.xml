<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether copy number alterations (CNAs) are present that may contribute to disease development and/or progression of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 36 pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed using array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, the most frequent chromosome aberration in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, novel recurrent CNAs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included a loss of 3p14.3-p12.3, which contains the putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene FHIT, a loss of 7p21.3-p15.3, a loss of 9q33.3-q34.3 (D184) and microdeletions in 17p11.2, 6q23 containing MYB, and 17p13 containing TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this small patient cohort, patients without CNA, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 only and patients with one CNA in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 did not differ in their survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with complex karyotypes, including two patients with deletions of TP53, died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A challenge inherent to aCGH analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is the low percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated several approaches to overcome this limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genomic profiles from isolated granulocytes were of higher quality than those from bone marrow mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased breakpoint calling stringency increased recognition of CNAs present in small clonal populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further analysis using a custom-designed array showed that these CNAs often did not confirm the findings from 244k arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, constitutional CNVs were reliably detected on both arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aCGH on amplified DNA from distinct myeloid clusters is a new approach to determine CNAs in small subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly emphasize the need to verify array-CGH results by independent methods like FISH or quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
