<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NUP98 gene on chromosome band 11p15 is involved in several different chromosomal aberrations that have been associated with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the translocation breakpoints from two cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> harboring a t(11;20)(p15;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the breakpoints from both cases revealed almost perfectly balanced translocations between NUP98 and TOP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no known recombinogenic sequences identified at or near the breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, four bp microduplications present at the translocation crossover points suggested that these translocations may have been initiated by 4 bp staggered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> breaks, which are known to be associated with the action of topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the history of patient exposure to topoisomerase II poisons, and the fact that these drugs stabilize staggered breaks with a 4 bp overhang, it seems possible that drug-induced topoisomerase II cleavage and subunit exchange was involved in these translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NUP98 is a recurrent target for therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> induced by multiagent chemotherapy, and suggest a role for DNA topoisomerase II poisons in the generation of these translocations </plain></SENT>
