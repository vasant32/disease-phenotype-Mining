<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A geriatric home visit program of a community-based teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Non-institutionalized elderly patients referred to the geriatric home visit program from March 1, 2003, through October 1, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, diagnostic, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> data were abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was defined using the WHO criteria of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 244 patients, predominantly white (88%), women (77%), and with a median age of 85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> prevalence was 39.6% (95% CI: 32.6-46.9): 44.7% (95% CI: 30.2-59.9) in the men and 37.9% (95% CI: 30.0-46.4%) in the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> prevalence by race, known diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or by any other comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Majorities (86.8%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> were normocytic, 10.5% were microcytic, and 2.6% had <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 36.4% had nutrient deficiencies, 13.6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, 9.1% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and the etiology remained unknown for 40.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> prevalence in the homebound geriatric population is high, about 4 times the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) estimate for the free-living, community-dwelling elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It mirrors the high prevalence in the nursing home population </plain></SENT>
