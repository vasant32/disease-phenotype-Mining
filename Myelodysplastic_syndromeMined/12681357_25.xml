<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The constitutive expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TNF receptors (TNFR), including TNFRI and TNFRII, and the adapter molecules, such as the TNF receptor-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain protein (TRADD), Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain protein (FADD), receptor interacting protein (RIP) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) were analyzed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in bone marrow samples from control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) patients, there was a significant increase in TNFRI expression as compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of TNFRII was also up-regulated in RA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases revealed increased expression of TNFRII, whereas the expression of TNFRI was comparable to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the TNFRI, as well as TNFRII of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow was expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells, but not in macrophage-lineage stromal cells at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased constitutive expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TRADD, FADD and RIP and decreased expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TRAF-2 were observed in bone marrow cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, especially from RA patients, as compared with controls, although the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In many of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> bone marrow samples, strong expression of TRAF-2 mRNA was marked, while expression levels of other proteins were similar to those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggested enhanced signaling by the TNFRI-TRADD-FADD pathway and suppressed signaling by the TRAF-2 pathway in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, TNF-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play a role in ineffective hematopoiesis in "early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>" bone marrow, although the regulatory mechanisms for TNF-alpha-induced signaling would be complicated and not be simply explained only by these pathways </plain></SENT>
