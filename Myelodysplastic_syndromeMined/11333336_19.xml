<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present two cases of severe dry eye in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (CGVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) who were successfully treated by the systemic administration of FK506 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 29-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> underwent SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral and lung CGVHD developed on approximately day 130, and dry eye associated with CGVHD was diagnosed on day 168 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient began receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (150 mg/d) for the treatment of oral and lung CGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/d) began on approximately day 300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral and lung GVHD improved slightly, but worsened again although systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> were continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> was discontinued, and systemic administration of FK506 was started on day 376 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four days later, marked improvement in the ocular surface and other organs was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the dry eye worsened while tapering FK506, with no flare of other affected organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> underwent SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She received FK506 for prophylaxis of CGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She had mild dry eye before SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oral and intestinal CGVHD developed, and the dry eye worsened significantly on approximately day 150 while tapering FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/d) began, and the dose of FK506 was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By day 240, the symptoms of dry eye and the findings of the ocular surface markedly improved, and CGVHD in other organs was completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the improvement in the dry eye was lost when FK506 was tapered for the second time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of FK506 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> is an effective treatment of severe dry eye in patients with CGVHD, but long-term administration may be required to achieve a lasting response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These cases also suggest that further investigation into the use of topical FK506 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> as a maintenance therapy should be pursued </plain></SENT>
