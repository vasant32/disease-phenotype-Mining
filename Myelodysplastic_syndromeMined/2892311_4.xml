<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study includes nine patients with a megakaryoblastic crisis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (AM) and three with myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> later evolving into overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison and statistical evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> reaction with anti-factor VIII staining reveals that the latter technique not only facilitates the recognition of immature and abnormal megakaryocytes, but leads to a significantly increased count for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> megakaryocytic elements in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus our retrospective investigation of routinely processed and paraffin-embedded trephine biopsies shows that the diagnosis of a megakaryoblastic crisis in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> as well as AM may be easily established with the aid of the anti-factor VIII method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of megakaryoblastic proliferation in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and AM, the appearance of blasts was associated with moderate to pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> which could be also determined by morphometry </plain></SENT>
