<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MUTZ-1 cells were pretreated with 2-ME; then the activity of caspases-3 was determined by fluorescent colorimetry; the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes (mcl-1) and bcl-2-related X protein (bax) were determined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that as compared with control, the 2-ME enhanced the activity of caspase-3 in MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manners (p&lt;0.05); along with increasing of 2-ME concentration, the expression of intracellular mcl-1 mRNA reduced (p&lt;0.05), meanwhile the expression level of mcl-1 mRNA negatively correlated to the activity of caspase-3 at the corresponding time points (r=-0.992, p&lt;0.01), but the expression of bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> did not show significant change (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that 2-ME can regulate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells through the pathway of down-regulating the expression of mcl-1 mRNA and activating the caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
