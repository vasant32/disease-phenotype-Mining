<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations in c-Kit, the receptor for Stem Cell Factor (SCF), have been identified in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> of the mast cell lineage and have been shown to contribute to transformation in model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early myeloid cells also normally express c-Kit and their survival, proliferation and differentiation is promoted by SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It might therefore be expected that c-Kit mutations could also be involved in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found that mutant c-Kit (and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-Kit in the presence of SCF) provides a strong differentiation stimulus in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and immortalised murine early myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since maturation of haemopoietic cells, with the exception of mast cells, results in down-regulation of c-Kit expression, the transforming effects of mutant receptor may be self-limiting in most lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the observation that multipotential progenitor cells from some patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> express mutant c-Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, c-Kit mutations have been observed in a few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without mast cell features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Oncogenesis</z:e> involves multiple genetic changes and the phenotype of malignant haemopoietic cells expressing mutant c-Kit may be influenced by co-oncogenic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example mutations blocking the differentiative effect of mutant c-Kit might result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the extent to which c-Kit mutations contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of early myeloid phenotype remains unknown, and resolution of this issue is complicated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this family of diseases </plain></SENT>
