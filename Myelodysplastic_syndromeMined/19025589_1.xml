<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can potentially cure some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, patients who undergo HSCT experience <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few studies on the short-term influence of HSCT on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 71 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> who underwent HSCT: 33 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, nine with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 10 with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Psychological distress</z:e> was assessed prior to HSCT and on the seventh day after HSCT using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With regard to Anger-Hostility, the interaction of time (pre- and post-HSCT) and group (the four groups) was significant in male patients (p = 0.04), but not in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the other subscales of POMS, there was no significant main effect or interaction in male or female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It may be important to provide psychological support to patients throughout the period of HSCT in consideration of differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001575'>mood changes</z:hpo> associated with the underlying disease and patient sex in order to provide efficient psychiatric intervention for both better psychiatric and survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
