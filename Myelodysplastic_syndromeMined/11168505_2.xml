<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variable and sometimes low response rate to rHuEpo treatment raises the question whether the existence of autoantibodies against erythropoietin (epo) is partially responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the presence of anti-epo autoantibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 13 had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 3 had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 9 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation and 2 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were divided in 3 groups according to rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A consisted of 10 patients who did not receive rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group B included 13 patients who were on rHuEpo treatment (150 IU/kg subcutaneously, 3 times weekly) showing an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) values or reduction of transfusion requirements and Group C consisted of 20 patients who did not respond or stopped responding to rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies consisted of a complete blood cell count, measurement of serum epo and determination of anti-epo antibodies using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences with regard to age and sex among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No autoantibodies against epo were found in the examined sera, apart from a female patient from group A who showed a low positive titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that anti-epo autoantibodies do not contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and are not responsible for the modest response to rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to identify possible reasons for the low response rate to rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
