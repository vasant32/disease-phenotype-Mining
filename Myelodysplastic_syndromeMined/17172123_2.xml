<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 1997 to Sep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2004, a total of 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with allo-HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On HSCT, 4 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) , 2 RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) , 7 RA with excess blasts(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) , 14 RAEB in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) , 3 already progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For IPSS system, 6 patients were in intermediate- I risk group, 11 in intermediate- li risk group, and 13 in high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modified BU/CY conditioning regimen was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 8 received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) , and 18 received BMT + PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year expected overall survival (OS) was 63.61%, 3-year expected disease-free survival ( DFS) 61.41%, and relapse rate 5.26%; OS for RA/ <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subgroup was 83.33%, 34.29% and 66.67% , respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had no statistic difference among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS for IPSS-intermediate and high risk subgroup was 64.7% , and 69.0% respectively, also had no statistic difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3-year expected OS in no aGVHD,grade I - II aGVHD and grade III - IV aGVHD group was 57.75% , 100% and 0% , respectively (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-HSCT chemotherapy, disease subtype and cGVHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had no correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> or OS (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients having HLA-identical sibling donors, HSCT should be the first line therapy and performed as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
