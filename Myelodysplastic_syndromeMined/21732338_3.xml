<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and rituximab (FCR) has produced promising results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report the final results from a multicenter, prospective study examining FCR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005508'>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia</z:hpo> (WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients with symptomatic WM that was untreated or pretreated with 1 line of chemotherapy received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 250 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 2 through 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCR was repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 79%, and the major response rate of 74.4%, including 11.6% complete remissions (CRs) and 20.9% very good partial remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An amelioration of the quality of responses was observed during follow-up, leading to 18.6% of CRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in terms of responses were observed among previously treated or untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the clinical and laboratory features that were considered, only the Î²2-microglobulin level had a significant impact in terms of achieving a major response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity reported was grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, which occurred in 45% of courses and was the main reason for treatment discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the end of treatment, 19 patients (44%) had long-lasting episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FCR regimen was capable of neutralizing adverse prognostic factors and proved to be active in patients with WM, leading to rapid disease control and good-quality responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> was the main concern, further studies are warranted to optimize dosages and treatment duration </plain></SENT>
