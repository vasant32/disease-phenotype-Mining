<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the medical and financial effects of discharge immediately after chemotherapy completion with close outpatient follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 12 months, 15 patients fulfilling both medical and logistical criteria were discharged early, whereas 5 patients meeting medical criteria only served as inpatient controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients discharged early spent a median of 8 days (range 3-36 days), or 54% of their study time, as outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients required less time on intravenous antibiotics (6 vs. 16 days; P=0.11), received fewer red blood cell transfusions (0.25 vs. 0.48 units/day; P=0.08), and incurred lower median daily charges ($3,270 vs. $5,467; P=0.01) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, early discharge of selected patients appears, safe and may reduce cost and resource utilization </plain></SENT>
