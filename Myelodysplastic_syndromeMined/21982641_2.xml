<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A working group within the Dutch Society of Cytometry aimed to implement FC in the diagnostic work-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hereto, guidelines for data acquisition, analysis and interpretation were formulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on discussions on analyses of list mode data files and fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow samples and recent literature, the guidelines were modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the years (2005-2011), the concordance between the participating centers increased indicating that the proposed guidelines contributed to a more objective, standardized FC analysis, thereby ratifying the implementation of FC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
