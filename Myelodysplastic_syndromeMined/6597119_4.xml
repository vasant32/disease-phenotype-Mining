<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P39/Tsugane cells were characterized by blastic appearance, presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">NaF</z:chebi>-sensitive alpha-naphthyl butylate esterase activity, Fc gamma-receptor, C3-receptor, capacity to phagocytize sensitized erythrocytes, and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies such as OKT4, My4, VIMD5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>-2 and My7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that P39/Tsugane cells are of myelomonocytoid nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P39/Tsugane had a hypodiploid chromosome constitution with a gain of a consistent marker, 6q+, the presence of less consistent markers 9q+ and rcp(14;16), and random and non-random losses of autosomes: in accordance with the reported cytogenetic profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a representative karyotype of the present cell line is 45,XY,+del(6)(q15),9q+, t(14;16)-(q24;q21),-16,-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P39/Tsugane cells were transplantable intraperitoneally into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, and produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that P39/Tsugane is the first cultured cell line of myelomonocytoid nature to be derived from overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, P39/Tsugane cells should be useful for studies on the differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in vitro-in vivo experimental chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
