<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median time from initial therapy to development of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 71 months (range, 7 to 331 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was hematologic in 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presentation occurred in 57 patients (51%), 55% of whom subsequently transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were documented in marrow specimens from 70 of 89 patients with analyzable metaphases (79%; 69% of the total group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with 34 patients with metachronous secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> without prior chemotherapy or irradiation, those with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> exhibited a significantly higher frequency of abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 (43% v 18%), and lower incidence of diploid karyotypes (18% v 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were also significantly higher in patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, procarbazine, and nitrosoureas (72% to 83%), compared with those who had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-based regimens (29%), other chemotherapies (14%), or irradiation alone (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival from diagnosis of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly shorter for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presentation (21 v 45 weeks); in the latter category, it was similar whether evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> occurred or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 72 patients treated with antileukemia therapy, 29% achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated the cytogenetic pattern to be the most important characteristic determining remission rate and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other important prognostic features were the morphologic presentation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> v <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) for probability of achieving remission, and patient age and marrow blasts percentage for survival </plain></SENT>
