<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a mouse bone marrow transplantation model, a RUNX1 mutant, D171N, was shown to collaborate with Evi1 in the development of MDSs; however, this is rare in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using enforced expression in human CD34(+) cells, we showed that the D171N mutant, the most frequent target of mutation in the RUNX1 gene, had an increased self-renewal capacity, blocked differentiation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 lineages, and tendency for immaturity, but no proliferation ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI1 overexpression was observed in CD34(+) cells from the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with RUNX1 mutations, but not in D171N-transduced human CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cotransduction of D171N and BMI1 demonstrated that BMI1 overexpression conferred proliferation ability to D171N-transduced cells in both human CD34(+) cells and a mouse bone marrow transplantation model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise transduction of D171N followed by BMI1 in human CD34(+) cells resulted in long-term proliferation with a retained CD34(+) cell fraction, which is quite similar to the phenotype in patients with higher-risk MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that BMI1 overexpression is one of the second hit partner genes of RUNX1 mutations that contribute to the development of MDSs </plain></SENT>
