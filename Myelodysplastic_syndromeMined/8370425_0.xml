<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a randomised multicentre trial a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, lomustine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and melphalan (MOCCA) was compared with the same regimen omitting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> after the first course (COLA) in previously untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MOCCA arm showed a response rate of 72% among 79 patients and the COLA arm a response rate of 60% among 59 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 56 months in the MOCCA arm and 61 months in the COLA arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a slight increase of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (within the first 6 months) in the MOCCA arm as compared with the COLA arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in multidrug therapies, the continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> at conventional dosage beyond the first course does not improve response rate or survival time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
