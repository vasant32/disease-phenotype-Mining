<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of TTNPB or RA to culture plates containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient's marrow cells stimulated myeloid colony (CFU-C) growth and caused a significant increase in granulocytic colonies (CFU-G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of RA the increase in CFU-G was statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular differentiation studies in liquid suspension culture revealed that the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> analogues cause a marked decrease in immature granulocytes and an increase in mature granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was further an increase in the number of cells that reacted positively with monoclonal antibodies (McAb) binding specifically to granulocytes (B4,3,B13,9 and Leu M4) and a decrease in the percentage of cells reacting with the McAb against Ia-like determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that TTNPB is as active as RA in stimulating the growth of hemopoietic progenitors from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and in enhancing granulocytic differentiation in liquid culture </plain></SENT>
