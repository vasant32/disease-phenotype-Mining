<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More data may contribute to resolution of this complex issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 378 primary allogeneic transplants with T-replete grafts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 101), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 149), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort was divided into 3 groups: in group 1, HLA class I matched at the antigen level (n = 260); in group 2, HLA class I mismatched at the antigen level (n = 57); and in group 3, HLA class I and iKIRLs mismatched (n = 61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-year overall survival (OS) across groups 1 (59%), 2 (49%), and 3 (30%) was significantly different (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to group 2, group 3 had statistically lower OS (P = .05) and event-free survival (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse and relapse-free mortality appeared to contribute to the low OS in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detrimental effect of natural killer alloreactivity was also evident when HLA-matched transplants were analyzed for patients lacking iKIRLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-year OS in patients lacking the HLA-Cw group 1 or 2 iKIRL was significantly lower than that in patients having the iKIRLs (55% vs 67%, n = 246, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that, in T-replete unrelated HCT, iKIRL mismatches and the absence of iKIRLs confer higher risk to patients after HCT </plain></SENT>
