<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effects of rIFN-gamma on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors from 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who were treated with rIFN-gamma (0.01 mg/m2 given subcutaneously three times a week) as part of an Italian pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When bone marrow cells were cultured in semisolid medium in the continuous presence of rIFN-gamma (10-10(4) U/ml), inhibition of colony formation was the most common response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, an enhancement of hematopoietic progenitor growth was observed in one patient at the lowest concentration tested (10 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of bone marrow mononuclear cells with low concentrations of rIFN-gamma in suspension culture for 5 days induced or enhanced in vitro colony formation in two cases; again, higher concentrations resulted in inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed a slight improvement of in vitro progenitor growth after one month of treatment with rIFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although preliminary, these data indicate that rIFN-gamma may have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on myelodysplastic hematopoiesis, depending on both the effective concentrations and the interactions with accessory cells </plain></SENT>
