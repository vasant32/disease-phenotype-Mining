<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Bone marrow (BM) clonal cells (which had cytogenetic markers detected by FISH assay) and blasts were quantitatively analysed in 51 MDS and 11 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clonal cell percentage in orthochromatic normoblasts, granulocytes and megakaryocytes were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biological functions for phagocytosis and oxidation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils were compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients BM had a higher clonal cell percentage (mean 48.2%) than blasts percentage (mean 6.7%) (P &lt; 0.01), but with the subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> advancing this percentage gap was closing up, and in 11 AML patients no such gap was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gap in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with + 8 abnormality was smaller than in those with 5q - </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BM, clonal cells were detected in segmented granulocytes (mean 45.9%), orthochromatic normoblasts (mean 46.0%) and mature megakaryocytes (mean 38.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Addition, an approximate amount of clonal cells with the same karyotype abnormality in BM were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> PB (mean 37.3% in blood vs 48.6% in marrow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis showed that the neutrophils in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> PB could exert nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological functions (P &gt; 0.05), but those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> could not as compared to healthy donors (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference in the biological features between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> clonal cells </plain></SENT>
