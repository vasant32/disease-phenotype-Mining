<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated 35 MDS patients (24 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 10 RA with excess blasts and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>) with either horse antithymocyte globulin 15 mg/kg/day or rabbit antithymocyte globulin 3.75 mg/kg/day, each for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 63 years (range: 41-75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 to 34+ months of follow-up (mean: 15+), four patients experienced complete haematological responses (CR), six good responses (GR) and two minor responses </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 9+ (1-17+) months; five patients are in continuing response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 23 patients suffered side effects &gt; degrees II WHO (the degree of toxicity encountered according to the internationally accepted WHO toxicity grading); one patient died 2 weeks after rabbit ATG from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0348802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinocerebral mucormycosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parameters that correlated with response were duration of disease and RA subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our experience, immune-modulating therapy with either horse or rabbit ATG is feasible in patients with RA and short duration of disease </plain></SENT>
