<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and internal tandem duplication of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic PCR followed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By RT-PCR, expression of FLT3 was detected in 45/74 (61%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines and the frequency of expression of FLT3 was significantly higher in undifferentiated type (B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>; ALL) than in differentiated type cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) (P = 0.0076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the genomic PCR method, 194 fresh samples including 87 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath>, 60 ALLs, 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) and 15 juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCMLs</z:e>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tandem duplication was found in 12 (13.8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> and two (3.3%) ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses of the 14 samples with the duplication revealed that eight showed a simple tandem duplication and six a tandem duplication with insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of these tandem duplications occurred within exon 11, and two duplications occurred from exon 11 to intron 11 and exon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No tandem duplications of FLT3 gene were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of tandem duplication of FLT3 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e> was lower than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220615" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult AML</z:e> so far reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 12 AML patients with the duplication died within 47 months after diagnosis, whereas two ALL patients with the duplication have survived 44 and 72 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two ALL patients expressed both lymphoid and myeloid antigens and were considered to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_503'>biphenotypic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that tandem duplication is involved in ALL in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but not in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e> patients with the tandem duplication have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
