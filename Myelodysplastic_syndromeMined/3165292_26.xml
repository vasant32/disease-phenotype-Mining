<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical, hematologic, and phenotypic features of 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> with megakaryocytic involvement (AMKL) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the entire series was 11.6%, with a higher incidence among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation of a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) (24%) than among the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence in the "de novo" ANLL was 8% and 16% among secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> together with low WBC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>increased platelet counts</z:hpo> despite a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> are the most relevant features in these patients who otherwise displayed an apparently poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Megakaryoblasts were morphologically recognized more frequently in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> than in de novo ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two cases were considered pure AMKL, and in the remaining 26 patients, megakaryoblasts coexisted with other granulomonocytic and/or erythroid populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiglycoprotein IIIa (anti-GPIIIa) (C17) and anti-GPIIb/IIIa (CDw41-, J15-) antibodies are probably the best markers for AMKL, although the monoclonal antibody against GPIX (FMC25) was also positive in a majority of cases but in a lower percentage of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, megakaryoblasts were generally negative for granulocytic or monocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD15); the expression of HLA-DR antigens in these cells was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our present results indicate that megakaryoblastic involvement is more common than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is true not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> but also in de novo ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the diagnosis of these cases should be based on megakaryocytic markers, it is often possible to suspect a diagnosis according to certain clinical and hematologic features </plain></SENT>
