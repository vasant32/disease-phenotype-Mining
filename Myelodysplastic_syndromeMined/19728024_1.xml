<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their role in survival of patients and disease transformation is not extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe cytogenetic abnormalities in 172 patients with ET at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At presentation nine (5.2%) patients had cytogenetic abnormality and three (1.7%) additional patients acquired them during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients with cytogenetic changes at presentation did not differ when compared to the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The more common were abnormalities of chromosome 9 (n = 4), 20 (n = 2), 5 (n = 2), and complex abnormalities (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (23.8%) had additional cytogenetic tests performed for monitoring purposes during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (2.9%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MF) without developing new cytogenetic changes at transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.2%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes at presentation transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both acquired complex cytogenetic changes at the time of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no rationale for repeating cytogenetic tests in ET patients on follow up, unless blood cell count changes suggest possible transformation </plain></SENT>
