<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum hepcidin was found to be high in these patients, correlated with their iron and oxidative status, and further increased by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that the hepcidin level represents a balance between the stimulating effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and the inhibitory effects of erythropoietic activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
