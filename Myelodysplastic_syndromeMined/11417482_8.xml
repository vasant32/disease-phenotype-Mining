<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied platelet lifespan in 61 MDS cases with platelets &lt; 70,000/mm3 and marrow blasts &lt; 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of them (15%) had a major platelet lifespan reduction (&lt; 3.5 days), and were considered for splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of them were not splenectomized due to rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, patient refusal and older age plus liver predominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients (two females and four males, median age 50 years, range 32 to 65) were splenectomized 3 to 21 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before splenectomy, five of them had RA and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelets counts ranged from 5000 to 30,000/mm3 and did not durably respond to other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients has a relapse of platelet counts, concomitantly required platelet transfusion due to recurrent blending, whereas three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (two required erythrocyte transfusion) and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three months after surgery, platelet counts ranged from 55,000 to 160,000/mm3 (&gt; 100,000/mm3 in four cases), no patient required platelet or erythrocyte transfusion, but there was no effect on neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a relapse of platelet counts, concomitant with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in two of them, whereas the third relapsing case achieved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts with further <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts 12 months after splenectomy (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, probably related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> rather than splenectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients remained with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts 10 and 52 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> should be studied more often in 'low risk' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (i.e. with low bone marrow blast counts) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, as about 15% of them appear to have peripheral platelet destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Some of those patients may benefit from splenectomy </plain></SENT>
