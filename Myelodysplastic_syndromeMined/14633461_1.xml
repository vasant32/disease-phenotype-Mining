<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between methyltransferases and the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) and the leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was used to detect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level of DNMT1, 3A and 3B in bone marrow cells from 75 patients with AL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level of DNMTs between a low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (n = 21) and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, increased expression level of DNMT1, 3A and 3B was found in 47.6%, 47.6% and 42.9% of the patients in the low-risk group, respectively, if the upper limit of 80% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was considered as the critical level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 13), a more proportion of the cases with increased expression level of DNMTs were found, that was 53.8%, 76.9% and 92.3% respectively, and only expression level of DNMT3B was significantly higher than that in the low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the AL group (n = 41) expression level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three subtypes was coordinately higher than that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (P &lt; 0.01), companying with a more frequency of 92.7%, 97.6% and 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group, a significantly increased expression level of DNMT1 (P &lt; 0.01) with the same level of DNMT 3A and 3B was interestingly observed in the ALL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that up-regulated DNMTs contribute to the pathogenesis of AL and the leukemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and DNMT3B might be the most important enzyme among the three subtypes </plain></SENT>
