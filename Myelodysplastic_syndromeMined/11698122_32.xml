<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that an active autoimmune process in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) corresponds to the expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) displaying mature effector phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether the numbers of effector CTLs in blood of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes are elevated and correlate with the disease activity and responsiveness to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed samples from patients with AA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), polytransfused patients with nonimmune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls for the presence of effector T lymphocytes using four-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD57 and loss of CD28 on CD8+CD3+ CTL were used as markers for the terminal effector phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, intracellular staining for perforin and granzyme B was preformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of effector CTL did not differ between healthy individuals and hematologic controls and the two groups were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of CD8+CD28- and CD8+CD28-CD57+ cells were significantly higher in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward a gradual decrease in the effector CTLs from the high values observed in untreated new patients and patients who did not respond to immunosuppression, intermediate levels for partial responders and complete responders, to the lowest levels seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> did not correlate with the size of the effector cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to CD57+ CTLs, expression of perforin or granzyme B in the cytotoxic effector cells did not differ in AA patients from those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that phenotypically defined effector CTLs are increased in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the effector phenotype may be useful to isolate and characterize antigen-specific T cells in AA in order to delineate the possible inciting or driving agents in AA </plain></SENT>
