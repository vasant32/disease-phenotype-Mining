<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assayed the bone marrow erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) and granulocyte-machrophage CFUs (CFU-GM) to investigate the pathogenesis of feline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of CFU-E colonies was decreased in 4 of 7 cats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the number of CFU-GM colonies was also decreased in 4 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, small colonies of CFU-GM were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that refractory cytopenia of feline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be caused by abnormal maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow, as it is in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of feline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> might be similar to that of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
