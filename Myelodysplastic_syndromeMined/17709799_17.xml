<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) after treatment with ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis of the incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 746 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) treated with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen in registration and compassionate-use trials between 1996 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (2.5%) developed t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at a median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0 to 9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were diagnosed at a median of 5.6 years (range, 1.4 to 13.9) after the diagnosis of NHL and 1.9 years (range, 0.4 to 6.3) after radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annualized rates were 0.3% per year after the diagnosis of NHL and 0.7% per year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had multiple cytogenetic aberrations, commonly on chromosomes 5 and 7, suggesting an association with previous exposure to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Analysis of data from patients in registration and compassionate-use trials suggests that the annualized incidences of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are consistent with that expected in patients with NHL who have had extensive previous chemotherapy treatment and do not appear to be increased after treatment with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic testing before treatment with radioimmunotherapy may identify existing chromosomal abnormalities in previously treated patients, particularly those who have been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs and would be at higher risk for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
