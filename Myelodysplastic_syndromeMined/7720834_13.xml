<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately there is not much material published concerning the incidence of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present epidemiologic data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> based on case registration of patients in a well-defined population and as a comparison similar data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between the years 1978-1992 we registered 120 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 146 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases was 74.1 years for men and 78.2 years for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among haematologists there is a suspicion that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is rising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study does not support this opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have divided the study period into 5-year periods and the crude incidence has been 3.2, 4.1 and 3.5/100,000/year for each period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the age group over 70 years <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was more frequent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and in the last 5-year period the incidence was 15.0/100,000/year for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to 10.2/100,000/year for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is quite common among elderly people and there is no evidence for a rising incidence during the last 15 years </plain></SENT>
