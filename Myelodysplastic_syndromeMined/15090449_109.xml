<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared outcomes after a truly nonablative regimen (120 mg/m2 fludarabine, 4 g/m2 cytarabine, and 36 mg/m2 idarubicin [FAI]) and a more myelosuppressive, reduced-intensity regimen (100 to 150 mg/m2 fludarabine and 140 or 180 mg/m2 melphalan [FM]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of 94 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 26) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 68) treated with FM (n = 62) and FAI (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FAI group had a higher proportion of patients in complete remission (CR) at transplantation (44% versus 16%, P =.006), patients in first CR (28% versus 3%, P =.008), and HLA-matched sibling donors (81% versus 40%, P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up is 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FM was significantly associated with a higher degree of donor cell engraftment, higher cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM; P =.036), and lower cumulative incidence of relapse-related mortality (P =.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse rate after FAI and FM was 61% and 30%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 3-year survival rate was 30% after FAI and 35% following FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis of patient- and treatment-related prognostic factors, progression-free survival was improved after FM, for patients in CR at transplantation, and for those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was improved for patients in CR at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FM provided better disease control though at a cost of increased TRM and morbidity </plain></SENT>
