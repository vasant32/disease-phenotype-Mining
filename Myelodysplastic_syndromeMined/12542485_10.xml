<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one MORF-CBP fusion transcript, exon 15 of the MORF gene was fused in frame with exon 5 of the CBP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a reciprocal CBP-MORF transcript, exon 4 of the CBP gene was fused in frame with exon 16 of the MORF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported case of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with t(10;16), and provides molecular evidence that the novel MORF-CBP and/or CBP-MORF fusion protein(s) might play an important role in the development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
