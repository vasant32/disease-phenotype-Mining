<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A referral-based bone marrow transplant center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 59 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or closely related disorders and either life-threatening cytopenia or a progressive increase in marrow blast percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from either an HLA-identical (n = 45) or HLA-partially matched (n = 14) donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The product-limit estimate for disease-free survival 3 years after transplant is 45% (95% CI, 32% to 59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The commonest causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transplant were disease recurrence, interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, accounting for eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, younger patients, those with shorter disease duration, and those whose disease was characterized by an abnormal cytogenetic karyotype had better survival and disease-free survival than the group as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, younger age and abnormal karyotype were independent predictors of improved disease-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who received transplants when they had fewer blasts in their bone marrow had a decreased chance for disease recurrence when compared with patients with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplantation offers a potential cure for many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Best results can be expected in younger patients who receive transplants relatively early in their disease course </plain></SENT>
