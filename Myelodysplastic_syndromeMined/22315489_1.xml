<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The current World Health Organization classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is based morphological evaluation of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, the reproducibility of the recognition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is usually poor especially in cases that lack specific markers such as ring sideroblasts and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to develop and validate a flow cytometric score for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four reproducible parameters were analyzed: CD34(+) myeloblast-related and B-progenitor-related cluster size (defined by CD45 expression and side scatter characteristics CD34(+) marrow cells), myeloblast CD45 expression and granulocyte side scatter value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study comprised a "learning cohort" (n=538) to define the score and a "validation cohort" (n=259) to confirm its diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With respect to non-clonal cytopenias, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> had increased myeloblast-related cluster size, decreased B-progenitor-related cluster size, aberrant CD45 expression and reduced granulocyte side scatter (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To define the flow cytometric score, these four parameters were combined in a regression model and the weight for each variable was estimated based on coefficients from that model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the learning cohort a correct diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was formulated in 198/281 cases (sensitivity 70%), while 18 false-positive results were noted among 257 controls (specificity 93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of patients without specific markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ring sideroblasts and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities) were correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high value of the flow cytometric score was associated with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P=0.001), transfusion dependency (P=0.02), and poor-risk cytogenetics (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity in the validation cohort (69% and 92%, respectively) were comparable to those in the learning cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The likelihood ratio of the flow cytometric score was 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A flow cytometric score may help to establish the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, especially when <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics are indeterminate </plain></SENT>
