<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As no study in cost of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exists in Germany, the objective of this study was to assess and analyze costs of transfusion-dependent low/intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Germany from a payers' perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From seven centers, 116 low/intermediate-1-risk transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with and without isolated 5q-deletion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Claims data and patient records of the previous 5Â years were used to collect health care utilization data retrospectively </plain></SENT>
