<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e>, selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> increase the expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">sodium-iodide</z:chebi> symporter and uptake of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their effects in humans are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the second <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-124 PET study indicated that a dose of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with mutations of NRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selumetinib increased the uptake of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with NRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients treated with radioiodine, 5 had confirmed partial responses and 3 had stable disease; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had decreases in serum thyroglobulin levels (mean reduction, 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No toxic effects of grade 3 or higher attributable by the investigators to selumetinib were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient received a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> more than 51 weeks after radioiodine treatment, with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-mutant disease </plain></SENT>
