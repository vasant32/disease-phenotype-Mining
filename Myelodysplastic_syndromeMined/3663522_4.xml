<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patterns of erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis were studied in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and in one with smouldering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> by correlating CFU-C, BFU-E and CFU-E cloning efficiency with erythroid and myeloid maturation indices derived from quantitative <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-autoradiography and with ferrokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maturation index of a cell lineage was defined as the ratio of cell production rate increase from the first to the last proliferative compartment over the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The myeloid maturation index was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but CFU-C progenitor frequency was increased by a factor of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid maturation index was also reduced in most cases, and BFU-E progenitor frequency was reduced by a factor of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CFU-E cloning efficiency corrected for the erythroid maturation index was 2.5-10-fold lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the erythroid maturation index with ferrokinetics revealed a constant ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> with a maturation disturbance in the proliferative pool twice that in the non-proliferative pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate basic qualitative and quantitative abnormalities and a difference in the patterns of production of erythroid and myeloid cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>: Myeloid progenitors are increased in number but their maturation is grossly abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the apparent reduction in erythroid progenitors and the reduced erythroid maturation index are attributable to both premature cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the more mature erythroblasts and an increased proerythroblast proliferation, i.e. extra divisions in the proerythroblast compartment at the expense of maturation </plain></SENT>
