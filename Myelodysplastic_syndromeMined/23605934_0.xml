<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to externally validate this new risk model using a large single-institution cohort, determine its prognostic power in patients receiving active treatment, and explore its utility in guiding therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected retrospectively from our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) database and verified by chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 1088 patients with data available, 152 (14%), 353 (32%), 237 (22%), 190 (18%), and 156 (14%) patients were classified as very low, low, intermediate, high, and very high risk, respectively, with median overall survival (OS) of 90 (95%CI 71-109), 54 (95%CI 50-59), 34 (95%CI 26-43), 21 (95%CI 17-25), and 13 months (95%CI 11-15), respectively (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the IPSS-R further refined prognostic discrimination in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IPSS risk categories, particularly in the intermediate-1 and -2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among high and very-high IPSS-R patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, OS was significantly improved versus patients not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, with corresponding median OS of 25 versus 18 months (P=0.023) and 15 versus 9 months (P=0.005), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients with IPSS-R high and very-high risk disease who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had significantly improved OS versus non-transplant approaches (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High and very-high IPSS-R patients derived a survival advantage from disease-modifying therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data validate the prognostic value of the proposed IPSS-R and show that its refined IPSS prognostic discrimination can be applied to actively treated patients </plain></SENT>
