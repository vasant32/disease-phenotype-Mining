<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predictive models for response to growth factors (GF) have been developed based on red blood cell transfusion needs and erythropoietin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the optimal initial therapy (GF vs nongrowth factor [NGF] therapies, including differentiation and immunomodulatory agents) based on response rates to NGF and GF and survival, has not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov decision analysis was performed on 799 low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with either GF or NGF to determine the appropriate initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment strategies analyzed included initial GF or NGF therapies, assuming 3 different states: Patients were either in the good GF predictive group (low transfusion needs and low erythropoietin levels), intermediate, or the poor GF predictive group (high transfusion needs and high erythropoietin levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the good GF predictive group, initial therapy with GF improved survival compared with NGF therapies at 3.38 years vs 2.57 years for a typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The advantage of GF to NGF was lost when NGF therapies produced a response in &gt;or=46% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intermediate or poor GF predictive groups, NGF maximized survival, provided response rates for NGF were &gt;14% and 4%, respectively, for each predictive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quality of life adjustment did not alter the preferred strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modeling estimates suggest that patients who fall into a good GF predictive group should almost always receive GF initially, whereas those in intermediate and poor predictive groups should almost always be treated with NGF </plain></SENT>
