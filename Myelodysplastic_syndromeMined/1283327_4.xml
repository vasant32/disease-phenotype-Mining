<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a first step in characterizing the t(3;5) breakpoints, we asked whether the translocation involves the CSFIR/PDGFRB locus at 5q33-q35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of a region extending 580 kb 5' to the PDGFRB gene and 120 kb 3' to the CSFIR gene did not reveal aberrant restriction fragments in leukemic cell DNA, confirming that the breakpoint does not occur in the vicinity of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To sublocalize the breakpoint, we performed Southern blot hybridizations using DNA from human x hamster somatic cell hybrids containing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 3, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 5, the derivative 3, or the derivative 5 human chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a series of polymorphic DNA probes from the long arm of chromosome 5, which have been linked by genetic recombination, we bracketed the breakpoint to within a region that spans approximately 13 centimorgans (sex average) and is flanked by the q34-qter markers cKK5.19 and L1200 (D5S62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis places the chromosome 5 breakpoint of the t(3;5) considerably telomeric to the CSFIR/PDGFRB locus, confirming our studies with pulsed-field electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future efforts to identify the genes affected by the t(3;5) should focus on the 5q segment described in this study </plain></SENT>
