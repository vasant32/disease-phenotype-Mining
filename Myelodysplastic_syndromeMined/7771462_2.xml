<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between peripheral blood and bone marrow findings, both for G-score figures (r = 0.92, P &lt; 0.01) and ppp (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower G-score figures were found among patients with an increased percentage of bone marrow blasts (P &lt; 0.05), while high ppp correlated with the presence of ring sideroblasts, the degree of bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and findings of complex chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high degree of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had significantly lower G-score (P &lt; 0.01) and significantly higher ppp (P &lt; 0.05) figures, than those with less pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, extreme hypogranulation (G-score &lt; 150) or very high ppp (&gt; or = 20%) was generally a sign of bi- and tri-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results thus show that quantitative estimation of peripheral blood polymorph <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by G-score figures and ppp seems to reflect the total degree of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may serve as a complement to bone marrow evaluation when the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is difficult </plain></SENT>
