<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that copy number changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone that occur at polymorphic loci are frequently somatic alterations rather than constitutional variants, and the extent of copy number changes at polymorphic loci is increased in CD34(+) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a potential pathophysiological role for copy number alterations at polymorphic loci in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and highlights the need for somatic control tissues for each patient studied in high-resolution genome-wide investigations </plain></SENT>
