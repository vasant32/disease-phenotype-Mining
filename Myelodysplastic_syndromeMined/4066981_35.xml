<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prognostic variables for a transition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> were: cellular atypias of the three haemopoietic lineages, as observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and especially "micromegakaryocytes"; high numbers or irregular distribution of megakaryocytes, or both; and (slight) marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this study aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> can thus be subdivided morphologically into two disease entities--namely, hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with a 23-82% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> developing within three years, depending on how many variables associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> are present, and non-dysplastic myelohypoplasia </plain></SENT>
