<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VEGF levels normalized for bone marrow cellularity (VEGF index [VEGFi]) were higher in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) "very high risk" than in the "very low risk" group (P = .009) and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a poor karyotype than in the other cytogenetic risk groups (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High VEGFi (&gt;75(th) percentile) predicted transfusion dependence (adjusted odds ratio, 10.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-106), and were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of VEGFi in the International Prognostic Scoring System and WPSS maintained its significant prognostic role in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free and overall survival; it also seemed to improve the discrimination of the different prognostic classes, especially WPSS low-risk classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the clinical relevance of VEGFi expression in the bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
