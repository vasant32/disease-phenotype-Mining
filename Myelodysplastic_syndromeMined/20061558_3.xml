<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that marrow stroma-derived signals convey sensitivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in otherwise-resistant KG1a myeloid cells and CD34(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used a PhosphoScan proteomic liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to identify signals relevant for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor DJ-1/PARK-7 (DJ-1) was highly phosphorylated in KG1a cells cultured without stroma but dephosphorylated after stroma coculture, whereas expression of p53 increased significantly, suggesting a stroma contact-dependent effect of DJ-1 on p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CD34(+) marrow cells from advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, expression of DJ-1 was up-regulated, whereas p53 levels were low, resulting in significantly greater DJ-1/p53 ratios than in patients with low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DJ-1 levels were correlated with increasing International Prognostic Scoring System scores (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing DJ-1/p53 ratios were associated with an increased risk of mortality, although the correlation did not reach statistical significance (P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that DJ-1/p53 interactions contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance in clonal myeloid cells and may serve as a prognostic marker in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
