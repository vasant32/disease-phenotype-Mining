<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of protein kinase R (PKR) in the generation of the inhibitory effects of these myelosuppressive cytokines on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that PKR is rapidly phosphorylated/activated in response to engagement of IFNγ or TNFα receptors in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such engagement of PKR is important for the suppressive effects of these cytokines on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological targeting of PKR using a specific inhibitor or siRNA-mediated PKR knockdown results in partial reversal of the suppressive effects of IFNγ and TNFα on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CD34+-derived myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-monocytic) and erythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid) progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, inhibition of PKR activity or expression increases hematopoietic colony formation from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors, suggesting that drugs that target PKR may provide a novel approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and marrow failure syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data establish that beyond its key role in the induction of IFN-antiviral responses, PKR plays important roles in signaling for IFNγ and other myelosuppressive cytokine receptors as a common mediator of signals for hematopoietic suppression </plain></SENT>
