<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification has designated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with inv(3) or t(3;3) and associated RPN1/EVI1 fusion, as a distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subgroup associated with an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have created a dual color, double fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) assay to detect fusion of the RPN1 and EVI1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A blinded investigation was performed using 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples and 51 bone marrow samples from 17 patients with inv(3)(q21q26.2), 11 patients with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), and one patient with ins(3;3)(q26.2;q21q26.2) previously defined by chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unblinded results indicated abnormal RPN1/EVI1 fusion results in 30 (97%) of 31 samples from the inv(3)(q21q26.2) group including seven bone marrow samples for which chromosome analysis was unsuccessful or failed to detect an inv(3)(q21q26.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal FISH results were detected in 14 (88%) of 16 samples with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) and in the sole sample with an ins(3;3)(q26.2;q21q26.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 negative controls were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and were used to establish a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cutoff of 0.6% for the typical abnormal D-FISH signal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, this D-FISH assay was more accurate than chromosome analysis and based on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cutoff of 0.6%, this assay can be used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> detection and disease monitoring in patients with RPN1/EVI1 fusion </plain></SENT>
