<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1981 and 1996 we treated 99 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, with IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>41 (41%) achieved CR, 16 (16%) achieved partial remission (PR), 26 (26%) had failure, and 16 (16%) died in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients who achieved CR were autografted, three were allografted and the remaining cases received moderate consolidation chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After IC, the 16 PR patients fulfilled the criteria for RA in 15 cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PR duration was 17 months, and three PR were &gt; 3 years (39, 50+, 82+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial survival of patients who achieved PR and CR was 18 months and 20 months from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IC, respectively (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 71 patients treated before 1993, with sufficient follow-up, 10 (14%) had survived &gt; 4 years (long-term survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of them were alive in first CR after 49+ to 110+ months and probably cured, two were alive in PR after 50+ and 82+ months and four had died after 49-78 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term survivors were characterized by a significantly higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> at diagnosis, and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or favourable cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> at diagnosis included before 1993, 8/23 (35%) cases who had no unfavourable karyotype had survived &gt; 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who achieve PR with IC, and not only those who achieve CR, can benefit from this type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of long-term survivors remains low, however, and is almost restricted to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> at diagnosis and no unfavourable karyotype </plain></SENT>
