<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We looked for bcl-2 protein expression by immunocytochemistry on bone marrow slides from 51 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), of whom 25 received some form of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six of them had at least 20% bcl-2 positive blasts and the median percentage of positive blasts was 80%, whereas myeloid cells beyond blasts were always negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between bcl-2 expression and the FAB type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, CD34 expression and P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between weak bcl-2 expression and the presence of a p53 mutation detected by SSCP analysis and direct sequencing was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to chemotherapy (intensive chemotherapy or low-dose Ara-C) and survival were not significantly influenced by the intensity of bcl-2 expression in blasts, although there was a trend for better response to chemotherapy and longer survival in patients with strong bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This trend was no longer found, however, if patients with a p53 mutation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that blasts from a majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases have bcl-2 expression and that strong bcl-2 expression is not associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between weak bcl-2 expression and p53 mutation suggests a possible downregulation of bcl-2 gene expression by mutated p53, the mechanism of which remains to be established </plain></SENT>
