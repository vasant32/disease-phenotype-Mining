<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This chromosome abnormality is known to occur predominantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0457334" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB type M5a</z:e> and less often in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4; in this series it was also found to occur, uncommonly, in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> FAB types, in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (nine cases), in relatively young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (five cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>acute biphenotypic leukemia</z:hpo> (two cases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> age groups were represented but 50% of the patients were aged less than 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(9;11) was the sole abnormality in 57 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was the most common additional abnormality (23 cases, including seven with further abnormalities), and 28 cases had other additional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the t(9;11)+ve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the white cell count (WBC) and age group were significant predictors of event-free survival; central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement or karyotype class (sole, with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, or with other), also contributed to prognosis although our data could not show these to be independent factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best outcome was for patients aged 1-9 years, with low WBC, and with absence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease or presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients aged less than 15 years, the event-free survival for ALL patients was not significantly worse than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
