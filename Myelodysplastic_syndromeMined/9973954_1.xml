<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With an incidence estimated to be approximately 1 per 100,000 persons per year, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mainly affects the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> share many features with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; in fact, a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> eventually develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To illustrate a multimodal approach in the diagnosis of patients with hematopoietic disorders, we describe a 66-year-old patient with a question of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and two translocations involving chromosome 10:t(5;10) and t(7;10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These structural rearrangements effectively gave rise to <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for part of the long arm of chromosome 5 and for the long arm of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings of del(5q) and del(7) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of chromosome morphometry, which was conducted to compare the lengths of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant chromosome segments, are consistent with the hypothesized chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The investigational technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using both painting and alpha-satellite probes, was used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics to further delineate the nature of the chromosome abnormalities observed in the GTG-banded studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory studies utilizing the new technique of spectral karyotyping (SKY) were also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the multimodal approach of hematopathology, GTG-banding, chromosome morphometry, FISH, and SKY can be very useful for delineating complex cytogenetic cases </plain></SENT>
