<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan over 11 years from January 1997 to August 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a descriptive case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the impact of disease biology and various treatment protocols on the outcome in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 55 evaluable patients (&gt;60 years of age) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> including 34 (61.8%) males and 21 (38.2%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 67 years (range 60-86 years) at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 15 (27.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk cytogenetics were observed in 3 (5.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty patients received palliative treatment while only 15 received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the last group with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=10), there were 2 remitters, one showed resistant disease while 8 had induction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mean survival was 75.1 days (95% confidence interval: 46.7-103.5 days) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no survival advantage in patients treated with chemotherapy versus those conservatively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found high mortality among aged patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in our setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving chemotherapy were extremely intolerant to toxic drugs and succumbed earlier than patients receiving palliative care only </plain></SENT>
