<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between July 1993 and October 2001, 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> relapsing after allogeneic BMT received DLI as salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of BMT, one patient had RA, nine had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, of whom three were in CR after induction-type chemotherapy, two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 49 months, six patients were alive, of whom two were in CR after DLI alone and remained disease-free, two were in CR after a second BMT and two had active disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although DLI alone seems to be effective in a small number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, other treatment strategies, including prior debulking chemotherapy, deserve investigation </plain></SENT>
