<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To optimize treatment for younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> by comparing induction options and the number of consolidation courses and whether consolidation should include transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 1,658 patients younger than age 60 years to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and subsequently 1,193 patients to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/thioguanine (DAT) where the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> dose was standard (S-DAT) versus double the standard dose (H-DAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in this randomization were randomly assigned to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In consolidation, 992 patients were randomly assigned between a total of four courses versus five courses, and 324 patients who were not good risk were randomly assigned to transplantation or chemotherapy as the final course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 74% of patients and CR without recovery was achieved in an additional 11%; overall survival (OS) at 8 years was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in CR, relapse-free survival, relapse, or OS were seen between any of the induction randomizations except for a reduction in relapse risk (RR) on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> arm, which was offset by increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of a fifth course did not improve OS and may be detrimental in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although transplantation reduced RR, it did not improve OS for the intermediate-risk group but was probably of benefit in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Several chemotherapy schedules achieved similar remission rates and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four courses of chemotherapy are adequate, but the addition of transplantation as a final course does not improve OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New agents are required to enhance conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
