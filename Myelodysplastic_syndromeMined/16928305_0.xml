<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of T cells, B cells, NK cells in peripheral blood from 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and their surface activation markers of CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD69, HLA-DR were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were in the low risk group (RA + <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) while eight patients were in the high risk group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result showed that the amounts of T cells (CD3+ cells) in peripheral blood from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were lower than those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amounts of naive CD4+ cells (CD4+ CD45RA+ cells) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were lower than those in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression rates of early activation marker (CD69) and late activation marker (HLA-DR) on CD3+ cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities of the immunologically competent cells were mainly observed in the low risk group (RA + <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), and were characterized by the high expression rates of CD69+ and HLA-DR+ on CD3+ cells, the decrease of B cell amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount abnormalities of T cell subsets were mainly observed in high risk group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>), and were characterized by the decrease of CD3+ cells and CD3+ CD4+ CD8- cells (Th cells) amounts without high expression of the CD69 and HLA-DR, the decrease of NK cells amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that there are the abnormalities of T cell subsets and function in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may change with disease progression, so the measurement of amount and activated status of T cell subsets in peripheral blood from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients can have predictive role for diagnosis of disease progression and guide of therapy </plain></SENT>
