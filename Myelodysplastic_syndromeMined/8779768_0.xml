<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the endonuclease activity capable of inducing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mg(2+)-dependent nuclease activity was high in hematopoietic progenitor cells and the activity decreased with myeloid or erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/Mg(2+)-dependent nuclease activity varied widely in the samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the possibility was indicated that the activity of Glycophorin A+ cells was related to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated DNA strand breaks in bone marrow samples from 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 10 with other diseases by an in situ end labeling (ISEL) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reactivity in ISEL tended to increase parallel to disease progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high ISEL-positivity was also observed in some samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though ISEL is a useful technique for quantification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, our results suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells with ISEL positive staining are not necessarily in the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
