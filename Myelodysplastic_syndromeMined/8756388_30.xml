<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of, and improve outcome by, incorporating ifosfamide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (IE) into the therapy of newly diagnosed patients with Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> family of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005967" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of bone</z:e> and soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four newly diagnosed patients received 7 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (VAdriaC) and 11 cycles of IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy after the fifth chemotherapy cycle was the primary approach to local control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Actuarial 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates were 42% and 45%, respectively, with a median duration of potential follow-up of 6.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EFS was significantly better for patients with localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than for those with metastatic lesions (64% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>13%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial local progression-free survival at 5 years was 74%, and did not correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> size or site, histologic subtype, or the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> developed after 49% of cycles, and clinical or sub-clinical cardiac dysfunction was common (7% and 40% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were four toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one case of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial toxicity, the integration of IE into the front-line, VAdriaC-based therapy of patients with Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> family of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is feasible and appeared to significantly improve the outcome for patients with high risk localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but had no impact on the poor prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local control can be achieved in the vast majority of patients using radiotherapy exclusively, even among patients with bulky, central axis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the late effects of this intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
