<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M(2), n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, n = 4), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, n = 2) were intolerant of conventional myeloablative therapy because of age (older than 50 years) or having severe concurrent diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 49 years (range 42-64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven were males and five females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the 12 patients were HLA one antigen-mismatched and the rest HLA identical with their donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low dosage conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 3 days), Ara-C (2 g.m(-2).d(-1) for 1 or 2 times), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (1.0 g.m(-2).d(-1) for 2 days) and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG 2.5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 4 days, -5 - -2 day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were harvested (1 patient using PBSC alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, short-term MTX and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) for prophylaxis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA short tandem repeat (STR) sequence analysis, cytogenetics and molecular-biologic technique were used to analyze chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were well tolerated the regimen, with no severe regimen related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 12 patients, absolute neutrophil count &gt; or = 0.5 x10(9)/L was achieved in 11 to 17 (median 15) days and platelet count &gt; 20 x 10(9)/L in 10 to 23 (median 15) days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete chimerism was achieved in 11 patients and 1 patient was in mixed chimerism at one month after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 14.5 (4.0-24.0) months, 7 of the 12 patients (58.0%) were alive and 5 (42.0%) of the 7 were disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of OS and DFS at 12 months were 75.0% and 48.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients (41.6%) had aGVHD and four had local <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD with a cumulative probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD of 41.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This reduced intensity conditioning regimen is well tolerated and safe for HSCT in the older patients or patients with severe concurrent medical conditions and can achieve full chimerism and long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
