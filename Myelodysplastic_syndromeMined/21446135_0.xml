<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the CD34 expression in bone marrow biopsies and its prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and to analyze it in the context of different clinical, laboratory and prognostic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 53 MDS patients and 20 controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD34 expression was determined by CD34 monoclonal antibody and labelled streptovidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> peroxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positivity was determined by counting the 500 cells and it was expressed as percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 53 MDS patients there were 37 males and 16 females with average age of 62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average CD34 expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group was 1.37%, the range being 0-8.8%, and in the control group 0.78%, the range being 0-1.60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in the CD34 expression comparing RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> group and high risk and low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival in the patients with the CD34 expression with less than 2% was 22 months, while it was 6 months in the patients with the CD34 expression over 2% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis the CD34 expression together with the karyotype and transfusion dependence had a statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CD34 expression in bone marrow biopsies is higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients comparing with the controls as well as in high risk comparing with low risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cutoff 2% seems to have a prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
