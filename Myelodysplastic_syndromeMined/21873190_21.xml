<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatic loss-of-function mutations of TET2 are frequently observed in patients with diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By analyzing mice with targeted disruption of the Tet2 catalytic domain, we show here that Tet2 is a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tet2 deficiency led to decreased genomic levels of 5hmC and augmented the size of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pool in a cell-autonomous manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In competitive transplantation assays, Tet2-deficient <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> were capable of multilineage reconstitution and possessed a competitive advantage over <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, resulting in enhanced hematopoiesis into both lymphoid and myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, Tet2 deficiency delayed <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> differentiation and skewed development toward the monocyte/macrophage lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that Tet2 has a critical role in regulating the expansion and function of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, presumably by controlling 5hmC levels at genes important for the self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
