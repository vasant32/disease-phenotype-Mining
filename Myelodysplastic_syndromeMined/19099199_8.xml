<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A case series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> treated with alkylator-based chemotherapy who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (tMDS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alkylator-based chemotherapy is recognized to be leukemogenic; however, it is infrequently described as a delayed consequence of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Seven patients (4 men; 3 women) ages 34-69 years (median 44), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> (3 Grade 2; 4 Grade 3) were treated with surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one with involved-field radiotherapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with alkylator-based chemotherapy (temozolomide; 6 patients, nitrosoureas; 5 patients, both agents; 5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to alkylator-based chemotherapy ranged from 8 to 30 months (median 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of tMDS was determined by bone marrow biopsy in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients showed chromosomal abnormalities consistent with chemotherapy induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as well (in two determined by bone marrow and one at autopsy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interval from last chemotherapy exposure to diagnosis of tMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> ranged from 3 to 31 months (median 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated with bone marrow transplantation and 5 received supportive care only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients have died, 2 as a consequence of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp>, 1 as a complication of transplantation, and 2 due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, induction of tMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following extended use of alkylator-based chemotherapy may become more relevant with the evolving practice to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> for protracted periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future work to determine at risk patients would be important </plain></SENT>
