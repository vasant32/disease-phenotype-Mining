<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> in his left lower limb in May </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood cell count showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and immature myeloid cells were seen in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> showed the proliferation of myeloblasts (11.2%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities were detected including the long arm deletion of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001959'>polydipsia</z:hpo> after admission and was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000863'>central diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was treated with DDAVP and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In November, he underwent unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after conditioning with total body irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000863'>Central diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> has been reported as a rare complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000873'>diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> after bone marrow transplantation suggests that the infiltration of leukemic cells into the pituitary gland caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000873'>diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> in this case </plain></SENT>
