<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of chromosome banding techniques has provided a valuable diagnostic tool in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The application of these methods, however, is often restricted by a low yield of mitotic cells and the patient's unwillingness to comply with repeated bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to promote mitotic activity of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and peripheral blood, we employed a new method based on culturing the cells in the presence of a conditioned medium derived from a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> cell line (5637) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to colony stimulating factor, this conditioned medium contains a factor that is capable of stimulating leukemic myeloblast proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 58 patients with a variety of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were cultured for 24 to 120 hours in the presence or absence of conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These bone marrow cells showed a pronounced increase in the mitotic index (5- to 50-fold) as compared to unstimulated cultures, and a greater than 100-fold increase as compared to fresh, uncultured bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyzable metaphases could be obtained even in marrow samples in which direct or 24-hour G-banding techniques had failed to reveal metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect observed on peripheral blood cells was even more dramatic because prior to culture no mitotic cells were detected, whereas up to 2% mitotic cells were found in conditioned medium-stimulated peripheral leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis of 36 out of the 58 leukemic patients has shown that the chromosome changes discovered in conditioned medium stimulated cells were identical to those found in unstimulated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New chromosome aberrations, attributable to the stimulation of growth by conditioned medium, were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The quality of the metaphases analyzed following conditioned medium stimulation was considerably better than that of unstimulated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frozen cells, when cultured with conditioned medium, were also suitable for cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of this conditioned medium permits adequate cytogenetic analysis even in cases where such analysis was previously impossible </plain></SENT>
