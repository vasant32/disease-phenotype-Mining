<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were licensed in 1993, more than 70 randomized controlled trials and more than 20 meta-analyses and systematic reviews on their effectiveness were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a systematic review on the meta-analyses of trials evaluating ESAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published meta-analyses of at least five randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of ESAs versus control in patients with any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included a total of 23 systematic reviews and meta-analyses (16 literature based and 7 based on individual patient data (IPD)) that assessed several outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 meta-analyses reporting on transfusion risks demonstrated that ESAs significantly reduce the risk of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven meta-analyses (nine based on published data and two on IPD) evaluated thrombovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of thrombovascular events was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two meta-analyses (relative risks (RRs) ranging from 1.57 to 1.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, potential reporting and publication bias as well as detection bias call for a cautious interpretation of these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival and mortality were evaluated in 18 meta-analyses, with the observed effect changing over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While meta-analyses on studies conducted before 2002 showed beneficial effects of ESAs on survival, contrary results, i.e. worsened survival, was seen in meta-analyses including more recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results from several meta-analyses show that ESAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients reduce the risk for red blood cell transfusions and increase the risk for thrombovascular events and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of ESAs on mortality risk in patients receiving chemotherapy remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, the benefits and risks of ESAs should be carefully considered and decisions should be made based on each patient's situation and preferences </plain></SENT>
