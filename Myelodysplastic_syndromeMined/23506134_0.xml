<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to investigate RPS14 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without 5q deletion and the role of lower expressed RPS14 plays in pathogenesis and the prognosis and lenalidomide-response predicting of non-5q-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of RPS14 transcription was detected in 156 MDS patients without 5q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of bone marrow (BM) nucleated erythrocytes was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patient prognosis with lower or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RPS14 expression was analyzed, and the role of RPS14 expression in lenalidomide-response prediction was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reduced RPS14 expression occurred in 83 of 156 (53.2%) non-5q-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with RPS14 lower expression presented higher platelet counts in the peripheral blood compared with RPS14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lower RPS14 expression status was inversely correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> ratio in nucleated erythrocytes from BM (r = -0.54, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower RPS14 expression have a higher 2-yr survival probability than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RPS14 cases in the international prognosis scoring system (IPSS) lower risk group (90.8% vs. 71.7%; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed RPS14 expression status was an independent predictor for survival in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were treated with lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of seven patients achieved an erythroid response in the lower RPS14 expression group (5/7, 71.4%), compared with zero responses in the five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RPS14 patients (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower RPS14 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without 5q deletion is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of nucleated erythrocytes in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, lower RPS14 predicts prolonged survival and possible response to lenalidomide in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
