<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 95 children with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> treated with 131I-MIBG at UCSF, 3 have been identified with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case records and bone marrow results were reviewed, along with a review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, at 7, 11, and 12 months following 131I-MIBG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities included -7q/-5, -7/+2q37, -11 and +12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three additional cases were found in literature review of 509 reported patients treated with 131I-MIBG for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with 131I-MIBG may contribute to the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in patients who have received intensive chemotherapy, thought the risk of this complication is far lower than the risk of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further monitoring for this complication is indicated </plain></SENT>
