<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in neutrophils associated with transition to a morphological picture identical to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control cultures occurred in 15 of 25 studies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in contrast to one of six studies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An abnormal neoplastic karyotype was employed as a marker for monitoring the course of the neoplastic cell population in 11 studies in which there was progression towards a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase in differentiation was shown by this means to represent increased maturation of cells of the neoplastic process in one study on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorder</z:mpath>, demonstrating domination of proliferative activity in culture by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> examined </plain></SENT>
