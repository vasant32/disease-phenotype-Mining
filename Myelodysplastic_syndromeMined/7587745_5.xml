<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we assess a flow cytometric gating method and its correlation with a concurrent manual bone marrow differential in abnormal marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells, leukemic blasts fall into discrete areas when a cytogram of CD 45 expression and Right Angle Light Scatter is plotted in Log scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 50 specimens with a suspected diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gates were set on the eight discrete clusters typically found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We employed these gates to determine the differential of the abnormal bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show a high correlation between the flow differential and the manual differential with the following r values: blasts 0.875; promyelocytes 0.914; myeloid precursors 0.879; neutrophils 0.776; lymphocytes 0.707; monocytes 0.913; and erythroid precursors 0.873 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition some leukemic infiltrates appear to produce a characteristic pattern with the CD 45 vs. RALS cytogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, there is a total of 6 cases (3 false positives and 3 false negatives) where the flow differential does not render the same diagnosis as the manual differential, and 4 cases in which there is evidence of marked peripheral contamination leading to disagreement between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method provides a relatively easy and powerful tool which can be applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow specimens that undergo flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can greatly enhance the identification and lineage assessment of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation with a manual differential is high, and this gating method may provide an inexpensive and easy means of obtaining an automated bone marrow differential </plain></SENT>
