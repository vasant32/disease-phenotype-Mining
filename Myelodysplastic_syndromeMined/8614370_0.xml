<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was staged as IIIA, nodular sclerosing type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, and was given eight alternative cycles of MOPP-ABVD followed by "mantle" field radiotherapy to a total dose of 3.3 Gy plus 0.4 Gy to the upper mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 8 months following the completion of therapy, a period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and progressive severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo>, considered as a result of initial treatment, occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> diagnosis while the patient was continuously neutropenic and heavily immunocompromised, a peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024307" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LYG|AIL">angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion</z:e> type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIL</z:e>) Grade III, appeared in both lungs within and beyond the radiation field, with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
