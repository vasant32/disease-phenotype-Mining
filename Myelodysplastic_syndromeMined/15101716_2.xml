<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the pathobiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CD95 and CD95L in CD34+ cells of patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by flow cytometry, and examined the relation between this expression and FAB and WHO types, total number of CD34+ bone marrow (BM) cells and the degree of peripheral cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> showed CD34+ cells in numbers comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, but had a higher percentage of CD95/CD34 and CD95L/CD34 positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was found between these cells and the total CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was also observed when only patients with RA were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, however, CD95/CD95L expression correlated with CD34+ cells but not with the percentage of BM blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After classification by the WHO proposal, the patients with refractory cytopenias with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed features intermediary between RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was seen between the expression of CD95/CD95L and the peripheral blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are in keeping with the hypothesis that, as the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> precursors increases during disease progression they become less succeptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
