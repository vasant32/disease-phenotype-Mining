<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five marrow donors were genotypically HLA-identical siblings and 28 were other family members or unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before transplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had either severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or had greater than 5% blasts in the marrow or peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of disease-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality at 4 years were 41%, 28%, and 43%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age and shorter disease duration were significantly associated with improved disease-free survival and decreased non-relapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relapse was seen only in patients with excess blasts at the time of transplantation (51% at 4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than age 40 and without excess blasts had a 4-year disease-free survival of 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that allogeneic marrow transplantation can cure some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the favorable outcome in younger patients without excess blasts, we recommend that transplantation be considered early for patients younger than age 40, before disease progression or development of life-threatening cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For older patients and those with excess blasts, changes in the transplant procedure will be necessary to improve outcome </plain></SENT>
