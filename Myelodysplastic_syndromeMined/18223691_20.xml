<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacodynamic effects of DAC and 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> outside their known activity as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) require further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DAC on the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a gene with a putative CpG island surrounding its promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation analysis of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells revealed the absence of CpG methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, DAC upregulated p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50)=103.34 nM) and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential application of DAC followed by different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors induced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) synergistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) paralleled DAC-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (ED(50)=153 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low doses of DAC induced gamma-H2AX expression (ED(50)=16.5 nM) and upregulated p21(WAF1/CIP1) in congenic HCT 116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in a DNMT-independent and p53-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of p53 transactivation by pifithrin-alpha or the kinase activity of ATM by either the specific ATM inhibitor KU-5593 or <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> abrogated p21(WAF1/CIP1) upregulation, indicating that DAC upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was p53- and ATM-dependent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DAC upregulates p21(WAF1/CIP1) in DNMT-independent manner via the DNA damage/ATM/p53 axis </plain></SENT>
