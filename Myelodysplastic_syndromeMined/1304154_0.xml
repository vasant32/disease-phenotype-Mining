<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A girl, aged 8 years, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The myelogram and bone marrow biopsy showed dyserythropoiesis with macroblastosis, but without sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosome configuration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the negative results of other investigations led to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> without any known cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation was considered, but a spontaneous remission intervened and has persisted for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A girl, aged 5 years, was investigated for worsening of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> that had been present for 3 years, without changes of granulocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The myelogram showed dyserythropoiesis with megaloblastosis and sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No known cause could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As for the preceding patient, a spontaneous remission occurred, and has persisted for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Case 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A girl, aged 5 months, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The myelogram showed dys-megakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hematologic data spontaneously normalized after 1 year, and have remained so 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The spontaneous remission, that has occurred in our 3 patients, has been reported in one only adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This possibility precludes considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in children as preleukemic, and suggests that bone marrow transplantation is not urgent in these situations </plain></SENT>
