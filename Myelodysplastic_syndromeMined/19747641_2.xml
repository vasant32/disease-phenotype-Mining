<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the annual long-term mortality rates of allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients who had survived 5 years or more disease-free posttransplant and calculate their relative survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if they had a first allogeneic or syngeneic HCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or autologous HCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Australia or New Zealand between 1992 and 2001, recorded on the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR) database, and were known to have survived, disease free, 5 years or more posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual mortality rates of 5-year transplant survivors were compared to standard Australian and New Zealand populations using relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1461 HCT survivors (688 postallograft, 773 postautograft) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 10-year survival probability for 5-year allograft survivors was slightly higher than that of 5-year autologous survivors (93.4% versus 89.6%, P=.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative survival of both allogeneic and autologous 5-year survivors was never &lt;97% of that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was statistically significantly lower than expected in the sixth to ninth years posttransplant, with no obvious pattern of either improvement or deterioration from 6 to 10 years posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that annual relative survival rates of long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT performed in Australia and New Zealand for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymophoblastic leukemkia (ALL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are slightly, but significantly lower than population rates in the 6th to 10th years posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Annual relative survival rates of long-term survivors of autologous HCT performed in Australia and New Zealand for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are also slightly lower than population rates up to the 10th year posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from transplant and disease-related causes are unusual, but continue to occur for many years post-HCT </plain></SENT>
