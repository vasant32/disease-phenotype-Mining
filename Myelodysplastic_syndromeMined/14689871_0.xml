<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was comprised of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, and fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells were infused with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was confirmed on day 18, and complete chimera on day 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the patient developed grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD following the transplantation, it responded rapidly to steroid administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subsequent course was uneventful, and he remains well in complete remission in 26 months after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This successful experience suggests that maternal hematopoietic stem cell transplant for children, in specific immune tolerance based on the presence of microchimerism and compatibility of minor histocompatibility antigens between mother and child, may have given rise to the favorable preventing effect against severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
