<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies provide further circumstantial evidence for the involvement of TNF-alpha in apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the marrow cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using our newly developed in situ double-labeling technique that sequentially employs DNA polymerase (DNA Pol) followed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to label cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we have characterized DNA fragmentation patterns during spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow and in HL60 cells treated with TNF-alpha or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clear DNA laddering detected by gel electrophoresis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples confirmed the unique length of apoptotic DNA fragments (180-200 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, however, phenotypically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells as well as the homogenous population of HL60 cells showed three distinct labeling patterns after double labeling--only DNA-Pol reaction, only TdT reaction, and a combined DNA Pol + TdT reaction, albeit in different cohorts of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each labeling pattern was found at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> morphological stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mononuclear cells, during spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 4 hr cultures, showed highest increase in double-labeled cells (DNA Pol + TdT reaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this was paralleled by TNF-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HL60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> treatment of HL60 cells led to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in cells showing only TdT reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The double-labeling technique was applied to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells after treatment with known endonucleases that specifically cause 3' recessed (BamHI), 5' recessed (PstI), or blunt ended (DraI) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was found that the DNA-Pol reaction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and HL60 cells corresponds to 3' recessed DNA fragments, the TdT reaction to 5' recessed and/or blunt ended fragments, and a combined "DNA Pol + TdT reaction" corresponds to a copresence of 3' recessed with 5' recessed and/or blunt ended fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clearly, therefore, apoptotic DNA fragments, in spite of a unique length, may have differently staggered ends that could be cell (or tissue) specific and be selectively triggered by different inducers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of TNF-alpha-inducible apoptotic DNA fragmentation pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> supports its involvement in these disorders and suggests that anti-TNF-alpha (or anticytokine) therapy may be of special benefit to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, where no definitive treatment is yet available </plain></SENT>
