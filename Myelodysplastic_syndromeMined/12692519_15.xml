<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both ITD and D835 mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) gene cause constitutive activation of the receptor, in the absence of ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined a cohort of 91 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (80) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (11), to determine the prevalence of these mutations and any correlations between the two mutations and disease prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FLT3/ITD (ITD+) or D835 mutations (D835+) were not detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, 10% (8/80) and 7.5% (6/80) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were ITD+ and D835+, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ITD+ patients have a higher rate of relapse than patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) FLT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 4.6 months (range 0.6-36.2) for ITD+ and 19.85 months (range 0.2-197.5) for WT patients (P=0.0066), and disease-free survival (DFS) was also worse for ITD+ patients than FLT3/WT patients (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLT3/ITD is also a significant prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) and DFS in patients in the standard karyotype group (P=0.0040, 0.0365, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ITD is more prevalent in patients in the standard karyotype category (7/41, 17.1%) as compared to patients in the poor-risk category (1/32, 3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar to ITD, D835 mutations were found to be more frequent in patients with standard-risk rather than poor-risk cytogenetic category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WBC count (mean 63.8 x 10(9)/l) was significantly higher in ITD+ patients than patients with D835 mutations (mean 34.8 x 10(9)/l) and WT patients (mean 26.4 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>D835 mutants did not appear to have a worse median OS or DFS compared with the WT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FLT3/ITD mutations may be an important prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, especially in the standard/good risk karyotype groups, where it may allow risk-directed therapy </plain></SENT>
