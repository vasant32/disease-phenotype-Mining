<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> are important antileukemia drugs, a Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of VNP40101M was conducted in patients with refractory or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> or poor-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: VNP40101M was given as a single i.v. infusion over 15-70 min on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Courses were repeated every 4 weeks according to antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The starting dose of 220 mg/m(2) was escalated by approximately 33% in cohorts of 3-6 patients until a maximum-tolerated dose was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One additional cohort was treated with the maximum-tolerated dose divided over days 1 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients, including 28 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, received 52 courses of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nondose-limiting, reversible infusion-related toxicities were the most frequent adverse event, occurring in 24 (63%) patients on the first course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation was terminated at 708 mg/m(2) for prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> in 1 of 7 patients, and 600 mg/m(2) was selected as the recommended Phase II dose, with no significant extramedullary toxicity at this dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with 300 mg/m(2) and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> treated with 600 mg/m(2), achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VNP40101M had significant antileukemic activity and minimal extramedullary toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory disease </plain></SENT>
