<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To further classify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> as diagnosed by use of a general classification scheme and to determine clinical features and laboratory test results that could be used to differentiate between the various forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sample Population-Bone marrow slides from 34 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Medical records of cats in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> was diagnosed on the basis of blood and bone marrow analyses from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria for inclusion in the study were findings of &gt; 10% dysplastic cells in 1 or more hematologic cell lines in the bone marrow and concurrent cytopenias in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cats that met these criteria were classified into subcategories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> on the basis of reevaluation of slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 189 bone marrow slides reviewed, 34 (14.9%) had &gt; 10% dysplastic cells in 1 or more cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cats were subcategorized as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with excessive numbers of blast cells (n = 13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with refractory cytopenias (8), a variant form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1), and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> (12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoiesis</z:e> and autoagglutination in cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and in those with immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> complicated differentiating between the 2 conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Differentiating cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> from cats with immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> was difficult because severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and autoagglutination may be concurrent findings in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differentiating between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with excessive numbers of blast cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with refractory cytopenias was useful in predicting clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
