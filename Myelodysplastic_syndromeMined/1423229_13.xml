<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic data obtained with G-banding were in accord with those obtained by FISH to metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most significantly, FISH to interphase nuclei offered reliable results and in some cases provided important information concerning crucial chromosome anomalies which were not or could not be completely detected by analyzing metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that FISH could be clinically valuable in five major areas: 1) marker chromosome identification; 2) identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> consistent with certain specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0004377'>hematological neoplasms</z:hpo>; 3) clonal evaluation post observation of a single cell with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>; 4) clonal evaluation post-sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT); and 5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> detection following clinical remission </plain></SENT>
