<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of the centromeres of chromosomes 17 and 20 in the dic(17;20), as well as the loss of TP53, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 17p and 20q are recurrent abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a dic(17;20) is an uncommon finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the few reports in the literature, dic(17;20) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The key mechanism might be the loss of TP53 as well as other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in 20q that may have a critical role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genesis </plain></SENT>
