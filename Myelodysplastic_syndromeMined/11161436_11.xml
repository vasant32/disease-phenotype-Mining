<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) blasts to mediate costimulatory signals during T lymphocyte activation was investigated in an experimental model where monoclonal T cell populations were stimulated with standardized activation signals (anti-CD3, anti-CD2, and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies and phytohemagglutinin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferative T cell responses were detected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (n = 16) when irradiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts were used as accessory cells during activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cell cytokine release was also observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients when nonirradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> accessory cells were used, and for most patients a broad cytokine response (interleukin (IL) 2, IL4, IL10, IL13, and interferon-gamma) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, both T cell proliferation and cytokine release showed a wide variation among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, and T cell responsiveness was in addition dependent both on the nature of the activation signal and on differences between individual T cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accessory cell function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts showed no correlation with the release of any single immunomodulatory soluble mediator (IL1beta, IL6, TNF-alpha, soluble IL2 receptors) or the expression of any particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>/costimulatory membrane molecule (CD54, CD58, CD80, and CD86) by the blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, blocking studies with anti-CD58 and anti-CD80/86 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that both pathways can be involved when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts are used as accessory cells, but the relative importance and the final effects of signaling through these pathways differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there is a wide interpatient variation, we conclude that for a majority of patients the native <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts can mediate adequate costimulatory signals needed for accessory cell-dependent T cell activation </plain></SENT>
