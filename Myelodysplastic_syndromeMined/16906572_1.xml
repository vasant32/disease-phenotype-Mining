<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of ZAP-70 in immature B-cells is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immature or precursor B lymphocytes (hematogones) often occur in clinical samples and coexpress CD10, CD38, and CD19 lacking surface immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out in an attempt to further elucidate the role of ZAP-70 in the spectrum of B-cells seen in clinical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ZAP-70 expression was evaluated on 25 patient samples that expressed greater than 2% of CD10(+)/CD38(bright)/CD19(+) coexpression during routine evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our sample set, the hematogone expression ranged from 2 to 18% of total leukocytes and occurred in a variety of conditions, including CLL, NHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkins Disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>Multiple Myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method of ZAP-70 detection was that routinely applied to our clinical testing of CLL samples supplemented with the determination of ZAP-70 levels in the CD38(bright)/CD19(+) coexpressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases ZAP-70 was not expressed on the CD5 negative, CD38/CD19 coexpressing precusor B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases hematogones were found to not express significant levels of ZAP-70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of hematogones in clinical samples should be recognized so as to not adversely influence prognostic studies of ZAP-70 or CD38 in CLL </plain></SENT>
