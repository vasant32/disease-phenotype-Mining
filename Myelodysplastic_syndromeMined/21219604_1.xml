<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But their use is associated with increased incidences of bone marrow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> has emerged as a potential DNA demethylating agent for clinical translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> is much safer than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>, it requires high concentrations to be effective in DNA demethylation in suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516170" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer cell growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, our laboratories have embarked on the pharmacological exploitation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> to develop potent DNA methylation inhibitors through lead optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the use of a DNA methylation two-component enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter system as a screening platform to identify novel DNA methylation inhibitors from a compound library containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A lead agent IM25, which exhibits substantially higher potency in GSTp1 DNA demethylation with lower cytotoxicity in MCF7 cells relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>, was identified by the screening platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a proof-of-concept that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> could be pharmacologically exploited to develop novel DNA methylation inhibitors, of which the translational potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy/prevention is currently under investigation </plain></SENT>
