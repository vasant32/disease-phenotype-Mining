<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the ETV6 gene rearrangement in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and explore its relationship with prognosis and disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ETV6 rearrangement in 58 MDS cases were detected by conventional cytogenetics and Split-signal FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was used to detect 9p24-12p13 balance translocation with special designed primers ETV6F1/F2 and JAK2R1/R2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between ETV6 rearrangement and prognosis and disease staging in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ETV6 rearrangement were found in 4 (6.9%) of 58 cases, among which ETV6/JAK2 fusion was identified by RT-PCR in 1 (1.7%) case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients (100%) with rearrangement transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, with a median survival time (MS) of 7 months; while 10 patients (17%) in the non-translocation group transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, with a MS of 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients (100%) with rearrangement were in advanced stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>( <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), while 17 cases (31.5%) in non-rearrangement group were in that stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ETV6 rearrangement has higher expression rate (6.9%), and is closely associated with disease stage and prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
