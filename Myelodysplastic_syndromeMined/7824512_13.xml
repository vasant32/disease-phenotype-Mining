<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>This study sought to answer two questions: (a) How wide is the range of cytological features and immunoreactivity of the cutaneous infiltrates and what danger is there of misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>(b) What are the possible causes of the wide spectrum of differentiation of the cells infiltrating the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens from 16 patients with myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (M4, according to the French-American-British/FAB system of classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>) in eight cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (M5) in four cases, aleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cutis as a recurrence of M2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after treatment in one case, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in three cases, including one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with an excess of bone marrow blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, one of which presented as aleukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cutis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity with the macrophage-associated antibodies anti-CD68, Ki-M1p, and anti-lysozyme was the most consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> AS-D chloroacetate esterase reaction and staining with DAKO-M1, Ki-My2p, anti-neutrophil elastase, and anti-CD34 were found to be of little value for identifying the cutaneous infiltrate as myelogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some antibodies (e.g., anti-S100 protein and MB2) even produced staining in a few cases that could have led to a mistaken diagnosis of histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
