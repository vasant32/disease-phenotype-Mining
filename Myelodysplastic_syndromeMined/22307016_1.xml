<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we increased the dose of r-ATG to 5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we analyzed 87 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) undergoing allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor from 2000 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RIC consisted of fludarabine, BU and r-ATG 2.5 mg/kg on 1 day (r-ATG1; n=53) or 2.5 mg/kg per day over 2 days (r-ATG2; n=22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD incidence at day 100 was 30.2% and 8.8% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD incidence was 60.4% and 12% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse incidences (RI) at 24 months were 18.9% and 28.5% in r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.640) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall and PFS were not different between the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>r-ATG dose at 5 mg/kg in the setting of RIC seems a good balance allowing GVHD prevention and antitumor effect with a remarkable reduction of GVHD incidence without an identical level of increased relapse rate </plain></SENT>
