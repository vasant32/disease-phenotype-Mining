<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, cytoreductive therapeutic options are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A relatively new therapy is <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> receptor radionuclide therapy with the radiolabeled somatostatin analog [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the toxicity and efficacy of this treatment, performed in over 500 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated up to a cumulative dose of 750 to 800 mCi (27.8-29.6 GBq), usually in four treatment cycles, with treatment intervals of 6 to 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity analysis was done in 504 patients, and efficacy analysis in 310 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Any hematologic toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurred after 3.6% of administrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events that were likely attributable to the treatment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in three patients, and temporary, nonfatal, liver toxicity in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete and partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> remissions occurred in 2% and 28% of 310 GEPNET patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response (decrease in size &gt; 25% and &lt; 50%) occurred in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median OS from start of treatment was 46 months, median OS from diagnosis was 128 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with historical controls, there was a survival benefit of 40 to 72 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate has few adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> response rates and progression-free survival compare favorably to the limited number of alternative treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Compared with historical controls, there is a benefit in OS from time of diagnosis of several years </plain></SENT>
