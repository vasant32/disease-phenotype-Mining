<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We devised a new microfluorometric method for determining the ploidy of megakaryocytes identified immunologically in bone marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The smears were immunostained by incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (GP) IIb antibodies, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were then stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytes were identified by their GPIIb immunofluorescence using a microfluorometer and, after the filters were changed, their DNA content was assayed by measuring the intensity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This intensity was shown to be proportional to the DNA content when the aperture of the objective lens was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared these results with those obtained when megakaryocytes were identified morphologically, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> staining after Wright-Giemsa destaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the ploidy peaks were shown to be <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36936">16N</z:chebi> by both methods, and the mean ploidy detected by the immunological method was only reduced 0.961 times relative to the estimate from the morphological method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients, the ploidy peaks were either 8N or 4N and the mean was reduced by 0.906 times (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus we could immunologically identify small megakaryocytes which we could not identify morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this method is useful for measuring megakaryocytic ploidy, especially in the pathological megakaryocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
