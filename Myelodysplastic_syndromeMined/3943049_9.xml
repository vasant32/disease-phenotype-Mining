<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosome #12 abnormality was a partial deletion in 15 patients and a translocation in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 12p- was the sole chromosomal abnormality in seven patients (four with de novo ANLL) and was associated with other chromosome abnormalities in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 12p was often associated with other chromosomal changes and was a secondary abnormality in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequences of this hemizygosity for genes located at 12p are discussed with references to the possible expression of a potentially mutated recessive gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of c-K-ras 2, normally located at 12p, must be done in such cases, as the association of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorders</z:e> and multiple chromosome abnormalities suggests a possible mutation of this c-oncogene on chromosome #12 </plain></SENT>
