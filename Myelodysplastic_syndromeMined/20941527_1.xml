<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the study on the systems reported herein could provide a good basis for designing aza <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> systems that are less hydrophilic than their parental drugs and can be used, in different dosage forms, to release the parent drug in a controlled manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, based on the calculated log EM, the cleavage process for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> 1ProD is predicted to be about 10¹⁰ times faster than that for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> 7ProD and about 10⁴ times faster than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> 3ProD: rate( 1ProD ) &gt; rate( 3ProD ) &gt; rate( 7ProD ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, the rate by which the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> releases the aza <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> drug can be determined according to the structural features of the linker (Kirby's enzyme model) </plain></SENT>
