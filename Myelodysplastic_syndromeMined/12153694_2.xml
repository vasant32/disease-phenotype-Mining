<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis of primary or idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> remains unknown, it has been proposed that a deficiency or loss of responsiveness of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e>, especially in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report on an adult with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD16+ CD14dim monocytes comprise 5-10% of circulating monocytes in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of the patient in the present study revealed increased CD16+ CD14dim monocytes in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the expression of CD16 and CD14 is regulated by macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, serum cytokines were analysed in our patient and the concentration of serum GM-CSF was found to be less than the lower limit of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum M-CSF and granulocyte colony stimulating factor levels were only slightly increased above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increase in the CD16+ CD14dim subpopulation in the circulation of our patient indicates another pathogenetic mechanism for secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>, such as hyperresponsiveness of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to these cytokines </plain></SENT>
