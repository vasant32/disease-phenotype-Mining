<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: In order to assess a "basic" comparison between needle biopsy (B) and aspirate (A) in terms of diagnostic efficacy two hundred consecutive samples of bone marrow from 180 patients with simple (non neoplastic) peripheral cytopenia were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both B and A from the identical anatomical site (posterior superior iliac spine) were performed in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histology (I) and cytology (C) were systematically prepared from B (IB and CB) and from A (IA and CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were subdivided in 7 groups according to the type of cytopenia (mono-bi-trilinear) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a nosologic point of view these corresponded to common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As far as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (MD) is concerned only <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MD represented 28.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> which in turn covered 63.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic significance of I and C referred to the final diagnosis (A + B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each group were compared (vs) A (CA + IA) vs B (IB + CB), IB vs CA, CA vs IA,IB vs CB and IB vs IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results were expressed by putting each related case into one of the following three cathegories: equivalence, superiority, inferiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Equivalence could be diagnostically significant or non significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combination I + C was diagnostic in 100% of cases for A + B and IB + CA, in 96.5% for CA + IA, in 92.5% for IB + CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination IB + IA was significant in 99.5% of samples, similarly supported by IB and IA respectively accounting for 91.0% and 90.0 of diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individually CA was diagnostic in 92.0% and CB in 80.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In some istances uneffective CA was implemented by IA (4.5%) and analogously IB by CB (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Within A CA gave little more significance than IA (only +2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The different rates of I + C coincident diagnostic significance were: 97.5% (A + B), 85.5% (CA + IA), 83.0% (IB + CA), 79.0% (IB + CB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In 25.0% of MD cases diagnosis was assured by A only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In case of diagnostic discrepancy the classical morphologic parameters as cellularity, linearity and cytological details were also comparatively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) the data above mentioned measure the diagnostic efficacy of the various procedures, individually or in association, with reference to the examined area, but they can be "basically" significant in the perspective of other comparisons; 2) as a whole B and A showed diagnostic equivalence, but A was more contributory in RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>; this methologically means that CA needs to be reappraised and that IA is very reliable; 3) association I + C seems to be the best procedural approach in order to provide complementary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and amplified availability of material for examination, diagnosis and further study; 4) the performance of histopathologist can be improved by simultaneous cytological evaluation </plain></SENT>
