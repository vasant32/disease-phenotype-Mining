<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 43 patients received only PC therapy for 12 weeks, after which 18 of 36 nonresponders received PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 of 43 patients showed a hematologic or cytogenetic response or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BM TNF-alpha levels were semiquantitatively assessed using immunohistochemistry on a scale of 0-8+ and in the serum using enzyme linked immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median TNF-alpha for the entire group was 3.0 in BM and 6.9 pg/ml in the serum, and 14 patients had no detectable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders had higher BM levels (median 3.5 vs. 2.0) than nonresponders, although this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During PC therapy, a decline in BM TNF-alpha level was seen in the entire group, which was significant at 2 weeks (p = 0.02), 8 weeks (p = 0.001), and 12 weeks (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both responders (p = 0.01) and nonresponders (p = 0.03) had a decline at 8 weeks, but at 12 weeks, only the responders continued to show a significant decline (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high BM TNF-alpa levels have a better chance of responding to PCD therapy and that the therapy is quite successful in reducing the TNF-alpha levels in a sustained fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to be directed at identifying agents that would be more potent suppressors of the proapoptotic cytokines in these patients </plain></SENT>
