<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation with the patient's haematological characteristics, their FAB subtypes (i.e., 6 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 11 of acquired sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), 15 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 5 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) and 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), and the survival were examined as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique used for cell culture was that of Pike and Robinson, following the classification proposed by Florensa for estimating the growth patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anomalies of the myeloid clonal proliferation were found in 81% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was direct correlation between the number of aggregates and the polymorphonuclear cell count, whereas the highest number of blast cells coincided with increased number of clusters in cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNNL showed the highest aggregate counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B growth pattern (both colony and aggregate growth) was most frequently seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>; pattern C2 (decreased colonies with increased aggregate count) appeared in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and pattern C3 (decrease of both colony and aggregate counts) was found only in RA and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
