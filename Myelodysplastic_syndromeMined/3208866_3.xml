<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 24 cases with chromosome anomalies, of whom 10 had del (5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4 of these had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) with 5q- as the sole anomaly (group A), 2 had RA with 5q- and additional chromosome anomalies consisting of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (group B); 3 patients had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and complex, karyotypic changes also including 5q- (group B) </plain></SENT>
