<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In March 1997 an international workshop introduced a new International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to apply the IPSS to a large group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from one centre and to compare it to the FAB-classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred eighty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were included on the basis of similar criteria as used by the workshop but some of them (30) received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-type therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IPSS separated our patients into distinctive prognostic subgroups (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was respectively 6.5, 2.6, 1.3 and 0.75 years for the low-risk (22% of patients), the intermediate-1-risk (INT-1) (46%), the intermediate-2-risk (INT-2) (25%) and the high-risk group (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IPSS also discriminated within each of the FAB-categories: RA patients (58 patients) were present in low-risk, INT-1-risk and INT-2-risk subgroups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients (23) were separated into low-risk and INT-1-risk subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients (53) were distributed predominantly between INT-1-risk and INT-2-risk groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t patients (23) between INT-2-risk and high-risk subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients (27) were present in the low-risk, the INT-1-risk and the INT-2-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the effectiveness of the IPSS in predicting clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and indicate that it is an improved method compared to the FAB-classification </plain></SENT>
