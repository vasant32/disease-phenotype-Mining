<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing numbers of women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> have also received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these growth factors support chemotherapy, their long-term safety has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between G-CSF use and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in a population-based sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among women aged 65 years or older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed with stages I-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 1999, we identified those who received G-CSF or GM-CSF concurrently with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios for the association of treatment with G-CSF or GM-CSF and subsequent (through December 31, 2003) diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5510 women treated with chemotherapy, 906 (16%) received G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy, and 64 (1.16%) were subsequently diagnosed with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> before a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of G-CSF and GM-CSF was associated with more recent diagnosis, younger age, urban residence, fewer comorbidities, receipt of radiation therapy, positive lymph nodes, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 906 patients who were treated with G-CSF, 16 (1.77%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; of the 4604 patients not treated with G-CSF, 48 (1.04%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hazard rate ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among those treated with G-CSF or GM-CSF compared with those who were not was 2.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12 to 4.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed within 48 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis in 1.8% of patients who received G-CSF or GM-CSF but only in 0.7% of patients who did not (hazard ratio = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.30 to 5.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of G-CSF was associated with a doubling in the risk of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among the population that we studied, although the absolute risk remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even if this association is confirmed, the benefits of G-CSF may still outweigh the risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, however, G-CSF use should not be assumed to be risk free </plain></SENT>
