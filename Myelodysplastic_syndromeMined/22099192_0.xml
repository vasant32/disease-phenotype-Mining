<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 23 cases of CAA and 9 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from September 2007 to September 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical data including routine blood test results, reticulocyte counts, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, serum ferritin level, cytological examination of bone marrow, bone marrow CD34+ cell counts, bone marrow chromosome and FISH test results were compared between the CAA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neutrophils, reticulocytes, and serum ferritin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase levels increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group compared with those in the CAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in bone marrow blast cell counts and dyshematopoiesis phenomena of three lines blood cells between the CAA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow CD34+ cell counts and the rate of chromosomal abnormalities detected in bone marrow cytogenetic analysis in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group were significantly higher than those in the CAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in the results of laboratory examinations and morphological and cytogenetic examinations of bone marrow between the children with CAA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences are useful to the differential diagnosis of the two diseases </plain></SENT>
