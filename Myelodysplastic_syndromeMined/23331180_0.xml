<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) are characterised by <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism driving this excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involves multiple immune molecules, including inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is the hallmark cytokine produced by CD4(+) Th17 cells, and IL-17 mediates activation of the adaptive T-cell response inducing an inflammatory cytokine environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of IL-17 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study, and the levels of IL-17 and IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) in BM mononuclear cells (BMNCs) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, BMNCs were stimulated with recombinant human IL-17 (rhIL-17), and flow cytometry was used to analyse the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD4(+) and CD(+) T lymphocytes from patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterisation of IL-17 expression in patients with the HLA-DR15 allele or hypocellularity was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for both IL-17 and the IL-17R subunits in BMNCs and for IL-17 in the BM and plasma were higher in patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as compared to patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes from patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be enhanced by recombinant human IL-17 (rhIL-17) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased IL-17 expression was associated with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated IL-17 levels and IL-17-induced IFN-γ and TNF-α overproduction may be involved in the pathogenesis of lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
