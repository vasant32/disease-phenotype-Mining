<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognosis for women with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 10 or more involved axillary lymph nodes is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been reported to be effective in the adjuvant setting for patients at high risk for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned 540 female patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and at least 10 involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes to receive either six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and fluorouracil (CAF) or the same adjuvant chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and thiotepa and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 511 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival, overall survival, or the time to recurrence between those who received CAF alone and those who received CAF plus high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 417 patients fulfilling strict eligibility criteria, the time to recurrence was longer for patients who underwent stem-cell transplantation than for those who received CAF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the transplantation group, nine patients died of transplantation-related complications and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> developed in nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with CAF may reduce the risk of relapse but does not improve the outcome among patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and at least 10 involved axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional-dose adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care for such patients </plain></SENT>
