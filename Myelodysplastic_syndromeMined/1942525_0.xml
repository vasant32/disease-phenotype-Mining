<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with underlying disorders, blast count of more than 5% on bone marrow (BM) aspirate, blast count of more than 1% on peripheral blood or ringed sideroblast count of more than 15% on BM aspirate were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to Yoshida's criteria, 23 patients were classified into 6 subtypes [AA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>)1: typical AA, AA2: atypical AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>)3: typical RA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, MDS4-6: atypical RA], and AA1 7 cases; AA2 2 cases; MDS3 5 cases; MDS4 1 case; MDS5 2 cases; MDS6 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinical features of atypical RA group (MDS4-6), we investigated ferrokinetics, RBC life span, karyotype, serum Epo (erythropoietin) concentration, response to therapy and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were as follows: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three RA patients who were younger than 30 years old were included in atypical RA group, 2) in ferrokinetics study <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> (plasma iron disappearance time) values of MDS4 and MDS6 patients ranged between those of AA1 and those of MDS3 patients (5 of 7 patients), 3) two cases who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> belonged to typical RA group, 4) patients with atypical RA showed response to therapy and their prognosis were better than those with typical RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that atypical RA have different clinical features from typical RA </plain></SENT>
