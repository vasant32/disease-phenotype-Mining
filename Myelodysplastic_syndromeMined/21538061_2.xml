<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase II multicenter study was undertaken to estimate the efficacy of belinostat, a potent inhibitor of both class I and class II HDAC enzymes, for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ≤2 prior therapies were treated with belinostat 1,000 mg/m(2) IV on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a proportion of confirmed responses during the first 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responding patients could receive additional cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were enrolled, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were a median 13.4 months from diagnosis, and 14 patients (67%) had less than 5% bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (81%) were transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior therapy included azacytidine (n = 7) and chemotherapy (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with a median of four cycles (range, 1-8) of belinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was one confirmed response-hematologic improvement in neutrophils-for an overall response rate of 5% (95% CI, 0.2-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 17.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grades 3-4 toxicities considered at least to be possibly related to belinostat were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (n = 2), febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 1), and QTc prolongation (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
