<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To increase the stem cell content of T cell-depleted bone marrow transplants (BMT), we treated 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> with BMT from HLA-identical sibling donors given G-CSF 10 microg/kg/day for 5 days before marrow harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After CD34+ cell selection, patients received a median of 1.7 (range, 0.82-3.1) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and 2.3 (range, 0.25-4.0) x 10(5) CD3+ cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had initial engraftment but four developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> between days 55-130 post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, this required a second infusion of G-CSF-mobilized donor peripheral blood progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed no delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in a matched historical group of 24 patients receiving T cell-depleted BMT without prior G-CSF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to this control group, G-CSF-stimulated marrow recipients showed a significant decline in neutrophil and monocyte counts after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, outcome after BMT was otherwise comparable, with a similar incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was 63 vs 67% for controls matched for CD34+ cell dose (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that G-CSF stimulation can increase the CD34+ cell content of T cell-depleted marrow but carries a risk of late graft failure </plain></SENT>
