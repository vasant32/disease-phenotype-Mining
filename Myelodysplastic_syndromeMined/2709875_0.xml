<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resultant megakaryocyte colonies were expressed as a plasma factor index megakaryocyte (PFI-Mk) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PFI-Mk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was significantly lower than PFI-Mk (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), both with and without EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between megakaryocyte and platelet count in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but was not present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between platelet count and PFI-Mk in neither group </plain></SENT>
