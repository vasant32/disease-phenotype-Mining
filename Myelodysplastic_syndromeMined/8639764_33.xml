<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro marrow culture data have indicated that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the production of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to treat the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in this disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were treated with a combination of recombinant human EPO and recombinant human G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients were enrolled in the study of which 53 (96%) had a neutrophil response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients were evaluable for an erythroid response of which 21 (48%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An erythroid response was significantly more likely in those patients with relatively low serum EPO levels, higher absolute basal reticulocyte counts and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (81%) of the patients who responded to combined G-CSF plus EPO therapy continued to respond during an 8-week maintenance phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was then discontinued and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' neutrophil responses were diminished, whereas 8 continued to have an erythroid response to EPO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 7 of the remaining 9 patients, resumption of G-CSF was required for recurrent erythroid responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median duration of erythroid responses to these cytokines was 11 months, with 6 patients having relatively prolonged and durable responses for 15 to 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicate that approximately one half of responding patients require both G-CSF and EPO to maintain an effective erythroid response, suggesting that synergy between G-CSF and EPO exists in vivo for the production of red blood cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
