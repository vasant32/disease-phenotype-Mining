<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of -7/7q- with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suggests that these regions contain novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene(s), whose loss of function contribute to leukemic transformation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on chromosome banding analysis, two critical regions have been identified, one in band q22 and another in bands q32-q35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presently there are no data available on the molecular delineation of the distal critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we analyzed bone marrow and blood samples from 13 patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>], n = 3; de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>], n = 9; therapy-related (t-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, n = 1) which, on chromosome banding analysis, exhibited deletions (n = 12) or in one case a balanced translocation involving bands 7q31-qter using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As probes we used representative clones from a contig map of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that spans chromosome bands 7q31.1-qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 12 cases with loss of 7q material, we identified a commonly deleted region of approximately 4 to 5 megabasepairs in size encompassing the distal part of 7q35 and the proximal part of 7q36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the breakpoint of the reciprocal translocation from the patient with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was localized to a 1,300-kb sized YAC clone that maps to the proximal boundary of the commonly deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in this case both homologs of chromosome 7 were affected: one was lost (-7) and the second exhibited the t(7q35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification and delineation of translocation and deletion breakpoints provides the first step toward the identification of the gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of 7q35-q36 aberrations in myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
