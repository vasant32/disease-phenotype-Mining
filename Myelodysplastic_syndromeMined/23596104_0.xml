<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: this phase II prospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5 days Azacytidine (5d-AZA) in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondly, SNP genetic profile and PI-PLCbeta1 levels were studied to evaluate possible biological markers able to predict the hematologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental design: the study tested a lower intensity schedule of AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment plan consisted on 75 mg/sqm/day subcutaneous administered for 5 days every 28, for a total of 8 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) was 47% (15/32) on intention to treat and 58% (15/26) for patients completing the treatment program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this latter group, 5 (19%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 10 (38%) had hematological improvement (HI), according to the IWG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients have maintained their HI after 37, 34 and 33 months without other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 21 and 2 of the 26 cases completing 8 cycles were transfusion dependent for red blood cells and platelets at baseline, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 7 (33%) and 2 (100%) became transfusion-independent at the end of the treatment program, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 28% of patients and four patients died early due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SNP results were not significantly correlated to the clinical outcome, whilst PI-PLCbeta1 level anticipated either positive or negative clinical responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 5d-AZA is safe and effective in a proportion of low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PI-PLCbeta1 gene expression is a reliable and dynamic marker of response that can be useful to optimize AZA therapy </plain></SENT>
