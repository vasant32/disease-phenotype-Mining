<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: An 8 month-old girl was admitted because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The marrow aspirate showed dysgranulopoiesis and partial interruption of maturation after the myelocyte level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow biopsy revealed reticulinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The condition worsened with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigations ruled out malignant hemopathy, metastatic infiltration of the marrow and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0419203,C0005940" disease_type="Health Care Activity;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was discussed, but presence of anti-granulocyte auto-antibodies and positive Coombs test led to consider an autoimmune etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy was attempted, effective only on the platelet lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of intravenous gammaglobulin therapy corrected the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a 24 month-course of the disease, it was necessary to prolong therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The efficacy of gammaglobulins may be an additional argument for auto-immunity, although no other auto-immune pattern has been observed in our patient, contrary to reported cases in adults </plain></SENT>
