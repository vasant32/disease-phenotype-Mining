<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria biogenesis requires the import of several precursor proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) machinery components are highly conserved among eukaryotes, including humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the functional properties of human mtHsp70 machinery components have not been characterized among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eukaryotic families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the functional interactions, we have reconstituted the components of the mtHsp70 chaperone machine (Hsp70/J-protein/GrpE/Hep) and systematically analyzed in vitro conditions for biochemical functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that the sequence-specific interaction of human mtHsp70 toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> client proteins differs significantly from its yeast counterpart Ssc1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the helical lid of human mtHsp70 was found dispensable to the binding of P5 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> as compared with the other Hsp70s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that the two human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrix J-protein splice variants differentially regulate the mtHsp70 chaperone cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, our results demonstrated that human Hsp70 escort protein (Hep) possesses a unique ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 as well as to prevent the aggregation of unfolded client proteins similar to J-proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed that Hep binds with the C terminus of mtHsp70 in a full-length context and this interaction is distinctly different from unfolded client-specific or J-protein binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the interaction of Hep at the C terminus of mtHsp70 is regulated by the helical lid region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the interaction of Hep at the ATPase domain of the human mtHsp70 is mutually exclusive with J-proteins, thus promoting a similar conformational change that leads to ATPase stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we highlight the biochemical defects of the mtHsp70 mutant (G489E) associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
