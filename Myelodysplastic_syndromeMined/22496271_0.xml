<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about alterations in signal transduction pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to evaluate the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and STAT5 specifically in defined CD34(+), CD45(+), or CD71(+)CD45(-) bone marrow (BM) cells from 60 MDS cases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, both at baseline and following stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD71(+)CD45(-) cells from a subpopulation of 36 MDS cases who were predicted to be responsive by clinical parameters (endogenous erythropoietin levels, transfusion dependency, percentage of blasts in the BM), erythropoietin failed to activate ERK1/2 or STAT5 in 23 of 36 cases, but it was effective in 13 of 36 cases, although to a significantly lower degree than in CD71(+)CD45(-) cells from healthy donor BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The erythropoietin response in vivo correlated with in vitro erythropoietin-dependent STAT5 activation in 20 of 22 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STAT5 was significantly activated at baseline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, whereas caspase-3 was activated in CD34(+) and CD45(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, and was activated more often in the RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF stimulation activated ERK1/2 and STAT5 equally in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the response to growth factors are restricted to erythropoietin stimulation in CD71(+)CD45(-) cells and correlate with the clinical response to erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation of baseline signal transduction for proliferative and apoptotic signals is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but with different patterns among the various BM subpopulations </plain></SENT>
