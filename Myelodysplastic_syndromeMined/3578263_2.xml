<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to define its therapeutic mechanism by assessing clinical and cytogenetic responses to treatment in conjunction with careful in vitro study of both morphologic and functional characteristics of bone marrow cells cultured with Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (12 ANLL, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and 11 of 12 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four had a meaningful clinical response while five more showed in vivo leukemic cell sensitivity to low-dose Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells with cytogenetic abnormalities were either decreased in number or eradicated during clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liquid culture of marrow mononuclear cells with Ara-C (.033-.333 micrograms/ml X 7 days) produced little evidence of morphologic or functional differentiation (ten of 11 studied) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No functional maturation was observed in cells from clinically responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low-dose Ara-C is modestly effective for some patients with ANLL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence for in vivo leukemic differentiation is suggested by either in vitro culture studies or cytogenetic correlates of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vitro marrow culture studies failed to predict clinical response to Ara-C </plain></SENT>
