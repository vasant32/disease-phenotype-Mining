<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Skin manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsing polychondritis</z:e> (RP) are usually nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report a series of patients with RP who presented with annular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and histologic features and follow-up data of patients with RP and an annular urticarial eruption were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients (9 male, 1 female) (mean age 63.7 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had tense, fixed, urticarial papules with an annular configuration predominantly located on the upper part of the trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>Skin lesions</z:mp> occurred before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100662'>chondritis</z:hpo> in 7 of 10 cases with a mean delay of 23 ± 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination consistently showed a lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with no leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, even when biopsies were repeated during the evolution (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic abnormalities were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was found in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, although <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> recurred during the decrease of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> doses in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients died during the evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Retrospective case series design is a limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Annular and papular fixed urticarial eruption may represent a characteristic skin manifestation of RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is frequently associated with hematologic abnormalities and may auger a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
