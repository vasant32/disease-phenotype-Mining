<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune syndromes may occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but they are not a major clinical feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have analysed the global antibody repertoires of IgM and IgG in plasma of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> toward self- and non-self-antigens by quantitative immunoblotting </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the antibody repertoires of self-reactive IgM and IgG of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exhibit significantly altered patterns of reactivity, as compared to those of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reactivity patterns of IgM in plasma of patients and of healthy controls toward non-self-antigens were similar, whereas reactivity patterns of IgG of patients and healthy subjects toward non-self-antigens were discriminated by multiparametric statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that a broad disturbance of self-recognition mechanisms is a general feature of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A failure in the regulation of self-reactivity may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
