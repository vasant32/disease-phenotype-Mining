<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Declining donor CD3 chimaerism beyond day+100 was treated with pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 53.0 years (range: 19-72 years), and the median follow-up was 690 d (range:168-1470 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving full CD3 donor chimaerism (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>, n = 46) by day+100 had a significantly inferior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to patients with mixed donor chimaerism (MDC, n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had stable MDC and did not require pDLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients attaining early <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> had a higher transplant-related mortality compared to those who maintained stable levels of MDC (P = 0.02), with no difference between the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and pDLI groups (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in relapse between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (P = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only CD3 chimaerism status at day+100 and disease status at transplantation had a significant effect on DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> undergoing alemetuzumab based-RIC HSCT, prolonged MDC beyond day+100 is associated with an improved OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to be directed towards establishing the underlying factors that dictate T-cell engraftment, expansion and homing post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
