<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has not been fully investigated among people exposed to ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk and radiation dose-response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by using two databases of Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors: 64,026 people with known exposure distance in the database of Nagasaki University Atomic-Bomb Disease Institute (ABDI) and 22,245 people with estimated radiation dose in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Life Span Study (LSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed from 1985 to 2004 were identified by record linkage between the cohorts and the Nagasaki Prefecture <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox and Poisson regression models were used to estimate relationships between exposure distance or dose and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 151 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the ABDI cohort and 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the LSS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> rate increased inversely with exposure distance, with an excess relative risk (ERR) decay per km of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.0; P &lt; .001) for ABDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk also showed a significant linear response to exposure dose level (P &lt; .001) with an ERR per Gy of 4.3 (95% CI, 1.6 to 9.5; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sex, attained age, and birth year, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk was significantly greater in those exposed when young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant linear radiation dose-response for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> exists in atomic bomb survivors 40 to 60 years after radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should perform careful long-term follow-up of irradiated people to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as early as possible </plain></SENT>
