<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 57 years, and 22 (59%) were beyond the early phase of their disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 297 days (355 days in 24 survivors), the 1-year probability of transplant-related mortality was 5%, and the 1-year progression-free survival was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1-year incidence of disease progression in patients with and without GVHD was 13% (95% CI, 4%-34%) and 58% (95% CI, 36%-96%), respectively (P =.008) </plain></SENT>
