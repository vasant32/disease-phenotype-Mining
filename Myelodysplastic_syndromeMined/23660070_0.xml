<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have suggested a role for progenitor assays as a potentially useful test for diagnosis and predicting response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the results of BFU-E assays in 48 consultative cases of single or multi-lineage cytopenias with cellular marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final diagnoses included 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); 9 patients with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) [non-large granular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (LGL) in etiology]; 15 patients with LGL (8 of which had a single lineage cytopenia only while the other 7 had multi-lineage cytopenias); and 7 patients with cytopenias associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> related to autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, nonmalignant diseases were well-distinguished from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by BFU-E growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that low BFU-E growth (less than 10 BFU-E /10(5) marrow mononuclear cells) helps to exclude LGL, PRCA, or cytopenias associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with a sensitivity of 96.8%, specificity of 76.5% and a predictive value of 88.2% (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BFU-E growth was also examined to predict response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 patients in this cohort treated with immunosuppressive therapy across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease groups, there was an 86% response rate with 25 responders (11 PRs and 14 CRs) and 4 non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This did correlate with higher BFU-E growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest BFU-E assays are a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and management of cytopenias in the setting of a normocellular or hypercellular bone marrows </plain></SENT>
