<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The understanding of pathological processes is based on the comparison between physiological and pathological conditions, and transcriptomic analysis has been extensively applied to various diseases for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the way in which the transcriptomic data of pathological cells relate to the transcriptomes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular counterparts has not been fully explored, and may provide new and unbiased insights into the mechanisms of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a method to simultaneously analyse components across different levels, namely genes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we propose a multidimensional method that visualises the cross-level relationships between these components at three different levels based on transcriptomic data of physiological and pathological processes, by adapting Canonical Correspondence Analysis, which was developed in ecology and sociology, to microarray data (CCA on Microarray data, CCAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using CCAM, we have analysed transcriptomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> and those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoietic cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, by analysing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> data, CCAM successfully visualised known relationships between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> subtypes and cellular differentiation, and their characteristic genes, which confirmed the relevance of CCAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, by analysing transcriptomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we have shown that CCAM was effective in both generating and testing hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CCAM showed that among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, high-risk patients had transcriptomes that were more similar to those of both haematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) than low-risk patients, and provided a prognostic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, CCAM reveals hidden relationships between pathological and physiological processes and gene expression, providing meaningful clinical insights into haematological diseases, and these could not be revealed by other univariate and multivariate methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CCAM was effective in identifying candidate genes that are correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotypes</z:mp> of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We expect that CCAM will benefit a wide range of medical fields </plain></SENT>
