<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two patients 6 and 18 years of age, respectively (cases 1 and 2) who had no clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> or risk factors for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis in both cases revealed diffuse nodal effacement by a monotonous population of atypical lymphoid cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei, with very infrequent mitotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells in both cases were of B-cell lineage (CD20 and CD79a positive), with CD43 coexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case showed monoclonal light chain expression, and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cytogenetic findings were detected in case 2, in which metaphase spreads revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 (karyotype 47, XY, +13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 has been described in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, this case represents the first documented association of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 with marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interphase cytogenetics analysis for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3, reported to be associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, was negative in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the MALT type have been reported in HIV-positive patients, the two cases reported here are unique in that they occurred in young patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> or any other evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
