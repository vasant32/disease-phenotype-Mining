<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> AML1 activated the c-mpl promoter through the proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-binding site in luciferase assays using 293T and HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In accord with this result, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AML1 bound to this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we analyzed the function of AML1 using a mutant of AML1 lacking the C terminus (AML1dC), which was originally found in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AML1dC dominant-negatively suppressed transcriptional activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AML1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unexpectedly, AML1dC-transduced murine c-Kit(+)Sca1(+)Lineage(-) cells expressed c-mpl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and c-Mpl protein more abundantly than mock-transduced cells, which led to the enhanced thrombopoietin-mediated proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when AML1dC was induced to express during the development of hematopoietic cells from embryonic stem (ES) cells, AML1dC augmented the c-Mpl expression on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that early hematopoietic cells that derived from AML1(+/-) ES cells expressed c-Mpl more intensely than those that developed from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ES cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AML1dC hardly affected c-Mpl expression and maturation of megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As for the mechanism of the different roles of AML1 in the regulation of the c-mpl promoter, we found that AML1 forms a complex with a transcription repressor mSin3A on the c-mpl promoter in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, although it forms a complex with a transcription activator p300 on the same promoter in megakaryocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate that AML1 can regulate the c-mpl promoter both positively and negatively by changing the binding partner according to cell types </plain></SENT>
