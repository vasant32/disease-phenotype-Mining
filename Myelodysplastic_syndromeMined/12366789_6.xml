<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the new allele following haplotype-specific PCR amplification revealed that exon 2 is identical to HLA-B*4402, whereas exon 3 resembles a HLA-B*40 variant with the exception of position 572, where a single nucleotide transversion (C &gt; G) leads to an amino acid exchange (Trp162Ser) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The generation of the 3' part of B*4431 may be best explained by a separate recombination between B*40 and B*07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although B*4431 consists of B44 in its alpha1 domain and of B60(40) in its alpha2 domain; the new allele only displayed B44 seroreactivity, which demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> crucial for B60(40) specificity must be located in the alpha1 domain </plain></SENT>
