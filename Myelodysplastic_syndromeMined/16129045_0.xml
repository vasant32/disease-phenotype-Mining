<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 1 - 8 micromol/L of As(2)O(3) induced typical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUIZ-1 cells in the dose-and time-dependent manners, the telomerase activity could be down-regulated at this concentration and negatively correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> (r = -0.938, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of telomerase activity was positively related to the expression of hTERT (r = 0.783, P = 0.022), but As(2)O(3) had no effect on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TRF1 and TRF2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of telomerase activity by As(2)O(3) on MUTZ-1 cells was accompanied with the low expression of bcl-2 gene and the decrease of bcl-2/bax ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUTZ-1cells induced by As(2)O(3) may occur via the inhibition of telomerase activity and down-regulation of the expression of hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and this may be one of the mechanisms inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MUTZ-1 cells treated by As(2)O(3) </plain></SENT>
