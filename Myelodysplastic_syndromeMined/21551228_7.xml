<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase 2 study explored the safety and efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in previously untreated older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with del(5q) who declined standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with lenalidomide 50 mg daily for 28 days as induction therapy and 10 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 37 evaluable patients, the median age was 74 years (range, 60-94), 21 (57%) were female, 19 (51%) had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 30 (81%) had pretreatment cytogenetic studies evaluated centrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six had isolated del(5q), 1 had del(5q) and +8, 23 had complex cytogenetics, and 7 others had del(5q) identified locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (38%) completed induction therapy: 7 patients died during induction therapy, 8 had disease progression, 7 had nonfatal adverse events, and 1 entered hospice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients started maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (14%) achieved a partial or complete response, 2 with isolated del(5q) and 3 with complex cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse-free survival was 5 months (range, 0-19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 2 months for the entire population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, lenalidomide as a single agent has modest activity in older del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
