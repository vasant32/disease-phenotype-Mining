<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to improve survival in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective case-control study to compare survival with these treatment modalities in patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were identified using a departmental database and transplant patients were matched in at least three of the following five criteria: year of diagnosis, age, blast percentage, International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic risk, and time from diagnosis to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 26 and 25 months for, respectively, allo-SCT [(n = 53); range, 2-210 months] and HMA [(n = 40); range, 2-98 months] (P = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four-year survival rates were 24 and 23% for allo-SCT patients and the nontransplant cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing allo-SCT after 2000 had longer median OS compared with those transplanted before 2000 (41 versus 7 months, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results would suggest that prospective studies are needed to delineate the timing and efficacy of allo-SCT in the HMA era </plain></SENT>
