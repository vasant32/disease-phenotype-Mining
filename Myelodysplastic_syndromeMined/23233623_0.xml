<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, cytopenias are classified as deficiency mediated, immune mediated, BM failure induced, renal, or idiopathic, with the latter including the so-called idiopathic cytopenias of undetermined significance (ICUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings, symptoms, blood counts, BM findings, and other laboratory parameters are usually sufficient to reveal the type and cause of a marked cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild cytopenia, it may be a challenge for the physician to establish a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such patients, laboratory features and findings often reflect a diagnostic interface, so that criteria that are otherwise robust may hardly be applicable or are not helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even if the BM is examined, the diagnosis often remains uncertain in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than one potential cause of cytopenia may be present, especially in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or another BM disorder, but also an overt autoimmune or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, may develop during follow-up in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A key problem is that in an early phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, most laboratory and clinical signs are "nonspecific." One of the very few reliable peripheral blood parameters distinguishing between an early or "pre-phase" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and most other causes of a mild cytopenia are the numbers of circulating colony-forming progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, flow cytometric and molecular investigations may sometimes assist in the delineation between clonal and reactive conditions underlying mild cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review provides an overview of diagnostic approaches and algorithms for patients with mild unexplained cytopenia(s) </plain></SENT>
