<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 70.4, median interval from diagnosis 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IPSS was low in 31% and intermediate-1 in 69% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Del 5q was isolated, with 1 additional and &gt;1 additional abnormality in 79%, 14%, and 6% patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>62 (65%) patients achieved transfusion independence (TI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant factor predicting TI was baseline platelet count &gt;150 G/L and platelet decrease by at least 50% during the first weeks of treatment (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were seen in 74% and 37.9% of the cases, respectively, and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributed to cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight (8%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet decrease by less than 50% predicted a higher risk of DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 6 patients (6.3%) patients progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but median follow-up time was short (18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We confirm the high rate of TI with Lenalidomide in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Very close patient monitoring for cytopenias and DVT is mandatory, especially during the first weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
