<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the applications of karyotypic analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromosomal analysis was performed with short-term cell cultures and R-banding techniques in 129 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And the technique of FISH was employed for clinical follow-ups in 28 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the result of abnormal karyotype, the patients were divided into three groups: low risk group , intermediate risk and high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation time and survival time between these three groups were compare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among them, 52 patients (40.3%) had numeral karyotypic abnormalities of chromosomes and structural alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex abnormal karyotype was the most common and accounted for 30.8% (16 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of 20q(-) and +8 were 19.2% (10 cases) and 15.4% (8 cases)respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six cases were positive by FISH, however, of whom, were negative for conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up data were available in 88 patients with a median follow up duration of 11(3, 60) months, 27 cases (30.7%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation were 27.8% (15/54), 23.5% (4/17) and 47.1% (8/17) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median durations of leukemic transformation were &gt; 60 (14, &gt; 60), 48 (35, &gt; 60) and 7 (6, 12) months in the low, intermediate and high-risk groups and the median survival times were 26(15, &gt; 60), 21(14, 35) and 10(6, 13) months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median durations of leukemic transformation and median survival periods in the high-risk groups were shorter than those in the low and intermediate risk groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Karyotypic analysis has important values in the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
