<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of 26 patients displayed MSI (8%), one of them at five loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LOH was detected in six out of 26 cases (23%), predominantly involving markers IRF1 [5q31] and WT1 [11p] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients displayed a corresponding chromosomal deletion by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supporting the mutator phenotype hypothesis, a significant coincidence of LOH, MSI and chromosome abnormalities was observed (P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data suggest that LOH represents an initial rather than a secondary genetic event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, promoting genetic instability in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
