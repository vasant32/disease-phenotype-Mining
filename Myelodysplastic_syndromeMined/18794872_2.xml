<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience of performing 40 such transplants from July 2004 to November 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Source of stem cells was peripheral blood in 33, bone marrow in six and combined in one </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 19 years (range 2.2-46) with 29 male and 11 female participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis was administered along with conditioning, and at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, systemic antibiotics were started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antifungal agents were added if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> persisted for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median time for neutrophil engraftment was 10 days (range 8-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> occurred in 38 (95%) for a median of 5 days (range 1-38), and blood cultures were positive in seven (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systemic antibiotics were used in 95% and antifungals in 57.5% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was nil, and 100-day mortality was 1 (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After day 100, there were eight fatalities (20%) due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD-3, relapse-2, graft rejection-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152915" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated tuberculosis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that allogeneic HSCT can be safely performed in non-HEPA filter rooms in India </plain></SENT>
