<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5 patients had stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 78-92 g/l, and 7 were transfusion-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients, r-epo was given intravenously three times a week, with dose escalation after 4 and 8 wk if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> did not increase more than 15 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The doses were 600, 1500 and 3000 U/kg bodyweight/wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 12th patient was treated subcutaneously with a dose of 560 U/kg/wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 patients showed a significant response with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of greater than or equal to 15 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2 of these had stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> before treatment and increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> from 87 to 116 g/l and from 80 to 99 g/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3rd patient was transfusion-dependent and rose to a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level between 76 and 80 g/l without transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 patients showed a reduction of their transfusion need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean initial serum erythropoietin in the responding group was 366 U/l compared to 1049 among the non-responders (p = 0.367) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Response was observed in 5/7 patients without bone marrow sideroblasts and in 0/5 patients with sideroblasts (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin seems to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for a certain proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A larger patient material might provide a model for predicting responses </plain></SENT>
