<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the correlation between FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and poor prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), we conducted a phase 1 trial of tandutinib in 40 patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tandutinib was given orally in doses ranging from 50 mg to 700 mg twice daily The principal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of tandutinib was reversible generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscular weakness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, or both, occurring at doses of 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tandutinib's pharmacokinetics were characterized by slow elimination, with achievement of steady-state plasma concentrations requiring greater than 1 week of dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed that tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 in circulating leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had FLT3-ITD mutations; 5 of these were evaluable for assessment of tandutinib's antileukemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the 5 patients, treated at 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily, showed evidence of antileukemic activity, with decreases in both peripheral and bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tandutinib at the MTD (525 mg twice daily) should be evaluated more extensively in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with FLT3-ITD mutations to better define its antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
