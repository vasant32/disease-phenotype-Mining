<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel metrics for non-disease variables are urgently needed to help define the best treatment for each older patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the feasibility and prognostic value of geriatric/quality of life assessments aside from established disease-specific variables in 195 patients aged 60 years or over with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were grouped according to treatment intensity and assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment consisted of eight instruments evaluating activities of daily living, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, mental functioning, mobility, comorbidities, Karnofsky Index and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a median age of 71 years (range 60-87 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n=63) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n=132) were treated either with best supportive care (n=47), hypomethylating agents (n=73) or intensive chemotherapy/hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After selection of variables, pathological activities of daily living and quality of life/<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> remained highly predictive for overall survival in the entire patient group beyond disease-related risk factors adverse cytogenetics and blast count of 20% or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 107 patients treated non-intensively activities of daily living of less than 100 (hazard ratio, HR 2.94), Karnofsky Index below 80 (HR 2.34) and quality of life/'<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>' of 50 or over (HR 1.77) were significant prognosticators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Summation of adverse features revealed a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR 9.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-depth evaluation of older patients prior to individual treatment allocation is feasible and provides additional information to standard assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 60 years or over with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and impairments in activities of daily living, Karnofsky Index below 80%, quality of life/'<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>' of 50 or over, are likely to have poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
