<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study prospectively analysed the relationships between immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features of blast cells in 432 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (ANLL) at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An abnormal karyotype was detected in 232 cases (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were related to immunophenotypic markers as detected using a consensual panel of monoclonal antibodies allowing lineage assignment and investigation of myeloid marker expression on blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, CD9, CD10, CD15, CD34 and TdT expression appeared significantly associated with chromosomal anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified CD34 and CD9 expression as independently predictive of the presence of at least one cytogenetic abnormality (P &lt; 10(-4) and P &lt; 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant associations between immunophenotypic and karyotypic features were observed both within individual FAB subgroups and independently from morphological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific features were seen in five ANLL entities: M0 or M1/B lineage antigen positivity/t(9;22) or del(11)(q23); M2/CD13-/t(8;21); M4/CD13+, CD34+, CD36+/inv(16); M4 or M5/lack of B lineage antigen/del(11)(q23) or t(9;11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More practically, and although the relationships demonstrated only represent a fraction of homogeneous immunophenotypic subgroups, identification of such immunophenotypic features should prompt careful karyotypic examination, eventually using molecular biology analysis on non-growing cells </plain></SENT>
