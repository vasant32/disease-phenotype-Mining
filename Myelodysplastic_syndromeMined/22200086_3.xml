<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only approximately 50% of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients show clonal cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether high-resolution microarray analysis would reveal new or additional aberrations, we analyzed 35 samples derived from patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray with targeted coverage of approximately 1900 genes associated with hematologic and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs) were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples (range 1-31, median 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 28 of 35 samples (80%), aCGH revealed new cytogenetic aberrations not seen by karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 132 cryptic aberrations (â‰¤5 Mb) were identified in 25 cases (71.4%) including deletions of NF1, RUNX1, RASSF1, CCND1, TET2, DNMT3A, HRAS, PDGFRA and FIP1L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, aCGH clarified known complex aberrations in 17 of 35 samples (48.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results using whole-genome arrays with higher density coverage targeted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> features demonstrate the usefulness of arrays to identify rare and cryptic recurring imbalances that may prove to be significant in disease progression or transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and may improve the suitability or efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
