<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now searched in the same cohort of patients for differences between patients who responded to treatment and remained free of complications and those who relapsed or developed a clonal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 107 patients surviving for more than 1 year after immunosuppression, 34 remained free from complications after the first course of ALG, and 73 presented an event defined as relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, development of a clonal complication such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, or appearance of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared these two groups for survival, clinical performance and blood counts during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival probability was 93% for the event-free patients, and 55% for the patients with a complication event (p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free patients had a higher incidence of complete remission (71%), were more often free of immunosuppressive treatment (79%) and independent of transfusions (100%), and had a higher Karnofsky score (91% with a score &gt; or =90%) as compared to the group with events (29, 37, 67, 48%; p &lt; or = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 3 years, event-free patients had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, as compared to patients with a complication (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, at 3 and 5 years, event-free patients had borderline higher platelet counts (p = 0.056, p = 0.078) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>097, p = 0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation as an expression of the variability of the results in each group was systematically lower at 3, 5 and 10 years in the group of event-free patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite some differences between the two groups, our data support the hypothesis that patients with long-lasting remissions should not be considered as definitively cured of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
