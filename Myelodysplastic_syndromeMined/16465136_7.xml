<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency rate of visceral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 27.9% (435/1,557) in 1989, 23.0% (319/1,388) in 1993, 22.3% (246/1,105) in 1997 and 25.1% (260/ 1,037) in 2001, which was clearly higher than the rate of cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 3.4%, 2.7%, 3.5% and 3.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in comparing the rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> in recipients of stem cell transplantation with that of non-recipients, that of recipients was about 10% higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus, at approximately the same rate (Candida 33.6%, Aspergillus 33.3%) as in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Aspergillus increased conspicuously in 1993 (Candida 22.3% Aspergillus 44.5%), and continued to increase (Candida 22.8%, Aspergillus 50.8% in 1997; Candida 16.9%, Aspergillus 54.2% in 2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">zygomycosis</z:e>, the lung and bronchi comprised the most commonly infected organs: 74.7% and 75.6% of the total cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 1,260 cases with mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in the four years studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> were the major diseases (35.5% and 33.5%, respectively) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (29.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given these facts, we emphasize that a greater interest in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> should be taken by clinicians, and immunocompromised patients should be protected from opportunistic invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
