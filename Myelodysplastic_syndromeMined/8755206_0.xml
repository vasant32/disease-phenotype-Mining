<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study describes a molecular method of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the rearrangement PML/RAR alpha in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> promyelocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (APL) in order to assess its specificity and sensibility, and to evaluate its utility in the characterization of APL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January and June of 1995, 64 samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) cytapheresis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 58 APL samples (23 patients: 10 samples obtained with disease activity, 43 samples in complete remission (CR) and 5 PBSC samples) and 6 control samples, of non-APL <z:hpo ids='HP_0004377'>hematological neoplasms</z:hpo> (3 other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 1 ALL, and 1 MDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> obtained from the isolated mononuclear cells of each sample a conserved region of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was amplified by using a RT-PCR with specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity assays were performed by diluting PML/RAR alpha positive <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples into <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RT-PCR assay was capable to detect the PML/RAR alpha until an 1/1000 dilution in negative control <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 58 APL samples failed in the amplification of the control gene, and were considered non-evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 6 control samples showed PML/RAR alpha rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 10 APL samples with disease activity were positive for the presence of PML/RAR alpha (the non-positive sample was a non-evaluable one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six out of 43 APL samples in CR showed the rearrangement, 3 of them corresponding to 2 patients who posteriory relapsed 12 and 19 months after 1st CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other 3 positive samples came from other 3 APL patients (24 months in 3rd CR, 14 months in 1st CR and early CR), who remained in CR at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No relapse could be noted in patients with negative PCR samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PML/RAR alpha was not found in any of the 5 APL PBSC samples studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The RT-PCR method described here seems to be highly specific as it only detects this rearrangement in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of PML/RAR alpha in CR patients could be related to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these reasons, this molecular method shows great usefulness and can be advocated, not only for assessing diagnosis, but for as monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in the post remission follow up </plain></SENT>
