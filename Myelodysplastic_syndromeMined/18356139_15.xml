<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess prognostic factors and outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) who received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 195 patients who received ASCT between 1985 and June 2005 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median time from first treatment to ASCT was 2.6 years (0.4-27.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demography at ASCT was 61% stage IV, median age 31 years (18-69), median prior treatment (tx) regimens 3 (2-7), median Hasenclever index 3 (0-6); 150 patients had responding disease [54 complete remission (CR), 96 partial remission (PR)], and 45 patients had untested relapse/refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Post-ASCT, 61% (119/195) patients attained CR with an overall response (CR + PR) of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had nonrelapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 119 patients attaining CR, 27 relapsed: 3 after attaining CR for &gt;5 years and 1 after attaining CR for &gt;10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS)/progression-free survival (PFS) from ASCT was 9 years/2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year OS/PFS was 55% of 44% and 10-year OS/PFS was 49.4% of 37% for whole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty (10%) patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> (seven secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Probability of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> at 10 years was 14.7% (95% confidence interval 8.9% to 23.8%) and 24.8% at 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide the longest follow-up reported for patients receiving ASCT for relapsed/refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition to previously described prognostic factors, our data show that Hasenclever index &lt;3 influences outcome favorably and attaining CR at ASCT leads to a better outcome </plain></SENT>
