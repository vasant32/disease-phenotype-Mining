<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of exploring the molecular events underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using cDNA microarray and mixing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from multiple patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A commercially purchased BioStar H141 cDNA microarray containing 14,110 clones of cDNA or EST was employed to analyze the gene expression profile of bone marrow mononuclear cells from two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Equal amount of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from each patient was mixed, reversely transcribed to cDNA and labeled with Cy5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixture of Cy5-labeled cDNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi>-labeled cDNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells was concomitantly hybridized to H141 microarray in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In H141 chips, 1,064 cDNAs were spotted at least twice targeting different fragments of a single gene cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that among these 1,064 cDNA clones, the expression level of 625 (58.7%) and 630 (59.2%) ones was consistent within these two chips, respectively, 297 (27.9%) and 191 (18.0%) inconsistent, 21 (2.0%) and 11 (1.0%) in opposite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 411 duplicately spotted cDNAs with complete data, expression levels of 400 (97.3%) was consistent between two chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>488 genes with known function were identified as differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, among which 101 genes were involved in hematopoiesis regulation, including those encoding transcription factors, cell cycle-regulating proteins, metabolism-relating enzymes, and adhesive molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that cDNA microarray can be used for profiling gene expression of mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples and replication shall be necessary for reducing the data bias caused by experimental operation </plain></SENT>
