<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Serum levels of cytokines related to the metabolism of bone tissue [osteocalcin and parathyroid hormone (PTH)], adipose tissue (adiponectin, leptin and ghrelin) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] were determined in 72 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, mostly of the low-risk group according to FAB classification, and 41 healthy individuals (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: Adiponectin and osteocalcin serum levels were significantly elevated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leptin, insulin and IGF-1 serum levels were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the serum levels of PTH and ghrelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin levels were reversibly associated with patient blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Increased serum levels of adiponectin and low levels of IGF-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may counterbalance the increased rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the pool of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Osteocalcin secreted by osteoblasts regulates the renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hormones and cytokines either secreted by the cells of the bone marrow stroma or transferred by the microcirculation act on hematopoietic progenitors and may regulate their differentiation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
