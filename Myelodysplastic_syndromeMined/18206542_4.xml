<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are only a limited number of publications on the development of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> during follow-up of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although drugs targeting at DNA-topoisomerase II characteristically induce translocations involving 11q23, this was seldom seen in patients treated for APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a patient initially diagnosed with APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy was monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the PML-RARalpha rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consecutive samples showed a swift and complete reduction of PML-RARalpha rearranged cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty months after diagnosis, however, conventional cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype with a translocation involving 11q23 and loss of chromosomes 7q and Xq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis with the MLL probe identified 2q37 (harboring the SEPT2 gene) as the translocation partner of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider the rather unique t(2;11)(q37;q23) as the primary event causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case stresses the importance of conventional karyotyping to be performed on a regular basis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated APL patients for the early detection of chromosomal aberrations that indicate the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
