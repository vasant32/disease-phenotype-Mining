<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A report of a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> which might be related to abnormal immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and laboratory features of 29 patients with positive bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) Coombs tests were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of these cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or decreased bone marrow cellularities and increased normoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found to have negative results of conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> tests and hematopoietic nutrient determination and had no evidence of malignant clonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed positive BMMNC-Coombs test and good response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immunorelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> might be caused by abnormal immunity (especially autoantibody) mediated destruction or abnormal function of blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is beneficial to differentiate immunorelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
