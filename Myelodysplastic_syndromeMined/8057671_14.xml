<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> p53 protein has a short half-life and cannot be detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutated p53, on the other hand, has a prolonged half-life and becomes detectable by this method, so that its detection by immunohistochemistry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> is almost synonymous with mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the value of immunocytochemical analysis of p53 protein on blood or bone marrow slides in the detection of p53 mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, by comparison with single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) were studied by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry showed detectable levels of intracellular p53 in 19 cases (including 2/19 AML, 2/21 ALL, 11/48 MDS, 4/40 CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining by p53 antibodies was restricted to the nucleus of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and of lymphocytes in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 16 of the 19 cases, SSCP analysis, followed by direct sequencing, showed a p53 missense mutation in exons 4 to 8 of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three cases, where the number of cells stained by p53 antibodies was small, no p53 mutation could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, SSCP and sequence analysis identified a p53 mutation in two patients who had negative immunocytochemical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both cases had a nonsense mutation, presumably leading to reduced levels of truncated p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, overall, immunocytochemistry and SSCP gave concordant results in 123 of the 128 (96%) patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that immunocytochemistry on blood and bone marrow smears is a sensitive method of p53 mutation detection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, except in the rare patients with chain-terminating mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive immunocytochemistry is found in some patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SSCP findings, and could correspond to overexpression of a non-mutated p53, but also to p53 mutation in a minor proportion of the malignant cells, undetectable by SSCP </plain></SENT>
