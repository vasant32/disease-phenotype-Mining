<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow samples from 56 consecutive newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were characterized by the FCSS and compared with findings in 27 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cytopenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FCSS scores were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than those in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A flow score of 2 or more allowed for a specificity of 100% with 75% sensitivity in distinguishing these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FCSS scores correlated directly with validated prognostic systems including WHO classification, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), WHO-adjusted prognostic scoring system (WPSS) and transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival of conventionally treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was directly related to FCSS group; severe: 6 months; moderate: 19 months and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/mild: not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analyses suggested the FCSS risk categories were an independent prognostic factor after adjustment for sex, age (above or below 70 years), IPSS or WPSS risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that quantifying aberrancies in the myelomonocytic lineage by FCSS is useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis and extends the prognostic utility for conventionally treated/untreated patients, especially among patients classified within the refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) subgroup </plain></SENT>
