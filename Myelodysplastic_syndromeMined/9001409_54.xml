<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment options of low-dose Ara-C and haematopoietic growth factors are disappointing in regard to response rate or response duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the treatment with a 72-h continuous infusion of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (DAC) in a group of 29 elderly patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients (54%) we observed a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight complete responses were reached, even among patients with bad prognostic cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial median survival from the start of the therapy was 46 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only (and major) toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, leading to a prolonged cytopenic period and thus leading to five toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (17%) in this high-risk patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DAC is an effective drug in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and that it probably works via its cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myelotoxicity is its major adverse effect </plain></SENT>
