<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were retrospectively evaluated with a direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antibody screening, serum electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory studies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, reticulocyte count, DHL, total and indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>) were done simultaneously, as well as the French-American-British subtype and bone marrow biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alloantibodies were demonstrated in 17 patients (58.6%), autoantibodies in 10 (34.4%) patients and cold agglutinin in 18 (62%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAT was mediated by only IgG in 8 patients (80%), by IgG and C3 in 1 patient (10%) and by IgG, IgA and C3 in 1 (10%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disease</z:e> occurred in patients with autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>Increased serum gammaglobulin</z:hpo> was observed in 16 (54.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the incidence of allo-/autoantibodies and the gammaglobulin level (p = 0.937) and the presence of lymphocyte infiltrates in bone marrow biopsies (p = 0.156) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed when the incidence of autoantibodies and number of red blood cell transfusions were compared (p = 0.334) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> subtypes had a higher incidence of allo-/autoantibodies than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> have a high incidence of allo- and autoantibodies, probably related to intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorder</z:e>, without clinical or laboratory <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
