<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our search for this gene, we identified a candidate, 5qNCA (LOC51780), which lies within a consistently-deleted segment of 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5qNCA expresses a 7.2-kb transcript with a 5286-bp open reading frame which is present at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and liver as well as CD34+ cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5qNCA encodes a 191-kD nuclear protein which contains a highly-conserved C-terminus containing a zinc finger with the unique spacing Cys-X2-Cys-X7-His-X2-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys and a jmjC domain, which is often found in proteins that regulate chromatin remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of 5qNCA in a del(5q) cell line results in suppression of clonogenic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary sequence results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples and cell lines has revealed a possible mutation in the KG-1 cell line resulting in a THR to ALA substitution that has not been found in over 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose 5qNCA is a good candidate for the del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene based on its predicted function and growth suppressive activities, and suggest that further mutational and functional study of this interesting gene is warranted </plain></SENT>
