<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) and a history of pregnancy were randomized to receive either standard random single-donor platelet transfusions (mean leukocytes, 430 x 10(6) per transfusion) or leukocyte-depleted random single-donor platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> to less than 5 x 10(6) leukocytes per platelet transfusion (mean leukocytes, 2 x 10(6) per transfusion) was achieved by filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 62 evaluable patients, refractoriness to random donor platelets occurred in 41% (14 of 34) of the patients in the standard group and in 29% (8 of 28) of the patients in the filtered group (P = .52); anti-HLA antibodies developed in 43% (9 of 21) of individuals in the standard group and 44% (11 of 25) of cases in the filtered group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time toward refractoriness and development of anti-HLA antibodies was similar for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of random single-donor platelet products to less than 5 x 10(6) per transfusion does not reduce the incidence of refractoriness to random donor platelet transfusion because of boostering of anti-HLA antibodies </plain></SENT>
