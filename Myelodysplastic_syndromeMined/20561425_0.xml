<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum TPO and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase in 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 40 patients with AL were measured by using sandwich ELISA and velocity methods before chemotherapy, at the stages of bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and bone marrow recovery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum TPO and LDH in 15 healthy controls were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the serum TPO and LDH levels in ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before chemotherapy were significantly higher than those in healthy controls, the differences were statistically significant (q = 7.2943 - 27.4149, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum TPO and LDH levels in the patients at the stages of bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or bone marrow recovery were significantly lower than those in patients before treatment (q = 7.2943 - 25.9396, p &lt; 0.001), but there were no significant differences as compared with healthy controls (q = 1.4816 - 2.5657, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that there is a strong correlation between serum TPO, LDH levels and the status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, suggesting that TPO and LDH levels can be used for evaluation of therapeutic effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
