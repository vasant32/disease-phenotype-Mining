<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several recombinant cytokines are already applied to clinical field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this symposium, I introduced clinical application of some cytokines including GM-CSF, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical benefits of IL-1 are; 1) IL-1 has an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect especially on cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, and 2) IL-1 has a function as hematopoietic growth factor for very immature hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clinical Phase I/II study, IL-1 has been shown to have anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect on cutaneous T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> via immune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The side effects of IL-1 were variable including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, skin redness and so on, but they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical phase studies of GM-CSF and IL-3 are now on going </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preliminary studies show that GM-CSF has granulo-poietic activity but not thrombo-poietic activity, and that IL-3 has multi-hematopoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cytokines may be useful for treatment of disorders of hematopoietic stem cells such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The side effects of both cytokines are resemble, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are tolerable </plain></SENT>
