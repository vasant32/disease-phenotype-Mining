<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine its efficacy and safety in pediatric patients in a university general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective, longitudinal observational study of pediatric patients on treatment with romiplostim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal efficacy variable was platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety was evaluated by recording possible adverse reactions to the medication, monitoring the appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> during dose reduction, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients in the authors' center have been treated with romiplostim (subcutaneous [SC], initial dose: 1 μg/kg/week) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> refractory to various treatments: 1 with newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 27 to 39 weeks after starting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses were achieved in 7 to 28 days, and complete responses were maintained for 37% to 91% of the follow-up period, with median platelet counts between 40 × 10(3)/μL and 215 × 10(3)/μL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adverse reactions observed during follow-up were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and asthenia in one patient and mucocutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after dose suspension in another one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With regard to effectiveness, the response in the 3 patients was varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The drug was considered to be safe, as there were only mild adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although further studies and long-term follow-up are required, these results show that romiplostim could be considered an alternative to immunosuppressive therapies, such as rituximab, or splenectomy in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
