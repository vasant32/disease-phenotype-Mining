<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the incidence and the pattern of chromosomal changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> varies by location in Korea, we reviewed the cytogenetic results of 205 MDS cases from three medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes and the incidence of chromosomal aberration (44.8%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Korea were similar to those found in other countries, however, their patterns were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations (40.4%) predominated over partial or total deletions (36.3%) in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q, -5/5q-, and -7/7q-, which occurred in 18(19.5%), 14(15.2%), 12(13.0%), and 11(11.9%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is of note that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q, which is rarely reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, was the second most common change associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Korea, and that structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anomalies of chromosomes</z:e> 1(19.6%) exceeded that of chromosome 5(15.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common sole anomalies were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8(7.6%) and 14(78%) of 18 cases with chromosome 1 anomalies accompanied by other chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that the changes of chromosome 1 may be evolutionary events rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 predominate in Korean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, suggesting the likelihood of ethnic differences </plain></SENT>
