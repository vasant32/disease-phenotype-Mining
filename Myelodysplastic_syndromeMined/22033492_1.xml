<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the molecular effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or the functional mechanisms linked with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> effect on PI-PLCbeta1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we further investigated the role of epigenetic regulation of PI-PLCbeta1, mainly focusing on the structure of the PI-PLCbeta1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> on PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation and gene expression in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we studied the expression of key molecules associated with the nuclear inositide signaling pathways, such as cyclin D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By applying a chromatin immunoprecipitation method, we also studied the correlation between the demethylating effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and the degree of recruitment to PI-PLCbeta1 promoter of some transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CpG-binding domain proteins, which specifically interact with methylated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results hint at a specific involvement of PI-PLCbeta1 in epigenetic mechanisms, and are particularly consistent with the hypothesis of a role for PI-PLCbeta1 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>-induced myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
