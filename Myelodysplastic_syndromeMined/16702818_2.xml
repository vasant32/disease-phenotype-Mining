<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in saliva of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> who received high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> at a dose of 3 g/m was administered i.v. over 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saliva samples were collected before initiating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> infusion, within 15 min after the completion of infusion and 2 or 4 h after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> was measured by HPLC methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine patients showed a detectable level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in saliva within 15 min after the completion of infusion (0.58+/-0.48 microg/ml), which was equivalent to 5% of its plasma concentration; however, the drug was no longer detectable in saliva thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is excreted in saliva during and shortly after its administration at a high dose </plain></SENT>
