<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study efficacy and safety of re-treatment with I-131 tositumomab in patients with low-grade, follicular, or transformed low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who relapsed following a response to I-131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prior response &gt; or = 3 months to I-131 tositumomab was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The single therapeutic dose following a dosimetric dose was adjusted to give the same total body dose (in Gy) as that used for the original dose, or was attenuated if the platelet count was less than 150,000 per mm(3) or if the prior treatment resulted in grade 4 cytopenias lasting longer than 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 32 patients enrolled, 28 completed the therapeutic dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A median of four therapies were given before re-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (56%) of 32 patients had a complete or partial response (median duration, 15.2 months); eight (25%) had a complete response (median duration, 35 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five continue in response from 1.8 to 5.7 years, with a median follow-up of 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall median response duration was not significantly different for the two treatments, with no clinical factors predicting response or its duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of 18 re-responders had longer responses with re-treatment, with five having responses &gt; or = 1.5 years longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 50% and 43% of patients, respectively, similar to initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antimouse antibodies developed in 10% of patients, and 12% developed elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e>, including four patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (one who had not received the therapeutic dose) and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Re-treatment with I-131 tositumomab following a previous response can produce second responses that can be durable </plain></SENT>
