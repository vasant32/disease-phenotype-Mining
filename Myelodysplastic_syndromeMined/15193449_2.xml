<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> are capable of inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This risk of both diseases in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> has been estimated to be 10-20% after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the time course and the type of genetic abnormalities in melphalan-treated patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization methods with probes to 5q31 and 7q31 to mononuclear peripheral blood leukocytes of 18 melphalan-treated patients and compared the results to those of 8 untreated <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found three patients (17%) with a 5q31 deletion in their peripheral white blood cells, but no 7q31 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that 5q- occurs before the overt development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and raise important concerns regarding long-term treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the performance of cytogenetic evaluation should be considered before autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biological implications of these findings should be evaluated in larger clinical and laboratory studies </plain></SENT>
