<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused our study on the cytokine TRAIL (TNF-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand), which has been shown to exhibit an anti-differentiation activity on erythroid maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) showed an increased expression of TRAIL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TRAIL expression was increased predominantly in myeloid precursors of granulocytic lineage and in a subset of monocytes and pro-erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant levels of soluble TRAIL were released in 21 of 68 BMMC culture supernatants from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TRAIL was detected less frequently in the culture supernatants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (4 of 33) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMMC (0 of 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of peripheral blood parameters revealed significantly lower levels of peripheral red blood cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in the subset of patients whose BMMC released TRAIL in culture supernatants compared to the subgroup of patients who did not release TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TRAIL-positive BMMC culture supernatants inhibited the differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycophorin A+ erythroblasts generated in serum-free liquid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased expression and release of TRAIL at the bone marrow level is likely to impair erythropoiesis and to contribute to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the major clinical feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
