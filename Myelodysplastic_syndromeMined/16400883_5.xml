<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta protein, and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the progression of the disease was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared with healthy control subjects (n = 74), patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 55) showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were no differences in the distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (mild group) and those with bi- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (severe group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand the TT homozygosity at codon 10 in exon 1 of TGF-beta1 gene was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia [95% CI OR = 4.889, p = 0.0071] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the investigated genetic polymorphisms do not predispose to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but that TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism may affect the disease progression </plain></SENT>
