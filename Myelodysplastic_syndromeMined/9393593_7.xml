<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on neutrophils in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have indicated deficiencies in the contents of primary and secondary granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the granule membrane remains virtually unstudied despite its essential role in the dynamic function of the cytoplasmic granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> of primary and secondary granules of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow neutrophils using the monoclonal antibody H36/71 to CD15 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, myeloperoxidase activity and antigen, elastase and lactoferrin were also studied using cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 216 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies of granule membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> were the most common, detected in 49%, followed by myeloperoxidase activity (17%), elastase (16%), myeloperoxidase antigen (9%), and lactoferrin (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple deficiencies always included granule membrane deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that granule membrane defects are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, may provide a common mechanism for multiple granule deficiencies, and may prove to be an additional abnormality associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002462'>granulocyte dysfunction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
