<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was observed for 11 years and presented a clinical picture suggestive of pure white cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> for seven years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hairy cells (HC) were first discovered in the bone marrow, then occasionally in the blood during the last four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A brief course of low-dose alpha interferon promptly induced prolonged remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, this case, as few others described till now, should be considered a rare HCL variant, an understanding of which offers an important clinical opportunity for investigating the myeloid inhibitory activity of hairy cells </plain></SENT>
