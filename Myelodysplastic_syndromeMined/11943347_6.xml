<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These sites are divided into two classes: common and rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Common fragile sites are expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals at different frequencies, whereas rare ones are found only in certain individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common and rare fragile sites have been shown to display a number of characteristics of instability being preferential sites for chromosomal deletions, duplications, and rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a majority of mapped oncogenes are located at or near these fragile sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations have led to the suggestion that both classes of fragile sites may play a significant role in chromosomal rearrangements involved in oncogene activation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> supressor gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, involvement of common and rare fragile sites and their relevance to specific chromosome breakpoints in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have received much attention </plain></SENT>
