<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained smoking history by interview of 330 cytogenetically investigated adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases and 337 controls, matched with respect to sex, year of birth, and county of living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smoking for at least 1 year at some time 20 years or less before diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative risk (RR) for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated a relation with intensity and duration of smoking as well as a decrease in risk a few years after cessation of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smoking was associated with an increased RR for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with chromosome 7 abnormalities (OR 5.0; 95% CI = 1.1-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated RRs were also seen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (OR 2.5; 95% CI = 1.2-5.6) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (OR 3.2; 95% CI = 0.88-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that smoking is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
