<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate simultaneously the megakaryocytopoiesis and apoptotic characteristics in bone marrow in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we used CD41 immunoenzyme (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase) and DNA in situ end-labeling techniques on plastic embedded bone marrow biopsy sections of 29 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that CD41-positive cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow numbered 26.2 +/- 18.2/mm2 (mean +/- standard deviation) compared with 15.6 +/- 7.1/mm2 in controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numbers of cells with the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of micro-megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow were significantly higher than in controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow were frequently distributed along trabeculae (in 27 cases) and formed clusters (in 25 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow accounted for just 4.4 and 9.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD41-positive cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> apoptotic cells, respectively (P &gt; 0.05 compared with controls), but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred only in micro-megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we conclude that megakaryocytosis and dysmegakaryocytosis are the features of dyshematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased thrombocyte production and thrombocyte release coming from increased dys(micro)megakaryocytes and abnormally located megakaryocytes perhaps play a more important role in peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> than megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of micro-megakaryocytes may be a protective biological mechanism to remove useless megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
