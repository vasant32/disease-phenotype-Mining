<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who are predicted to have lower-risk disease as defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) demonstrate more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> and shorter overall survival than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of patients with greater-than-predicted prognostic risk could influence the selection of therapy and improve the care of patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an independent validation of the MD Anderson Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) in a cohort of 288 patients with low- or intermediate-1 IPSS risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and examined bone marrow samples from these patients for mutations in 22 genes, including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and DNMT3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> successfully stratified patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into three risk categories with significant differences in overall survival (20% in category 1 with median of 5.19 years [95% CI, 3.01 to 10.34 years], 56% in category 2 with median of 2.65 years [95% CI, 2.18 to 3.30 years], and 25% in category 3 with median of 1.11 years [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.51 years]), thus validating this prognostic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were identified in 71% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, and mutations associated with a poor prognosis were enriched in the highest-risk LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations of EZH2, RUNX1, TP53, and ASXL1 were associated with shorter overall survival independent of the LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only EZH2 mutations retained prognostic significance in a multivariable model that included LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> and other mutations (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.85 to 4.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combining the LR-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> and EZH2 mutation status identifies 29% of patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a worse-than-expected prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients may benefit from earlier initiation of disease-modifying therapy </plain></SENT>
