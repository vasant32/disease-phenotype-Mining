<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand this phenomenon, a 2-color flow cytometric method was developed to determine quantitative and qualitative alterations of A, B, and H antigens in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristic patterns, dependent on the genotype, were seen for healthy individuals from each of the blood groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent (16/29) of patients of blood group A, B, or AB had a proportion of red cells with decreased expression of A or B antigens compared with no changes in 127 healthy A, B, and AB individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the changes were not detected by routine serologic typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of A or B antigens was the primary change in 28% (8/29) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17% (5/29) of patients, loss of A or B antigens was an indirect consequence of loss of the precursor H antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations involving both the H and the A or B antigens were seen in 10% (3/29) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of H was also detected in 21% (6/28) of group O patients whereas none of 51 healthy O individuals showed changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alterations of ABO antigens can now be considered a common event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
