<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: OS rates were retrospectively analyzed in 41 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 26 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; their median age was 61 years (range 15 to 77 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (50.7%) patients received standard induction courses; 19 (28.4%) patients had low-intensity therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restraining therapy was used to treat 14 (20.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of follow-up was 1.5 to 171 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irrespective of the type of disease, the median OS was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A difference in OS was found when the patients were divided into 4 age groups: those who were under 40 years of age (n = 11 ), 41-60 years (n = 21), 61-69 years (n = 21), and &gt; or = 70 years (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With age, the median OS decreased from 9.5 to 4 months (p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the intensity of induction courses was the cause that affected OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High comorbidity index and, first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> were the main reason for discontinuing standard chemotherapy courses in patients aged 70 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Standard induction courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> therapy are not indicated for patients aged &gt; or = 70 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and extended stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with complex karyotype and high comorbidity index </plain></SENT>
