<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior studies, mostly comprised of small sample sizes, have reported conflicting results while evaluating the usefulness of FISH in addition to G-band karyotyping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the utility of performing a tailored FISH panel, in addition to G-band karyotyping was evaluated in a series of 110 MDS patients diagnosed at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using our FISH panel, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 3/8 (38%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with karyotype failure and in 5/54 (9%) cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G-band karyotypes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the latter had intermediate or high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the cases with abnormal G-band karyotypes, 6/48 (13%) showed discrepancies between FISH and G-band results, however, FISH analysis only lead to reassignment of karyotypic abnormalities to different chromosomes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cytogenetic risk stratification was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that FISH testing is informative only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with karyotype failure and intermediate-high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G-band karyotype and has limited utility in cases that have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G-band karyotypes and morphologic features of low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or in cases with abnormal G-band karyotypes </plain></SENT>
