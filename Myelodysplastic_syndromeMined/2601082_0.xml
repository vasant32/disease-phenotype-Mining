<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several abnormalities were observed in eosinophils in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings under light microscope frequently revealed granular abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and nuclear abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, eosinophils were barely detectable in the peripheral blood cells and immature eosinophils increased in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> showed crystalloid abnormalities in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and an increase of eosinophils lacking crystalloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward larger-sized granules in cases of M2 and smaller-sized granules in cases of M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We think that these eosinophils tumorous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to accumulate date on more cases, but it seems that, to some extent, there are uniform abnormalities associated with each of the different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
