<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with haptoglobin deficiency associated with haptoglobin IgG antibodies, who experienced severe nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (NHTRs), have been identified in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haptoglobin deficiency therefore might be a risk factor for NHTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 4138 cases of voluntarily reported NHTRs in Japan, including 367 cases of immediate-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> anaphylactic NHTRs, were examined to identify haptoglobin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum haptoglobin IgG and IgE antibodies were determined in haptoglobin-deficient patients to elucidate the mechanism underlying the transfusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients with haptoglobin deficiency were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of them experienced severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NHTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of them were identified to be homozygous for the Hpdel allele of the haptoglobin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both haptoglobin IgG and IgE antibodies were detected in serum samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stimulative effects of blood transfusion on the production of hap- toglobin antibodies in the patients and the relation- ship between the presence of the antibodies and the occurrence of the transfusion reactions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anaphylactic NHTRs in these patients with haptoglobin deficiency associated with serum haptoglobin antibodies were suggested to be prevalent in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to IgG antibodies, IgE haptoglobin antibodies detected in the sera of such patients were suggested to play a role in the occurrence of the reactions </plain></SENT>
