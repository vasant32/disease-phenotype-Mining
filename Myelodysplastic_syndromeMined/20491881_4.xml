<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide elicits high response rates and morphological improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with chromosome 5q deletion [del(5q)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further evaluate the role of RPS14, its transcription was tested in bone marrow cells from 17 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System defined Low- or Intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q) as a single or additional cytogenetic abnormality receiving treatment with lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 wk of lenalidomide treatment, erythroid responses were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of 2.7 +/- 2.5 g/dL (up to a mean 11.8 +/- 1.9 g/dL; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, RPS14 expression levels were under-expressed in 15 patients with respect to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 12 wk of lenalidomide treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had an erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in median RPS14 expression from baseline 0.01 (IQR 0.05-0.31) to 12 wk 204.71-fold (2.86-446.32; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations in the patient setting support the importance of RPS14 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
