<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We postulated that fludarabine (Flu) instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) combined with i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu) as preconditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) would improve safety and retain antileukemic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients received BuCy2, and subsequently, 148 patients received Bu-Flu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a Bayesian method to compare outcomes between these nonrandomized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups had comparable pretreatment characteristics, except that Bu-Flu patients were older (46 versus 39 years, P &lt; .01), more often had unrelated donors (47.3% versus 20.9%, P &lt; .0003), and had shorter median follow-up (39.7 versus 74.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To account for improved supportive care and other unidentified factors that may affect outcome ("period" effects), 78 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients receiving Melphalan-Flu (MF), treated in parallel during this time (1997-2004) were used to estimate the period effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MF patients' outcomes worsened during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the period effect is unlikely to explain the greatly improved outcome with Bu-Flu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients transplanted with Bu-Flu in the first complete remission (CR1) had a 3-year overall survival and event-free-survival (EFS) of 78% and 74%, respectively, whereas CR1 patients younger than age 41 had a 3-year EFS of 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support replacing BuCy +/- ATG with Bu-Flu +/- rabbit-antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and warrant a prospective comparison between allogeneic HSCT and conventional induction/consolidation chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in CR1 </plain></SENT>
