<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A method is described which detects chromosomal 7 loss in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by DNA analysis using a specific hypervariable region gene probe which has been cloned from a human DNA fingerprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of one of the chromosomal 7 homologues was demonstrated in 10/118 MDS patients; the ten patients include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the five patients which had previously been shown to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique makes it feasible to study serial samples from large numbers of patients for loss of chromosomal material and could be readily applied to the study of other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
