<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, it has not previously been described in lymphoid diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the cases of two patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) having a novel idic(20q-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One was a 34-year-old man with B-cell ALL whose leukemic cells at presentation had a karyotype of 45,XY,dic(9;20)(p11;q11.2); at relapse, a small marker chromosome was found coexisting with the dic(9;20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other was a 39-year-old woman with Ph-positive B-cell-ALL whose leukemic cells contained both t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and a small marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of FISH analyses using the appropriate probes revealed the small marker chromosome in both patients to be an idic(20q-), confirming the dic(9;20)(p11;q11.2) in one case and revealing a BCR/ABL fusion gene in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient achieved complete remission but relapsed; the other did not achieve complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients died with a short survival time, despite receiving intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two cases show that idic(20q-) can appear not only in myeloid diseases but also in lymphoid diseases </plain></SENT>
