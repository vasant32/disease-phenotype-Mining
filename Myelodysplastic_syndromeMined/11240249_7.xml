<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1984 and December 1996, 116 patients were conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy and fractionated TBI before allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 34 years (range 3-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TBI dose was given in 6 fractions, twice-a-day, over 3 days before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total dose was 10 Gy in 24 patients, 12 Gy in 66 patients, and 13.5 Gy in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TBI dose was inversely correlated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival was 62% for patients conditioned with 10 Gy, 55% for patients conditioned with 12 Gy, and 46% for patients conditioned with 13.5 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at BMT was also independently correlated with survival, with the best outcome for patients &lt; 40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A TBI dose (fractionated) &gt; 10 Gy may not necessarily be associated with a better outcome in patients undergoing allogeneic bone-marrow transplant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
