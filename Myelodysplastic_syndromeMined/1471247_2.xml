<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mouse monoclonal antibody (FBT3) and immunohistochemistry were used to examine expression of the Tn antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression was not detected in 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow aspirates examined, but it was detected in 5 of 725 abnormal bone marrow aspirates, including 2 (3.6%) of 55 cases of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 2 cases that terminated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and the other in blast transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the Tn antigen was expressed on 2 percent of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid cells expressed the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other two cases, one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and the other of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, only 2 to 8 percent of myeloid and erythroid cells initially were Tn positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent serial immunohistochemical studies of bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in these two cases showed increasing numbers of Tn-positive erythroid and myeloid cells 8 to 12 months before polyagglutination was detected serologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tn-positive cells increased to &gt; 90 percent in the terminal phase in both cases of both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that Tn expression in these two patients may have conferred a growth advantage to the cells and could be related to disease progression </plain></SENT>
