<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses has revealed deletions and/or rearrangments at several chromosomal positions in approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine leiomyomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent genetic alteration, deletion of 7q22, was found in approximately 35% of studied cases with cytogenetic abnormalities (128/366=35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same chromosomal band was also found to be deleted in a fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequent deletion of 7q22 in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> suggest that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene may be located in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The human Cut-like homeobox gene, CUTL1, is one of the genes localized to 7q22 and it was shown previously to encode a transcriptional repressor that down-modulates the expression of c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of the c-Myc oncogenic potential has been shown in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> to result from alterations in one or the other of its several mechanisms of regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations led us to hypothesize that CUTL1 could act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have identified polymorphic markers within and directly adjacent to CUTL1 at 7q22 and demonstrated that these markers are present in a commonly deleted region in seven out of 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine leiomyomas</z:hpo> samples examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Northern blot analysis revealed that CUTL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced in eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> out of 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CUTL1 may act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene whose inactivation could be of pathological importance in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine leiomyomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
