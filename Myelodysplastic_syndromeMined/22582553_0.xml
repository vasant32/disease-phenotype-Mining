<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although morphological diagnosis is a traditional and standard technique that is used for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> blood and bone marrow characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients can potentially obscure the right diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have utilized flow cytometric immunophenotyping as a supportive mechanism to obtain a more accurate and faster method for detection of abnormal markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used for analyzing bone marrow samples from newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to investigate the abnormal antigen expression patterns in granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, lymphoid lineages and myeloid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained from cases that had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormality found in the granulocytic lineage was the decrease of CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low expressions of CD13 were the most frequent abnormality in the monocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The erythroid lineage was found to have low expression of CD235A+/CD71+, reduce of CD71 and decreased CD235a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this method is useful for confirming cases in which it is difficult to make a diagnosis by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
