<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the maximum epidemiologic data attained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with those of two main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panmyelopathies</z:e>, namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (AP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 21,135 patients included in the Bone Marrow Study Registry of the Jiménez Díaz Foundation along 35 years (1959-1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were grouped into seven five-year periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, in the first three the study was performed on bone-marrow aspirates; after 1976 the histopathological study of bone-marrow biopsies was introduced, and since 1979 the karyotype has been regularly examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were classified in accordance with the FAB system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With these premises borne in mind, the following aspects were considered: diagnostic interpretation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> along the years; diagnostic incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and AP in each of the five-year periods; relative frequency of those diagnosis with respect to the total number of cases; evolutive profile of sex and age at diagnosis; quantitative significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>-AL and toxic AP along the years; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes and their epidemiologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 510 MDS, 610 AML and 223 AP cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to the sex of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, some changes have been seen along the years, from an M/F ratio of 1.9 to 1.0; and the mean age at diagnosis raised from 53.3 years (with only 1.7% of the cases over 65 years of age) to 71.4 years (with 76.9% of the cases over 65 years of age), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> this within the 1959-1989 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and AP has remained stable for the last 20 years; on the contrary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been increasing continuously along the 35 years of the study, which poses for a higher number of new cases in every period (from 35 to 119) and also for a higher relative frequency in the registry (from 1.37% to 4.40%) within the period 1959-1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valuable toxic history was progressively increasing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and progressively decreasing in AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With respect to the FAB subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and taking into account the last of the five-year periods, the most frequently diagnosed were RA and RSA followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increment of the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases correlates significantly with the increment of the patients aged over 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This incidence appears to be scarcely influenced by previous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagenic agents</z:chebi> (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) and might be due to a better understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
