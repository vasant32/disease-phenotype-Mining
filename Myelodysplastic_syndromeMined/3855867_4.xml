<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of non-sideroblastic refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> which evolved to a double lymphomyeloproliferative disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At presentation, bone marrow appearances and peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> without myelomonocytosis were consistent with a diagnosis of non-sideroblastic refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient developed pronounced myelomonocytosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> with prolymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light and transmission electron microscopy as well as surface marker studies were compatible with a diagnosis of prolymphocytic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of such double lympho-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> is discussed in the light of the evidence for common lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells and some recent advances in the immunology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
