<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was purposed to explore the molecular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> (NaB) action on SKM-1 cell proliferation/differentiation and to study its synergistic effect with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SKM-1 cells were grown in the absence or presence of NaB and/or ATRA; the percentage of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion; differentiation was investigated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitro-blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) reduction; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules of cell surface were analysed by FACS; cell cycle distribution was studied after DNA staining by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>; D-type cyclins, CDK and P21 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NaB and/or ATRA blocked cells mainly in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; ATRA inhibited the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CDK6, CDK4, cyclin D3 and cyclin D1; NaB inhibited the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CDK2, cyclin D2 and cyclin D1; ATRA and NaB inhibited the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CDK6, CDK4, CDK2, cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and cyclin D3; ATRA and/or NaB both stimulated p21 expression at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the NaB effect on cell proliferation/differentiation may be linked to its ability to induce expression of p21 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and inhibit the cyclin D-CDK complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations support the claim that NaB has the synergistic effect with ATRA </plain></SENT>
