<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were in complete remission for a median follow-up time of 83 months after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) indicated polyclonal haemopoiesis in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had skewed lyonization (i.e. unbalanced XCIPs in both granulocytes and T cells) and one patient presented monoclonal granulocytes together with polyclonal T cells </plain></SENT>
