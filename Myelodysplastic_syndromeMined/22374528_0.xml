<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1 is an 81-year-old male who was diagnosed with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> in July, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He required regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion of 4 units/month when he was started on DSX treatment in June, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four months after the treatment, he became transfusion independent, and has maintained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of around 13 g/dl until today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2 is a 70-year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>-related changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had been on RBC transfusion of 4 units/month when she was started on DSX treatment in January, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months after the treatment, she became transfusion-independent, and 5 months after treatment, blast cells completely disappeared in the peripheral blood, together with normalization of white blood cell and neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Achieving durable transfusion-independency and normalization of white blood cell count and differential with a single use of DSX is a very rare event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective accumulation of more patients and research to understand the mechanism underlying these effects are clearly warranted </plain></SENT>
