<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples were negative or showed very weak expression that was restricted to CD34(+) cells, Dpl was detected in both cell lines and in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed variable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, but barely detectable levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences were confirmed by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRND expression was higher in advanced compared with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.01), but Dpl levels did not predict disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> there was no correlation between Dpl levels and clinical or laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first time that the expression of PRND has been demonstrated in human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism of the observed overexpression is unknown; however, the differential Dpl distribution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus healthy subjects makes it a possible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-associated antigen that could be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
