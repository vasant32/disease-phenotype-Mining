<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that (1) low concentration of As2S2 (0-0.6 mg/L) had no marked inhibition effect on proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells; (2) after treatment with 1.5-50 mg/L of As2S2, both low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells and high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells presented typical features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with a dose-dependent manner, the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and the ratio of bcl-2/bax obviously decreased after As2S2 treatment (P &lt; 0.05); (3) BMMNC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> ratio than that of BMMNC from control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that BMMNC excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> exists in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; low concentration of As2S2 (0-0.6 mg/L) shows no inhibition effect on proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells; high concentration of As2S2 (1.5-50 mg/L) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
