<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of reduced-intensity (RI) conditioning with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from HLA-identical family donors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (median age, 54 years; range, 37 to 66 years) underwent RI-HSCT using a conditioning regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 daily for 5 days and either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 1 g/m2 daily for 2 days (14 patients) or melphalan 140 mg/m2 for 1 day (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median number of CD34+ cells and CD3+ cells infused per kilogram of recipient weight was 4.5 x 106 (range, 1.8 to 7.3 x 106 cells) and 2.9 x 108 (range, 0.1 to 9.6 x 108 cells), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no transplant-related mortality (TRM) within 100 days of HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 1 to 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in three patients, but neither grade 3 nor grade 4 disease was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation but did not develop CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 15 to 45 months), 11 patients are alive (nine in continuous complete remission and one in complete remission after a second transplantation), and five have died (four from disease progression and one from bone-marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> withdrawal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year actuarial overall and event-free survival rates were 69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40% to 86%) and 56% (95% CI, 30% to 68%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This strategy of RI-HSCT resulted in reliable engraftment with low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Durable remissions were observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> consistent with a graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
