<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, low or absent expression of the RB protein is found in 20-30% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a monocytic component (M4 or M5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed Southern blot analysis of the RB gene in 90 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 37 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of them had progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 37/90 patients (including 20 CMML) Northern blot analysis, study of RB protein by immunocytochemistry on bone marrow slides, and detection of point mutations in exons 20-24 of the RB gene was also made, using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No abnormal Southern profile was found in any of the 90 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot and immunocytochemical study of RB protein were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the 37 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SSCP analysis detected a point mutation in 2/37 patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing confirmed the mutation in each case, which involved intron 21 and intron 23, respectively, and was located outside splicing sites of the neighbouring exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that abnormalities of the RB gene and its expression must be very rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and play a minor role, if any, in the pathophysiology of those disorders, at least before progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
