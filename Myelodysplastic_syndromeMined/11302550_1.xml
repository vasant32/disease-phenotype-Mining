<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) have a low risk of relapse, but they have a high risk of nonrelapse mortality when prepared with conventional preparative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To try to reduce nonrelapse mortality, we treated 14 RA patients with a modified approach to total body irradiation (TBI) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and HLA-identical sibling BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 44 years (range, 28 to 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received TBI with shielding of the right lobe of the liver and both lungs followed by electron beam boosts to shielded ribs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total radiation exposure in nonshielded areas was 12 Gy (n = 10), 10 Gy (n = 3), or 6 Gy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After TBI, patients received CY at 120 mg/kg over 2 days, followed by transplantation of unmanipulated bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients initially achieved engraftment with donor cells, although 2 patients had subsequent reemergence of host hematopoiesis without evidence of disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients died of transplantation-related causes between 22 and 1262 days post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients relapsed between 157 and 1096 days post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 14 patients were compared with 46 historical controls with RA who received conventional CY/TBI or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>/CY preparative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in the experimental group had a similar nonrelapse mortality rate compared with the historical control group (29% versus 37%, respectively; P = .8), but a higher relapse rate (34% versus 2%, P = .0004) and a lower disease-free survival (38% versus 61%, P = .16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this modified TBI approach is associated with an unacceptably high risk of relapse for patients with RA undergoing BMT </plain></SENT>
