<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate in vitro pathogenicity of FeLV C-33, bone marrow colony-forming assay was performed on marrow cells infected with FeLV C-33 or an FeLV subgroup A strain (61E, a molecularly cloned strain with minimal pathogenicity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The myeloid colony-forming activity of feline bone marrow mononuclear cells infected with FeLV C-33 was significantly lower than that of cells infected with 61E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that FeLV C-33 has myeloid lineage-specific pathogenicity for cats, and that FeLV C-33 infection is useful as an experimental model for investigating pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
