<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When he was admitted to hospital for PBSCT, a chest X ray showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, and Tc-99m quantitative gated single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (QGS) showed increases in left ventricular (LV) volumes and a decrease in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A coronary angiogram showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventriculography showed similar findings as QGS, and the findings from a myocardial biopsy were compatible with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months after a successful allo-PBSCT with his brother as the donor, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> had been attenuated, the LV volumes decreased and LVEF increased on the QGS images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 10 months later, his cardiac function had deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in cardiac function did not correlate with the hematological changes, such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
