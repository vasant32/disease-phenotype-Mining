<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes bcl-2, survivin and bax were detected by retrotranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the activity of caspase-3 was determined by chemiluminescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the typical apoptotic morphological features appeared in cells treated with VK(2) for 72 hours; VK(2) induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-JSN04 cells and in a dose-and-time-dependent manner, G(0)/G(1) cell arrest and significantly down-regulated the expression of bcl-2 and survivin, but had no effect on the expression of bax; the activity of caspase-3 significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that VK(2) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-JSN04 cells through activating caspase-3 pathways and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes bcl-2, survivin may play an important role in this process </plain></SENT>
