<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples from 20 controls, 41 patients suffering from various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and 19 suffering from ANLL were investigated by in vitro cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cultures were stimulated by various concentrations of leucocyte conditioned medium (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and PHA-stimulated conditioned medium (PCM) and were examined after 7 and 14 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that, in clinically stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, growth patterns and dose-response to CM's were mostly within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With progressive blastic transformation, these features became abnormal with an increase in cluster growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clusters responding to a high dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>, persisting after 14 d and enhanced by PCM may represent 'early' clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These clusters were found in progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with increased numbers of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clusters formed by 'late' clonogenic cells were found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ANLL the disturbance of proliferation and maturation seems to be much more pronounced than in progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with blastic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the interpretation of in vitro bone marrow culture data in terms of a disorderly arrangement of clonogenic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ANLL is facilitated by comparing different conditioned medium stimulations and by scoring after different time intervals </plain></SENT>
