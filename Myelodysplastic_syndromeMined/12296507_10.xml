<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken an investigation in Greece to determine the risk profile of adult de-novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control investigation was conducted in a large Veterans' hospital over a five-year period, covering 84 MDS cases and 84 age- and gender-matched controls with minor non-neoplastic non-infectious conditions from the same study base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls reported to the medically trained principal investigator lifestyle characteristics and medical histories, with emphasis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851754,C0851444" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergic conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alcohol intake and tobacco smoking jointly increased significantly the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (odd ratio contrasting ever smokers and regular drinkers of at least one glass per day to never smokers and drinkers of less than one glass per day: 9.54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>95% CI 3.52-25.82) whereas each of these factors alone had limited effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also evidence that autoimmune conditions, but not allergic disorders, were positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk, irrespective of their occurrence during the recent (less than ten years) or the remote (more than ten years) past (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.15-9.74; OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.19-10.26, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found evidence that both exogenous and endogenous factors may play a role in the etiology of the so-called "de novo" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, but these findings need further confirmation </plain></SENT>
