<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of erythropoietin (EPO) and to study the extent of application of published recommendations for use in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational retrospective study of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> receiving at least one dose of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected from the outpatient database at the Pharmacy Department, and the medical history as well as both clinical and pharmacotherapeutic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical effectiveness of EPO was assessed at 6, 12, 16 and 24 weeks after treatment using two distinct criteria for erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three items were defined and assessed for each patient in order to establish the extent of application of published recommendations on the efficient use of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of them responded to EPO at some point during follow-up, according to pre-defined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three items used in the assessment of the efficient use of EPO showed significantly high inadequacy rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the effectiveness of EPO in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is similar to that described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, upon the assessment of its use in our hospital, this drug was shown not to have been employed according to published recommendations, which promote its cost-effective use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that the cooperation of the Pharmacy Department in the design of a protocol for EPO use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is of interest, and would contribute to EPO's efficient use </plain></SENT>
