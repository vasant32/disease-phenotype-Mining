<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, only six cases of inversion of both homologues have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 3 and duplication of the inverted chromosome have been proposed as the most likely mechanism, but have not been shown experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a 36-year-old male with an initial diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31690">imatinib mesylate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis showed an inversion within the long arm of both homologues of chromosome 3 and an interstitial deletion within the long arm of one chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement of EVI1 locus on both homologues of chromosome 3 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional FISH studies showed a cryptic insertion of ABL1 into the BCR region, and subsequent duplication of the derivative chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The single-nucleotide polymorphism array showed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3 and 22, suggesting that a somatic repair mechanism is involved in the evolution of these genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the complexity of genetic aberrations in neoplastic cells, and the value of array technology, used in concert with conventional cytogenetic methods, for a better understanding of the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
