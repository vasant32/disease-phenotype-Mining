<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a kindred with three affected individuals, with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, suggesting a possible inherited predisposition to this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a molecular genetic approach, we examined whether bands 5q31 or 7q22 or both, the chromosomal regions most frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, are involved in familial expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in this pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis using polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers demonstrated that neither 5q31 nor 7q22 cosegregated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no history of common environmental or occupational exposure among family members with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of polymorphisms at two loci [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase T1 and M1 (GSTT1 and GSTM1)] involved in carcinogen detoxification and associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility, including increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, showed no evidence for enhanced sensitivity to environmental carcinogens in affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings suggest that (1) there is an inherited predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in this kindred; and (2) genes at 5q31 and 7q22, the regions most commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, are excluded from a causal role in this family's disease </plain></SENT>
