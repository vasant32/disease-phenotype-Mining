<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase II study aimed to examine the efficacy of thalidomide in Taiwanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients [intention to treat group (ITT)] with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/day, increased by 100 mg/day weekly to a maximum of 400 mg/day) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients of the ITT group were considered as comprising the evaluable population (EP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thalidomide resulted in hematological improvement (HI) in 28% of ITT analysis and in HI in 40% of the EP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide was more effective for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low to intermediate-1 International Prognostic Score System scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rates were 7% for ITT and 10% for EP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two patients exhibited a cytogenetic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Net reduced levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor cytokines were observed in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of thalidomide-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose thalidomide is an effective and safe treatment for patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
