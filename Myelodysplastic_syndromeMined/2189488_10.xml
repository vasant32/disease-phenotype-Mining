<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied N-ras and Ki-ras point mutations respectively at codons 12-13 and 12 in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for DNA amplification, and slot blot hybridization to allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis and repeatedly during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of the disease to define when the activation occurred and in which haemopoietic cell populations, in order to establish possible relationships between clinical and molecular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three cases the N-ras oncogene was mutated at codon 12 in every cell population, both at diagnosis and throughout the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Point mutations were not seen at the 12 codon of the Ki-ras oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients lacking activated ras oncogene at diagnosis, mutations were not discovered during the entire period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore in our cases disease progression and leukaemic transformation did not correlate with the presence of the activated N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that ras activation occurs early in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and involves a haemopoietic progenitor with multiple differentiative capacity, without however conferring an apparent proliferative advantage on its progeny </plain></SENT>
