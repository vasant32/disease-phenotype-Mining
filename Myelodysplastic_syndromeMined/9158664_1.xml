<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown higher frequencies of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7) in dividing than nondividing myeloid cells, which might indicate that -7 confers a proliferative advantage on the host cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As other groups have not been able to confirm this, we compared the -7 frequencies in bone marrow metaphases as studied with conventional cytogenetics and in interphase cells using primed in situ (PRINS) labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found significantly higher -7 frequencies in metaphase than in interphase cells irrespective of diagnosis and presence or absence of additional chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, we found a significant correlation between the -7 percentages in resting and dividing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, as our material showed a clear male preponderance, Mitelman's Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was searched for -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 815 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 491 (60.3%) were found to be men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first observation of a clear deviation from the 1:1 sex ratio in -7 patients </plain></SENT>
