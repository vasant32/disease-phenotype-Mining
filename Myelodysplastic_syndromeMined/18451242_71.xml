<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent deforolimus in patients with relapsed or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335724" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients were assigned to one of five disease-specific, parallel cohorts and given 12.5 mg deforolimus as a 30-minute infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Simon two-stage design was used for each cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor response were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients received deforolimus as follows: cohort 1 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in nonlymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast phase</z:e>; cohort 2, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; cohort 3, nine agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath>; cohort 4, eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>; cohort 5, nine mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients were heavily pretreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 evaluable patients, partial responses were noted in five (10%), two of seven agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> and three of nine mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematologic improvement/stable disease was observed in 21 (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common treatment-related adverse events, which were generally mild and reversible, were mouth sores, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in 9 of 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients after therapy showed mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> inhibition by deforolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deforolimus was well-tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, and antitumor activity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of deforolimus alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents is warranted in patients with selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
