<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the computed tomography and clinical findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> and pathologically proven secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> were identified from 2000 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six had chest computed tomography scans, which were analyzed retrospectively; medical records were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 30 to 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 1 had cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As in idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp>, geographic ground-glass opacities with or without septal thickening were most common (5/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No axial or zonal predominance was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> as a cause of geographic ground-glass opacities and septal thickening in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> has a low mortality rate, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 2 of our 6 patients implies that secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> may have a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our case of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> associated with cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the first described in the literature </plain></SENT>
