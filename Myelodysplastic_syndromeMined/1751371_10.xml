<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera of 15 healthy controls and 33 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were investigated for soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) expression with a cell-free enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (T-Cell Sciences; Cambridge, U.S.A.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The upper limit of the assay is indicated with 477 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the FAB classification eight refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 15 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), five refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had reported infectious episodes or been under treatment with cytotoxic agents and/or cytokines within the previous 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in sIL-2R levels between RA (median 368 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (median 675 U/ml) and RAEBt (median 971 U/ml) and between RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (median 723 U/ml) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients, who had been under treatment with rhGM-CSF for at least 2 weeks, demonstrated a three- to sevenfold increase of sIL-2R expression compared to pretreatment levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In kinetic evaluation of serum samples for 24 h, the increase of sIL-2R expression begins within 4 h after subcutaneous application of GM-CSF and reaches its maximum after 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data cannot suggest whether increased sIL-2R expression is a primary event due to involvement of lymphocytes in the malignant clone or whether it results from secondary alteration of the cytokine network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Application of GM-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may result in improvement of altered lymphocyte function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As GM-CSF induces sIL-2R expression, a down regulation of the immune response caused by neutralization of free IL-2 cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
