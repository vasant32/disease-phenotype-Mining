<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He responded poorly to induction chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> followed by high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and succumbed to neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple systematic reviews, observational studies and clinical trials were conducted to identify the toxicity profile of hydroxurea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were identified in patients with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, it was concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> is not leukemogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was noted that most of the published studies had only up to 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our patient was started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> in 1990, before the widespread use of the drug and took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> for 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His presentation may reflect an outcome otherwise not yet observed because of the short follow-up of prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that the leukemogenic risk of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> should be discussed with the patients and their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies evaluating the adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> should have longer follow-up before definitive conclusions are drawn </plain></SENT>
