<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcript alterations of this gene were detected in 80% of the primary biopsies and in two of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detected deletions of one or more specific exons in the translated or untranslated portion of the FHIT gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Point mutations in exons 3, 4, and 5 of the FHIT gene were also detected in 4 patients by single stranded conformational PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcript alterations were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary hematopoietic samples which contained chromosome abnormalities, as well as, in hematopoietic disorders which did not show alterations of the 3p14 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest FHIT gene involvement in the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
