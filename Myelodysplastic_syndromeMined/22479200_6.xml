<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to study the correlations between DNA methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) complex following DNA demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SRCAP-mediated H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of constitutively expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>-induced gene reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies, suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers </plain></SENT>
