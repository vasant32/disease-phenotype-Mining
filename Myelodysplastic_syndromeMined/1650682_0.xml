<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both neutrophilic MPO and LF decreased significantly, suggesting the transformation of abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both serum levels of LF and LYZ exhibited a considerable fluctuation which may reflect reflect granulopoiesis in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We are of the opinion that measurement of intracellular MPO, LF, LYZ and their serum levels may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and is proved to be of great clinical significance </plain></SENT>
