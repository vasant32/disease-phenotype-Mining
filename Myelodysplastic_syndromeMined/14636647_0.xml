<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features include the presence of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo>, low erythropoietin (Epo) levels, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-oxygen dissociation curve, hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to exogenous Epo in vitro and no progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less than 15% of PFCP families have an identifiable EPOR mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of other genes are therefore likely responsible for the phenotype of the majority PFCP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we report a family segregating PFCP with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, where 7 of 14 members of the family were affected in four generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This family was studied previously and an EPOR mutation was ruled out by sequencing and by genetic means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we confirmed by linkage analysis that the disease phenotype was not linked to the Epo and EPOR genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then performed a genomewide screen with 410 polymorphic markers at average spacing 7.67 cM to locate the chromosomal region responsible for PFCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified a region in 7q22.1-7q22.2 with a suggestive LOD score of 1.84, from our data this is the most likely location of a candidate region responsible for PFCP in this family </plain></SENT>
