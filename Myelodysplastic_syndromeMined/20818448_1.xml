<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 580 consecutive adults who received a first alloPBSCT from an HLA-identical sibling from 1994 to 2008 at a single institution to describe the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and report the incidence, causes and risk factors for IRM and NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both IRM and NRM decreased with time; within the period of 1994-2000, the 2-year incidence of IRM and NRM was 22 and 31%, respectively, vs 11 and 16% within the period of 2001-2008 (P&lt;0.05 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the variables that increased IRM were within the earlier period of 1994-2000 (P&lt;0.01), poor performance status (P&lt;0.01), grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (P&lt;0.001) and invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (IFI) (P&lt;0.001) or CMV disease (P&lt;0.001) after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to NRM, earlier time period was also identified as a risk factor (P&lt;0.001), as well as IFIs (P&lt;0.001) and CMV disease (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the conditioning regimen had no effect on IRM and NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed a significant reduction in IRM and NRM over a period of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of IFIs and CMV disease continue to have an impact on NRM </plain></SENT>
