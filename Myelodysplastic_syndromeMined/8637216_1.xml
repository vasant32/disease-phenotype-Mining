<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined levels of expression and enzymatic activity of p55(c-fgr) peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) by comparison with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While neutrophils of eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects gave uniform results, the specific enzymatic activity of p55(c-fgr), a ratio of the total kinase activity versus the protein level was reduced in seven out of eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of five patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific kinase activity of p55(c-fgr) correlated significantly with the activity of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) which has been considered to be a marker of neutrophil maturity (r=0.568, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduced activity of this tyrosine kinase was considered to be a biological parameter for immaturity and to reflect dysfunction of neutrophils of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
