<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the abnormal expression of microRNA-124 (miR-124) in bone marrow cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and its significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative expression levels of miR-124 in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 33 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (as controls) were detected by stem-loop fluorescence real-time quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methylation levels of miR-124 promoter were detected by quantitative methylation specific PCR in partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, lower levels of miR-124 (≤ 1/3) were found in 2/18 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients and in 5/15 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (among them ≤ 1/4 in 3/15 MDS patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significance difference was observed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P = 0.725) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However the difference was statistically significant between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group and control group (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an elevated methylation level of miR-124 promoter region in some of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (7/11) was detected by using quantitative methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression level of miR-124 was related with methylation level of promoter region (R(2) = 0.339, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of miR-124 in partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is inhibited, which may be associated with the abnormal methylation of its promoter </plain></SENT>
