<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A female patient showed rejection of a T-lymphocyte-depleted bone-marrow graft from her phenotypically HLA-identical father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before bone-marrow transplantation, there was strong recipient anti-donor cellular cytotoxic reactivity directed against several minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens, including the male-specific H-Y antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After conditioning treatment, no recipient anti-donor cytotoxic activity could be detected, and good graft function was shown a month after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, however, graft function deteriorated rapidly, while recipient-derived anti-donor cellular cytotoxic reactivity, against similar mH antigens, reappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recipient-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes could completely inhibit growth of donor haemopoietic progenitor cells both before and after bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes can survive very intensive conditioning regimens, and residual recipient cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against mH antigens expressed on donor haemopoietic progenitor cells may cause graft rejection after HLA-identical T-lymphocyte-depleted bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
