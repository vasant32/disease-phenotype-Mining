<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective, community-based study evaluated the effectiveness of pegfilgrastim in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were also receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged &gt; or = 18 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer other</z:e> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were eligible, including patients with major comorbidities who were generally not eligible for most clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key exclusions were weekly chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received pegfilgrastim 6 mg approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy in each cycle (up to 8 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included neutropenic complications and serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This open-label single-arm study enrolled 2249 patients at 319 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 2249 patients, 325 patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> were included in the primary analysis set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age was 65 years for patients with NHL and 41 years for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>, and 31% and 26% had major comorbidities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Few patients experienced neutropenic complications, including grade 4 febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>: 0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 13% [95% CI, 10%-17%]); febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related hospitalization (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 10% [95% CI, 7%-14%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related dose reduction (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related dose delay (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%]) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy supported by pegfilgrastim experienced few neutropenic complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related alterations in chemotherapy dose and schedule </plain></SENT>
