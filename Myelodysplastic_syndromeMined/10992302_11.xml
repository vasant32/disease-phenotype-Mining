<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using combined immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), studies were carried out on bone marrow smears of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> cases to identify the cell lineages carrying the 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, the granulocytic, monocytic, and erythroid lineages possessed the del(5q) clonal marker, whereas the T-lymphocytes did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one case, cells of B-lymphoid lineage also showed the presence of the del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to date showing involvement of an acquired 5q deletion associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that in some cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> arises in a multipotent cell with a capacity to differentiate into both myeloid and lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
