<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first case, there were clinical and biological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow (BM) karyotype demonstrated a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, FISH analysis showed that an alpha-satellite DNA sequence had been transferred from chromosomes 13/21 to one homologue of chromosomes 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BCR-ABL rearrangement was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second case, at diagnosis, the karyotype was 46,XX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis with the simultaneous and individual application of abl and bcr probes for chromosome 9 and 22, respectively, revealed the presence of the BCR-ABL rearrangement in addition to an extra ABL sequence locating chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clone that was BCR-ABL gene rearrangement negative but with an extra ABL DNA sequence on chromsome 20, and another clone that was BCR-ABL gene rearrangement negative were detected by DC-FISH and uni-colour (UC-) FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was detected by conventional cytogenetic or FISH analyses </plain></SENT>
