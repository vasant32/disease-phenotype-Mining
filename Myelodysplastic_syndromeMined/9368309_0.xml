<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, since studies of A-bomb survivors indicate that the peak in morbidity may occur more than 10 years after radiation exposure, long-term studies of hemoblastoses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are needed today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are potentially induced by ionizing radiation must include both fundamental and applied approaches, i.e., A) epidemiological design; B) utilization of modern methods of diagnosis (cytomorphology, immunocytochemistry, cytogenetics); C) studies of gene mutations, mechanisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and G1 delay; D) monitoring of oncogene and multidrug resistance gene expression, and E) tracking changes in cell-cell signaling in the bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
