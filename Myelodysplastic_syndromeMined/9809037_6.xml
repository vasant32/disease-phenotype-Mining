<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been two previous reports in the literature of eosinophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with dic(1;7) or t(1;7) in which eosinophil clonality was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific breakpoints on chromosomes 1 and 7 differ in the three cases, making it difficult to implicate disruption of a single gene as causative; nevertheless, the nonrandom occurrence of t(1;7) or dic(1;7) with malignant eosinophilic proliferations suggests that this chromosomal rearrangement is involved in the etiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
