<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Markedly reduced or absent colony formation was found in 67% of the patients for CFU-Meg and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) for BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CFU-GM colony formation was found in only 5 of 12 patients with RA and RA with ring sideroblasts, in contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the RA patients with excess of blasts and excess of blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defective colony formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lineages was seen in 63% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colony number of CFU-Meg correlated significantly with the numbers of both BFU-E and CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is disturbed due to a qualitative or quantitative defect at the multipotent stem cell level </plain></SENT>
