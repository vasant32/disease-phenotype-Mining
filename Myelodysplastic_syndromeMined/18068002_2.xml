<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radioimmunotherapy is a molecular targeting treatment for high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49882">Rhenium</z:chebi>-188-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody has been used successfully in patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish the biokinetics of (188)Re-anti-CD20 in patients and to evaluate its dosimetry as a target-specific radiopharmaceutical for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole-body images were acquired at various times after administration of (188)Re-anti-CD20, obtained from instant freeze-dried kit formulations with radiochemical purity &gt;95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around source organs in each time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cpm of each ROI was converted to activity using the conjugate view counting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The image sequence was used to extrapolate time-activity curves in each organ to calculate the total number of disintegrations (N) that occurred in the source regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N data were the input for the OLINDA/EXM code to calculate internal radiation dose estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dosimetric studies indicated that after administration of 4.87-8.72 GBq of (188)Re-anti-CD20, the absorbed dose to total body would be 0.75 Gy, which corresponds with the recommended dose for NHL therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The calculated absorbed doses of (188)Re-anti-CD20 indicate that it may be used in radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these preliminary data justify a full assessment of the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of (188)Re-anti-CD20 in a clinical study </plain></SENT>
