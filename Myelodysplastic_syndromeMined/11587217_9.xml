<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of p15 methylation was very low in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells and in CD34+ and CD34- subpopulations (0-6.5%; med, = 2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P15INK4B transcripts were present in each of these cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, methylation was the usual situation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of methylation of the p15INK4B gene did not always indicate an absence of expression nor was expression always present if methylation was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P15INK4B methylation was studied in the marrows of nine patients (one studied twice) who had been cured of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in whom hemopoiesis was believed to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased methylaton was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that p15INK4B methylation is likely to be a very early event in the development of the secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
