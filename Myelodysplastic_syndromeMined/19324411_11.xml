<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a large population-based study to assess the role of comorbidity in the survival of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included 1708 MDS patients (age &gt; or =66 years) diagnosed in the US during 2001-2002, with follow-up through the end of 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was approximately 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty one percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with comorbid conditions had significantly greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than those without comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HR was 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.36) and 1.77 (95% CI: 1.50-2.08) for those with a Charlson index of 1-2 and &gt; or = 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increases with Charlson index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> had significantly shorter survival than patients without those conditions, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not appear to have an impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms comorbidity as a significant and independent determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> survival, and the findings underscore the importance to take comorbid conditions into account when assessing the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
