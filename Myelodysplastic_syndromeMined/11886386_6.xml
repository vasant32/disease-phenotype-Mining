<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies have not been reported in bone marrow (BM) biopsies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) owing to failure to overcome the technical impediment of maintaining ultrastructural detail in decalcified tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a modified technique to physically separate pieces of bone from marrow tissue under a dissecting microscope, and embedding the material directly for TEM, ultrastructural studies were performed in 15 MDS patients and four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy tissue was also used to initiate long-term in vitro cultures and 12-week plates were sacrificed for TEM analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Features noted in freshly obtained decorticated tissue included an excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both haematopoietic and stromal cells, ringed sideroblasts with iron-laden mitochondria and highly active, enormously increased phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, type IV nuclear inclusion body variants (NIB-v) and confronting cylindrical cisternae (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) were readily identified in up to 40% of stromal cells in vivo, providing an important footprint of a possible infectious agent in the pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultured stromal cells did not show excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and only 2-4% fibroblasts showed the presence of NIB-v or <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>, underscoring the artificial nature of ex vivo systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ultrastructure studies using decorticated tissue can be a powerful tool to investigate the biology and aetiology of a variety of haematopoietic disorders as it enables the direct examination of BM biopsies with their intimate stromal parenchymal cell associations preserved intact </plain></SENT>
