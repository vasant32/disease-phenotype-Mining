<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated liver R2 measurements were made using both protocols on 60 subjects with liver iron concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48.6 mg Fe (g dry tissue)(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean total scan time at repetition time 1000 ms was 42% of that at repetition time 2500 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The repeatability coefficients for the two protocols were not significantly different from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systematic difference in the measured R2 using each protocol was found indicating that an adjustment factor is required when one protocol is used to replace the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 95% limits of agreement between the two protocols were not significantly different from their repeatability coefficients indicating that the protocols can be interchanged without any significant change in accuracy or precision of liver iron concentration measurement </plain></SENT>
