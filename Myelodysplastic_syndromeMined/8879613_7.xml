<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplant one patient had stage II and 10 patients had stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients had refractory disease, two had chemotherapy sensitive disease and five had progressed after an initial response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 353 days (range 176-6118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After transplant, the median time to achieve granulocytes of 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelets of 20 x 10(9)/l was 12 days (range 9-20) and 12 days (9-27), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> syndrome on day 32 and one died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">veno-occlusive disease of the liver</z:e> on day 44 post-transplant, and these were unevaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of nine evaluable patients achieved a complete response (CR), three a partial response, and one patient had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients who did not achieve CR died of progressive disease 106, 142 and 321 days post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of five patients who achieved a CR, three relapsed on days 539, 737 and 1706 and died on days 1759, 1596 and 1736, respectively; one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> on day 1407 without evidence of MM and one patient is alive and disease-free 3297 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the two long-term survivors has a persistent monoclonal protein in the blood 15 years post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data show that high-dose therapy and infusion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> syngeneic marrow cells can cure a small fraction of patients with MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of patients did not achieve durable CR, demonstrating the need for improved transplant conditioning regimens, earlier transplant or additional post-transplant treatment strategies when syngeneic transplants are performed </plain></SENT>
