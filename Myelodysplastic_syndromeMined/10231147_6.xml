<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the patient complained of almost no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion, he had mild hypercapnea with a markedly reduced forced expiratory volume of 0.32 l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest X-rays showed occasional bilateral minimal pneumothoraces, which is in accordance with the existence of multiple small bullae found on the pleural surface at video-assisted thoracic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the biopsied lung revealed BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case indicates that BO in adolescence following BMT and possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD may be masked because of lung immaturity at BMT, and BO after BMT may be associated with multiple pleural bullae </plain></SENT>
