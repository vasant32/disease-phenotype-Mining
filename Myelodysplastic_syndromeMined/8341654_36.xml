<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, previous studies have shown that aberrant expression of the Evi-1 gene in a myeloid progenitor cell line blocks granulocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the aberrant expression of the Evi-1 gene impairs the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response of erythroid cells or bone-marrow progenitors to erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid differentiation has been shown to require the GATA-1 transcription factor that binds to a sequence contained within the consensus binding sequence identified for Evi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the studies presented here we also show that Evi-1 can repress GATA-1-dependent transactivation in transient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together the data support the hypothesis that inappropriate expression of the Evi-1 gene blocks erythropoiesis by repressing the transcription of a subset of GATA-1 target genes </plain></SENT>
