<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 49 of 56 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy persons (88%), the levels were beneath the sensitivity of the assay (less than 30 pg/mL), while in the remaining seven healthy persons, the levels ranged from 33 to 163 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, nine of 11 patients (82%) with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), one patient with Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, six of 12 patients (50%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), five of 12 patients (42%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> without any blast cells in the blood (M4: one, M5: one, L1: one, and L2: two), six of 18 patients (33%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), one of two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), two of four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, one patient with cyclic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, two of seven patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had G-CSF levels ranging from 46 pg/mL to greater than 2,000 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a reverse correlation between blood neutrophil count and serum G-CSF level was clearly demonstrated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (r = -.8169, P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was found that the G-CSF level rose during the neutropenic phase of cyclic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; also high G-CSF levels were positively correlated to blood neutrophil counts in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disorders</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cellular sources and the mechanisms for production and secretion of circulating G-CSF were not investigated in this study, but the data presented here strongly indicate that G-CSF plays an important role as a circulating neutrophilopoietin </plain></SENT>
