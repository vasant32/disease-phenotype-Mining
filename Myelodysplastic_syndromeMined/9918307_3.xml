<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the technique of ISEL of fragmented DNA appears to be an accurate and reliable measurement of the early stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken in order to define the incidence of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in bone marrow (BM) haematopoietic and stromal cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ISEL technique was employed in 21 BM biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis showed that in 11/21 patients, &gt;70% cells (high score) were undergoing programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while 5 patients showed up to 1/3 of the biopsy containing apoptotic cells and 2 patients had only few occasional ISEL positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stromal cells including fat cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts were frequently in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in large clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of haematopoietic cells documented in BM biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may be the explanation for the ineffective haematopoiesis which is the hallmark of these disorders </plain></SENT>
