<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the hypermethylation of the p15INK4B gene promoter was frequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and that it may be associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unanswered question is whether p15INK4B gene methylation is restricted to undifferentiated blastic cells, or whether differentiated cells such as granulocytes or erythrocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> origin also harbor this epigenetic alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of the p15INK4B gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method, which is more sensitive than Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of 23 MDS patients were analyzed, and six of them showed p15INK4B methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progenitor assay with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> medium was also performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two of the six patients with p15INK4B-methylated BM-MNCs, erythroid and/or non-erythroid colonies formed were subjected to molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonies with and without p15INK4B methylation were detected in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern of each colony was simultaneously determined by MSP-based human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene analysis (HUMARA-MSP), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p15INK4B-methylated colonies showed the same XCI pattern, which was dominant among the colonies, while p15INK4B-unmethylated colonies showed both patterns of XCI, in each of the two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then examined the methylation status of the p15INK4B gene of granulocyte (PB-PMN) fractions from 10 patients with available peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with p15INK4B-methylated BM-MNCs, their PB-PMNs showed p15INK4B methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that p15INK4B methylation in hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is restricted to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone but not necessarily to blast cells </plain></SENT>
