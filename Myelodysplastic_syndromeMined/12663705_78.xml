<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six complete NSABP trials have investigated AC regimens (B-15, B-16, B-18, B-22, B-23, and B-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six distinct AC regimens have been tested and are distinguished by differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> intensity and cumulative dose and by the presence or absence of mandated prophylactic support with growth factor and ciprofloxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regimens, A was given at 60 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C was given as follows: 600 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4 ("standard AC"); 1,200 mg(2) q 21 days x 2; 1,200 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4; 2,400 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 2; and 2,400 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was summarized by incidence per 1,000 patient-years at risk and by cumulative incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates were compared across regimens, by age, and by treatment with or without breast radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was sharply elevated in the more intense regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving two or four cycles of C at 2,400 mg/m(2) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> at 5 years was 1.01% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63% to 1.62%), compared with 0.21% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.41%) for patients treated with standard AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who received breast radiotherapy experienced more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than those who did not (RR = 2.38, P=.006), and the data indicated that G-CSF does may possibly also be independently correlated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AC regimens employing intensified doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> requiring G-CSF support were characterized by increased rates of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, although the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was small relative to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Breast radiotherapy appeared to be associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
