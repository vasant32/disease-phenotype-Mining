<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of a broad phase I study of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rh GM-CSF), four patients were treated who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF was given daily as an intravenous injection over a period of 30 min for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 cycles were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient received at least two different dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients, three different dosages were delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment course was interrupted by a 10-day rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rh GM-CSF was well tolerated, with only minor side effects seen, which included bone discomfort at the lower back, sternum and ribs, and constitutional symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas no increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts were recorded, elevations of absolute neutrophil counts above 100 cells/microliters occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was, however, the development of increases in the number of circulating and bone marrow blast counts that were observed particularly when doses of greater than or equal to 500 micrograms/m2 of body surface area were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In line with data demonstrating in vitro induction of proliferation of leukemic blast cells by rh GM-CSF, one may take advantage of blastogenesis induced in vivo that may favor the use of a therapeutic strategy by recruiting quiescent cells into the mitotic cycle which would then represent optimum targets for a subsequent cycle-specific cytotoxic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such an approach could form the basis for new clinical trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
