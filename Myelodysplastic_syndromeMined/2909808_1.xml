<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured serum and urine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> levels by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27543,3391">carbazole</z:chebi> method of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27252">uronic acid</z:chebi> determination in patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were studied during active disease as well as eight in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels in patients with active disease did not differ significantly from 11 healthy volunteers with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the median urine level for the patients with active disease was 7.6 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33549">uronate</z:chebi>/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> (Creat) compared to 2.6 for controls (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the eight patients in complete remission also had a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33549">uronate</z:chebi> excretion with a median of 7.3 (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that elevated urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are not due to impaired ability of the liver to clear circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> or overproduction by leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> excretion may be due to altered bone marrow matrix metabolism that is often not reversed by the achievement of hematologic remission </plain></SENT>
