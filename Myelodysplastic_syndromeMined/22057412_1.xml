<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effectiveness of Qinghuang Powder (QHP) combined with Bupi Yishen Decoction (, BPYS) in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and its relationship with France, America, and Britain (FAB) type, international prognosis scaling system (IPSS) risk, and chromosome karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 124 MDS patients subjected to the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By FAB typing, 91 patients were typed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) type and 33 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) type; by IPSS scale, 21 were sorted to low risk, 77 to moderate risk I, 20 to moderate risk II, and 6 to high risk; 78 of them had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome and 46 with abnormal chromosome, including 26 of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with QHP+BPYS, and the changes of peripheral blood figure and bone marrow were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, the general effective rate was 72.58% (90/124), which in the patients of RA type was 80.22% (73/91) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> type 51.52% (17/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former was better than that in the later (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the analysis in the patients of different IPSS risk degrees, the effective rate was 95.24% (20/21) in the lowrisk group, 72.73% (56/77) in moderate risk I, 65.00% (13/20) in moderate-risk II, and 16.67% (1/6) in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those in the first two groups were superior to that in the latter two (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effective rate was 79.49% (61/78) in the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome and was 60.87% (28/46) in the patients with abnormal chromosome, showing a significant difference between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While in the patients of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, it was 73.08% (19/26), which was parallel to that in the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of QHP+BPYS comprehensive therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is unquestionably good, and it is markedly correlated with the FAB type and IPSS risk degree of the disease, as well as the normality of chromosome in the patient </plain></SENT>
