<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 41 years (range 23-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had transfusion-dependent refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients suffered from more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 15 being in complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 31 recipients, pretransplant conditioning consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and TBI with or without the addition of idarubucin; four patients were conditioned with other schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Donors were genotypically HLA-identical and MLC-negative siblings in 32, and others in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a graft depleted of 98% of T lymphocytes using counterflow centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients are alive and in continuous remission with a median follow-up of 20 months (range 15-113) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients relapsed between 3 and 18 months after BMT and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen transplantation-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome in patients under and over 40 years old was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years after BMT was 39% (95% confidence interval (CI), 22-56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considering patients with HLA-identical and MLC-negative sibling donors transplanted for RA (n = 11) or more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in CR (n = 14), the probabilities of DFS were 73% (95% CI, 47-99%) and 42% (95% CI, 15-69%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This indicates that BMT with lymphocyte-depleted grafts can cure a substantial number of relatively old patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially when grafts from HLA-identical and MLC-negative siblings are used and patients are suffering from RA </plain></SENT>
