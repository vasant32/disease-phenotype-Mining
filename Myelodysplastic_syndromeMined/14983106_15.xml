<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical aspects and evolution of autoimmune inflammatory manifestations (AIMs) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and ascertain the prognostic implications of these manifestations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients diagnosed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled in a prospective cohort study of 4-yr duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with AIMs were identified (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 57 MDS patients without AIMs constituted the control group (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical features, laboratory data, treatment and outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On comparing features between the two groups we were unable to identify any particular difference (P &gt; or = 0.05) concerning bone marrow blast count [odds ratio (OR) = 0.68], international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) (OR = 1.36), favourable cytogenetic abnormalities (OR = 0.52), leukaemic transformation (OR = 1.30) and survival (P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore there was a significant difference in survival between low vs non-low IPSS patients for both groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a 4-yr prospective study the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with AIMs appeared to be closely related to the IPSS subcategory of the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> and not to the autoimmune process </plain></SENT>
