<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the 10-year follow-up data of aggressive NHL classified according to the Kiel classification and treated with MACOP-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1991, 71 patients with aggressive NHL were treated in a single institution with MACOP-B and adjuvant radiotherapy as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NHL subtypes were classified according to the updated Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available until 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) at 10 years is 45% (confidence interval 33-57%), the progression-free survival 42% (30-54%), and the relapse-free survival of the 59 patients (82%) in complete remission is 52% (39-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kiel classification combined with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) identified diffuse large B-cell and anaplastic large T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with IPI 0-2 as subgroups with very favorable prognosis after MACOP-B (OS 84% and 80% at 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late relapses (&gt;2 years after therapy) did occur in these patients but had a good prognosis after second remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 24 relapses were in the radiation field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died of toxicity, 1 during MACOP-B (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were age and pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients suffered from chemotherapy-associated mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>Osteoporosis</z:hpo> was a common late toxicity (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were observed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MACOP-B in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy is highly effective in diffuse large B-cell or anaplastic large T-cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with IPI 0-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with IPI &gt;2 or with centrocytic or secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> B-cell or non-anaplastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> need more intensive therapy or novel approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Regarding the toxicity profile, MACOP-B should be replaced by VACOP-B </plain></SENT>
