<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively analyzed matched pairs of bone marrow and buccal cell (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) DNA samples from 51 MDS patients by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and identified somatically acquired clonal genomic abnormalities in 21 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 33 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cell karyotypes, 5 (15%) had clonal, somatically acquired aberrations by SNP array analysis, including 4 with segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> (UPD) and 1 with three separate microdeletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each abnormality was detected more readily in CD34+ cells than in unselected bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paired analysis of bone marrow and buccal cell DNA from each patient was necessary to distinguish true clonal genomic abnormalities from inherited copy number variations and regions with apparent loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UPDs affecting chromosome 7q were identified in two patients who had a rapidly deteriorating clinical course despite a low-risk International Prognostic Scoring System score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies of larger numbers of patients will be needed to determine whether 7q UPD detected by SNP array analysis will identify higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at diagnosis, analogous to those with 7q cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
