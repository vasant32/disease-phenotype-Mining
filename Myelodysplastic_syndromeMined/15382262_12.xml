<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified the extra material on 11p as belonging to chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metaphase FISH with probes for chromosomes 5, 11, and 15 revealed a complex four-break rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clone RP5-1173K1, containing exons 10-20 of the NUP98 gene, gave three fluorescence signals on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 11, the der(5), and the der(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3'-RACE-PCR identified an in-frame fusion between NUP98 and NSD1, which was confirmed by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two different spliced forms, that is, NUP98 exon 11/NSD1 exon 6 and NUP98 exon 12/NSD1 exon 6, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal NSD1/NUP98 was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dual-color experiment with RP5-1173K1 and CTC-549A4, spanning the entire NSD1 gene, indicated an insertion of NUP98 into the NSD1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of an adult with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) harboring an NUP98/NSD1 fusion resulting from insertion of 5'-NUP98 into the NSD1/5q35 locus </plain></SENT>
