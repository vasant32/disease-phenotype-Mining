<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the response and tolerance to long-term treatment using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> (13-CRA) in transfusion-dependent patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and to determine the effects of therapy on the natural history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients with transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> seen in a medical school hospital and outpatient clinic from 1981 to 1988 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first 21 patients were treated with 13-CRA alone and the next 45 patients with 13-CRA plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared responses to and toxicities of therapy, rates of transformation, and survival from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of therapy in 20 evaluable patients treated with 13-CRA alone and 43 patients treated with 13-CRA plus AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients responded (20%) at 4 to 8 months to 13-CRA alone, but this response was associated with considerable toxicity and resulted in cessation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the responders, only one continued therapy and is currently in remission, whereas three discontinued therapy because of toxicity and have had a relapse and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 13-CRA plus AT group, we observed one prolonged complete remission and 10 partial remissions (26%), with a decrease in skin and constitutional toxicities by the addition of AT, which enabled the continuation of 13-CRA indefinitely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the response rates were similar in both groups, fewer patients (28% versus 60%) experienced progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in the 13-CRA plus AT group than in the group receiving 13-CRA alone, who terminated treatment (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A twofold increase in median survival of the RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patient groups was observed with 13-CRA plus AT but was not significant (p greater than 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows a 20% to 26% response rate to 13-CRA and suggests that 13-CRA, if given continuously, decreases the rate of progression or transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of AT ameliorates the toxicity of 13-CRA and allows for long-term treatment with 13-CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since the standard treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is currently unsatisfactory, these findings indicate that longer treatment with a non-marrow-suppressive agent such as 13-CRA is important, and further trials to determine the role of 13-CRA plus AT in combination with new recombinant growth factors in the therapy for transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should offer a new approach to a disease common in the elderly population </plain></SENT>
