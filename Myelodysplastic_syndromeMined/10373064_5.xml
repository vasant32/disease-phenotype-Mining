<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are increasingly being reported after autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient dysplastic changes have also been observed after this type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, to the best of our knowledge no systematic morphological analysis has been performed to determine the influence of stem cell transplantation on bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 53 patients undergoing autologous transplantation, we evaluated the bone marrow, before and 6 and 12 months after the transplant, in order to analyze the appearance of dyshemopoietic changes, assessed according to a pre-established score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied 25 bone marrow samples obtained at the time of diagnosis, prior to treatment, but we did not find morphological atypia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after transplant, cellularity and thrombopoiesis had decreased in 38% and 49% of patients respectively, although 1 year after the process they were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was already present in bone marrow before transplantation and continued to be in evidence for a long time afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that chemotherapy and radiotherapy used prior to transplantation are responsible for dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The myeloid line was the most affected with 100% of patients showing dysgranulopoiesis 1 year after autografting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytopenias were observed in 51% and 44% of patients 6 and 12 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, concomitant presence of cytopenia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was observed in 37.7% of patients at 6 months after transplantation and 25% at 12 months, and therefore they could be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data contrast with the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> reported in earlier publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to these findings, the value of the French-American-British Co-operative Group criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> following autologous transplantation is questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since dyshemopoietic features are almost always present after autologous transplant, morphological criteria are not useful for early recognition of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
