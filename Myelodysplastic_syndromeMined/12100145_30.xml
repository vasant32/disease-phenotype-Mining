<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential advantage of a prolonged administration of rHuEpo to achieve higher erythroid response rates (RR) in 281 MDS patients: 118 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 77 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 59 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and blast count &lt; 10% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e>), and 27 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and blast count between 11-20% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rHuEpo was given subcutaneously at a dose of 150 U/kg thrice weekly, for a minimum of 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was evaluated after 12 and 26 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall RR was 45.1%; the RR for RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> were 48.3%, 58.4%, 33.8% and 13% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in RR was observed at week 26 in RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> patients, as the response probability increased with treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RR was higher in the good cytogenetic prognostic group and serum Epo level of &gt; 150 U/l at baseline predicted for non-response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 68 weeks and the overall risk of leukaemic transformation was 21.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that prolonged administration of rHuEpo produces high and long-lasting erythroid RR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low blast counts, particularly in those with pretreatment serum Epo levels of &lt; 150 U/l and good cytogenetic prognosis </plain></SENT>
