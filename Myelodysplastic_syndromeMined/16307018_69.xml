<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative merits of each may differ in different settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the role of dose intensity, we analyzed SCT outcomes of 112 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 patients met eligibility criteria for standard myeloablative conditioning and were given intravenous-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (12.8 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (ivBuCy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 67 noneligible patients were given RIC with fludarabine and intravenous-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (6.4 mg/kg, FB2, n=41) or a modified myeloablative regimen with fludarabine and myeloablative doses of intravenous-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (12.8 mg/kg, FB4, n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 50, 49 and 47% after ivBuCy, FB4 and FB2, respectively (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality was higher after ivBuCy, 22 vs 8% (P=0.05), but relapse rates were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Active disease at SCT was the most significant predictor of reduced survival in multivariable analysis (HR 4.5, P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myeloablative and RIC regimens had similar outcomes when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was in remission at SCT; however, patients with active disease could only be salvaged by myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, OS was 45% after ivBuCy but no FB2 recipient survived (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease, ineligible for standard myeloablation, could tolerate modified myeloablation well; however, long-term outcome cannot be determined yet </plain></SENT>
