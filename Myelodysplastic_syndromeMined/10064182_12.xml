<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As more pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) survive, comparison of the late effects of various therapies becomes increasingly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study of survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is the largest to date comparing the late effects of patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) with or without irradiation (RT) or CT followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: In a retrospective review of 228 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from 1970 to 1995, 62 survived and had follow-up data available more than 1 year following completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six received CT and 26 underwent BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight and height Z scores, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, ophthalmologic, renal, and cardiac function following CT +/- RT or BMT +/- total body irradiation (TBI) were compared at a mean follow-up of 7.4 and 5.6 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups experienced a decrement in height and increase in weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean height Z score in the CT group fell from -0.29 to -0.72 (P = 0.02) and mean weight Z score rose from -0.06 at diagnosis (T0) to 0.51 at last follow-up (T2) (P = 0.02), a finding no longer significant when patients who received RT were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean height Z score in the BMT group fell from -0.17 at TO to -0.65 at T2 (P = 0.02), while the mean weight rose from 0.29 at T0 to 0.84 at T2, (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of 9 BMT adolescent girls experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian failure</z:e> versus 0 of 11 girls treated with CT (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven adolescent CT males and seven BMT males showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pubertal progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two BMT patients require thyroid hormone supplementation, and one receives growth hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six BMT patients and one CT patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received irradiation (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or left ventricular shortening fraction were not different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One BMT patient has <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Growth, renal, and cardiac functions were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> supplementation was more frequent following BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recommendations concerning therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> should depend on the probability of cure </plain></SENT>
