<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, 40%-50% have at least one chromosomal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of specific chromosomal regions like 5q- and 7q- are usually the secondary cytogenetic abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to detect chromosome abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, bone marrow samples from 26 patients diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were obtained prior to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both conventional cytogenetic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) methods were performed and locus-specific probes for 5q and 7q were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results obtained were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and four patients had abnormal karyotypes, while in one patient we could not obtain metaphases from cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes revealed del (5q), two patients had del (7q) and one patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 of 26 patients had chromosome changes visualised by either conventional or molecular cytogenetics (approximately 38.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that both methods are important in diagnosis and follow up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When used together, conventional cytogenetics and FISH detect clinically significant chromosome abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
