<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the methylation status of the CpG island of SALL4 promoter region in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant hypomethylation of SALL4 gene was found in 21.7% (18/83) of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly positive correlation was identified between the level of SALL4 transcript and the status of SALL4 hypomethylation (R=0.641, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between SALL4 hypomethylation and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of SALL4 hypomethylation significantly increased in higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (14% in Low/Int-1 versus 39% in Int-2/High, P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between SALL4 hypomethylation and the mutations in three methylation modifiers (IDH1, IDH2 and DNMT3A) was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the estimated 50% survival time of the SALL4-hypomethylated group was shorter than that of SALL4-methylated group (11.0 months vs. 20.0 months), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.430) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that hypomethylation of SALL4 promoter is a common event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
