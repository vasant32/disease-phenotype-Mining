<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a previous study by the authors, a Hum-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mice model was successfully established and the results showed that ATO alone or in combination with THAL had markedly inhibitory effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors growth</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mice model of the treated groups with higher-rates of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and longer-survival periods than control groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 48 Hum-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mice were randomly grouped and ATO groups had 32 mice which were treated with ATO [5.0 microg or 7.5 microg/(g.d), 5 d a week, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) x 3 weeks alone or in combination with THAL 8 microg/(g.d) x 3 weeks] and the control groups had 16 mice [treated with 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 10 microl/(g.d) (i.p) or untreated] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of the proteins and the genes related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were detected by using immunohistochemical (IHC) method, Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with [gamma-32P] ATP oligonucleotide probe end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) By IHC, compared to controls, the expressions of the pro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein Bax (F = 1080.150, P &lt; 0.01) and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were higher, but Bcl-2 (F = 2777.978, P &lt; 0.01) was lower in the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Western-blot results showed that the pro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein expressions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Smac/DIABLO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C (IHC) were strikingly up-regulated and pro-caspase 9, 7, 6, 3 and full PARP were down-regulated and cleaved caspase-6, 7, 9 and PARP were clearly observed in the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein inhibitors of cIAP1 and survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (RT-PCR) were markedly down-regulated in the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But no evidences of cleavage of BID and caspase-8 had been observed in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) The expression of IkappaB-alpha protein [nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) inhibitor] was up-regulated (Western-blot) and the activity of NF-kappaB were sharply down-regulated in ATO-treated groups by EMSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mitochondria are the primary intracellular target of ATO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At least, two pathways, namely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mediated-caspase dependent cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway and NF-kappaB signal conduct pathway were involved in the mechanisms of ATO inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mice model in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms seem to be a complicated network regulated by multi-signal pathways, multi-layers, and multi-factors instead of a single pathway </plain></SENT>
