<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several small clinical studies give divergent informations about the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> as single agent to improve hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these studies, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) were analyzed together, resulting in response rates varying from 8% to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present multi-center study evaluated whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> is of clinical benefit in patients with RA who are transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect on transfusion frequency as well as on platelets and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was examined in 14 patients with RA [median age 67 years (55-72 years), male:female 9:5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four treatment cycles were planned, each consisting of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> at 200 mg/m2/day three times per week followed by a 2-week interval </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients (21%), reduced transfusion requirement with prolongation of the transfusion interval from 4 weeks to 8 weeks (two patients) and 4 weeks to 6 weeks was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in ANC from 400/microliter to 2600/microliter and 200/microliter to 3400/microliter was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF alpha levels were increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (18.8 pg/ml vs 9.1 pg/ml), and there was no change during the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> (17.5 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> as a single agent was of limited benefit in patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The serum TNF alpha levels were unchanged during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> in RA patients </plain></SENT>
