<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-based GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients developed a maximum of grade IV, five grade III and two grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, with 15 patients being refractory to steroids and five dependent on steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with ATGAM (15 mg/kg for 5 d) and tacrolimus (0.025--0.1 mg/kg/d) in addition to continuation of their high-dose steroids and cessation of their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 28 d of treatment, we observed eight complete responses (CR), six partial responses (PR) and six with no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall response (CR + PR) was predicted by GVHD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infectious complications occurred in 80% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 86.5 d (range, 21--1081 d) with 35% of patients remaining alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival following combination therapy was significantly more likely in men (P &lt; 0.001), skin-only GVHD (P = 0.027), less severe GVHD (P = 0.048), and in responders to tacrolimus and ATGAM (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, concurrent introduction of ATGAM and tacrolimus is a promising therapeutic combination for GVHD refractory to steroids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
