<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The courses were repeated monthly until response or progression, in the case of response, the therapy was administered until relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in nine, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) in nine, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) in four patients; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, bone-marrow blast infiltration was greater than 10% (median 20%, range 12-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the international prognostic scoring system was applied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases qualified as intermediate/high-risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were males and three were females; the median age was 69 years (range 25-90 years); three patients had previously been treated with conventional chemotherapy, and one of them had also undergone autologous bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The criteria of response were defined as follows: (1) complete response: normalization of blood counts and bone-marrow blasts (&lt;5%), and (2) partial response: decrease in bone-marrow blast infiltration by 50%, and two of the following parameters - improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level by 1.5 g/dl or decrease by 50% in transfusional requirement, increase by 50% in absolute neutrophil count, and increase by 50% in platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 7 (32%) of 22 patients achieved a response, with 5 (23%) being classified as complete responders and 2 (9%) as partial responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (68%) patients did not achieve any response, and 14 died of progressive disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 8 months (range 1-27 months), whereas the median survival of responders was 16 months (range 8-27 months); the median duration of response was 11 months (range 2-21 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe hematological toxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the most common side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it seems that the association of ATRA and LDARA-C may be effective in approximately 30% of HRMDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Optimizing this approach might be pursued by selecting, on a biological basis, those cases more likely to respond or by incorporating other differentiating agents or growth factors </plain></SENT>
