<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormalities involving chromosome 7 are frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and suggest a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined the hypothesis that the clinical features and survival associated with isolated deletion (del) of part of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are different from those associated with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (complete loss of chromosome 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 133 patients with a diagnosis of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (according to the World Health Organization [WHO] classification) and chromosome 7 abnormalities in the Spanish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registry were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four karyotypic groups were identified: isolated del(7q) (n = 29), isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (n = 27), del(7q) with additional abnormalities (n = 24), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 with additional abnormalities (n = 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isolated del(7q) was more frequent in patients with less advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to the WHO classification or the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, isolated del(7q) was associated with fewer blasts in bone marrow than other cytogenetics groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly superior in patients with isolated del(7) than in those with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, del(7q) with additional abnormalities, or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 with additional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age, the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, and other chromosome 7 abnormalities apart from isolated del(7q) were identified as independent risk factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated del(7q) had some distinct clinical-pathologic characteristics as well as better survival than patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
