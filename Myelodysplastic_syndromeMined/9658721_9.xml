<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the surface expression of CD117 antigen in 135 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in relationship to de novo or secondary origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, subtypes of FAB classification, expression of other antigens such as CD34, HLA-DR, CD15, CD14, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD11b, CD11c, CD4, CD7, mixed antigen co-expression (LyAg + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and MyAg + ALL) and features of leukemic mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The CD117 antigen expression (clone 95C3) was determined by flow cytometry in a series of 135 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis consecutively observed during the years 1995-1997: 82 AML (including 51 cases of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 22 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 9 cases of myeloid blastic crisis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (BC-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 53 ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were stratified in CD117+ and CD117- groups and the differences were analyzed by using appropriate statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD117 antigen was found over 10% in 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without significant differences of positivity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or BC-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not note a significant correlation between FAB classification and CD117 which was expressed in 100% of M1 and M7 cases, in 80% of M0 cases, in 75% of M2 cases, in 70% of M3 cases and in 82% of M4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, in M5 subtype CD117 was strictly restricted to earlier stages: ten of the eleven M5b (91%) cases completely lacked CD117 antigen expression, whereas 100% of M5a cases were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of Pearson's coefficient showed: 1) a significant inverse relationship between CD117 and CD15, CD4 and CD14 (only in M5 subtypes) and CD11b, CD11c and CD45RO (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases); 2) a significant direct correlation between CD117 and CD34 and CD45RA (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases); and 3) an independent expression between CD117 and CD15 associated with a low correlation between CD117 and HLA-DR antigen (only in non-monocytic cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ALL, whether of B or T lineages, surface expression of CD117 was never observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the CD117 antigen shows a high specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, independently upon FAB classification, and represents a reliable marker in characterizing the differentiative degree of the monocytic blasts </plain></SENT>
