<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of leukemic transformation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with a sole chromosome abnormality of del11(p11-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had been diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in May 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time, cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient received sequential chemotherapy with low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (AraC) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was obtained with this treatment, but the disease gradually progressed after June 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetical analysis showed del11(p11-13) in 6 of 40 cells analyzed at that time, and the disease had evoluted to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in December 1999 with a gradual increase in the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of the WT1 gene located at chromosome 11p13 was overexpressed during leukemic transformation, whereas it was not detected at the time of the initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in May 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was thought that this chromosome deletion and overexpression of WT1 resulted in the leukemic transformation in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report of del11(p11-13) being considered to be the primary cause of leukemic transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
