<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here a patient who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, hypercellular bone marrow and three-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with an increase of reticulin fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a 5-month period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> progressed very rapidly and the white blood count increased showing 45% blasts with monocytoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but cytochemically undifferentiated in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype revealed an unusual expression of CD4, CD36 and HLA-DR in the absence of any other myeloid or lymphoid lineage-associated markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient died unexpectedly during the course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of CD4, CD36 and HLA-DR on the blast cells cannot determine the lineage of differentiation with certainty but provides some evidence that the leukaemic cells were probably derived from a very early monocytic progenitor with maturation arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells had apparently complex interactions with pathologic megakaryocytes and cytokine production </plain></SENT>
