<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations introduce premature stop codons, which result in truncation of 82-98 COOH-terminal amino acids of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> patients who develop secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> almost invariably acquired a GCSFR mutation, suggesting that this genetic alteration represents a key step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that an equivalent mutation targeted in mice (gcsfr-Delta715) results in the selective expansion of the G-CSF- responsive progenitor (G-CFC) compartment in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vivo treatment of gcsfr-Delta715 mice with G-CSF results in increased production of neutrophils leading to a sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hyperproliferative response to G-CSF is accompanied by prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) complexes and extended cell surface expression of mutant receptors due to defective internalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In view of the continuous G-CSF treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> patients, these data provide insight into why progenitor cells expressing truncated receptors clonally expand in vivo, and why these cells may be targets for additional genetic events leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
