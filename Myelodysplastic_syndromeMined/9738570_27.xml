<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To help fill the gap in knowledge about the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from repetitive high-dose use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase-II inhibitors</z:chebi> in young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> were treated with four courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (4,200 mg/m2)/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (75 mg/m2), and three courses of ifosfamide (9,000 mg/m2)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (500 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was calculated using the method of competing risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expected number of leukemic events was calculated by applying national incidence rates to person-years classified by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 86 patients (median age, 17 years) monitored for 6 to 88 months (median, 24), five cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were detected at 10 to 37 months (median, 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expected number of leukemic events in this cohort was .001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and cytogenetic findings implicated prior alkylator therapy in three cases and prior treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase-II inhibitors</z:chebi> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 40 months, the cumulative incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 8% (SE 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repetitive high-dose use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> given with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase-II inhibitors</z:chebi> is strongly leukemogenic, even with modest cumulative doses of each drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding is notable for the following reasons: (1) it undermines predictions that limited use of high-dose chemotherapy might be minimally leukemogenic, and (2) it contrasts strikingly with the previously reported low risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric solid tumors</z:e> with chemotherapy lacking the alkylator dose-intensity and prominence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> that are hallmarks of current regimens </plain></SENT>
