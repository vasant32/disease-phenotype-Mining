<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A modified and greatly shortened procedure for immunohistochemical localization of TGF-B using a monoclonal antibody was undertaken in plastic embedded bone marrow biopsy sections that demonstrated excellent preservation of morphologic detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a double-label procedure was developed for the simultaneous detection of TGF-B and cells actively engaged in DNA-synthesis which were labeled in vivo by infusing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked variation in intensity of TGF-B staining in interstitial areas of biopsies was noted among different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGF-B was also conspicuously present in the basement membrane of blood vessel endothelial cells and the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling revealed that S-phase cells in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases appeared clustered together and that megakaryocytes in S-phase were completely devoid of TGF-B </plain></SENT>
