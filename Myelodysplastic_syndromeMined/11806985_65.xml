<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To improve the prognostic assessment of clinical outcome, the associations of patient and disease characteristics with survival times of 213 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> was investigated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
