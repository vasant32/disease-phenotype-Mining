<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the efficacy of allogeneic HCT in patients in whom both myeloid and lymphoid disorders are present at the time of HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the outcomes in 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and concurrent lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> when undergoing allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients had previously received extensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, including autologous HCT in 7, for non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL, n=7), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, n=2), CLL (n=5), NHL plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n=1) or T-cell ALL (n=1), and had presumably developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as a consequence of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four previously untreated patients had CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 patients were conditioned with high-dose (n=14) or reduced-intensity regimens (n=5), and were transplanted from HLA-matched or one Ag/allele mismatched related (n=10) or unrelated (n=9) donors; two patients received HLA-haploidentical related transplants, following a modified conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, 2 of 4 previously untreated and 2 of 17 previously treated patients are surviving in remission of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the high non-relapse mortality among previously treated patients, even with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, indicates that new transplant strategies need to be developed </plain></SENT>
