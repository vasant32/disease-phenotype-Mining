<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the frequencies of genotypes for MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 Arg72Pro did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and healthy controls and that these polymorphisms were not associated with clinical and laboratory parameters, disease progression and overall survival, suggesting that MDM2 and TP53 polymorphisms are not involved in risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, or in the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the disease </plain></SENT>
