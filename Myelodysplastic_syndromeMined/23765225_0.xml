<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is the most frequent symptom of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the aim of this study was to identify markers of dyserythropoiesis relevant for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, analyzed by selecting erythroblasts in a whole no-lysis bone marrow strategy by using a nuclear dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study included 163 patients, including 126 with cytopenias leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suspicion and 46 controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a 'learning cohort' of 53 unequivocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with specific markers, there was a significant difference between the coefficients of variation of mean fluorescence intensities of CD71 and CD36 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two parameters and the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level were used to build a 'RED-score' strongly suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> ifâ‰¥3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the 'RED-score' in the whole cohort, 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or non <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When combined with the flow-score described by Ogata, this strategy allowed to reach a very high sensitivity of 88% of patients correctly classified.<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> accepted article preview online, 14 June 2013; doi:10.1038/leu.2013.178 </plain></SENT>
