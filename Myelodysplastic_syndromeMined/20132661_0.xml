<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> gene (WT1) expression levels measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was useful as an indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measure levels of WT1 expression, in order to find a possible association between the expression of this gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If an association was found, the WT1 gene could be evaluated as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> marker by comparison with other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated peripheral blood WT1 expression level measured by real-time light cycler quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 50 newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WT1 gene copy number was found to be &lt;23/microl cDNA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> were found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WT1-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On this basis WT1 expression analyses is unlikely to be a useful genetic marker for routine clinical use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
