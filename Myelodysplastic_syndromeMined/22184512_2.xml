<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterized by dysplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the bone marrow in association with ineffective hematopoiesis, pathophysiological causes of this disease are diverse including genetic abnormalities within myeloid progenitors, altered epigenetics, and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concept that T-cell mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> has been widely accepted due to hematologic improvement after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, IST for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> primarily involves anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-based regimens in which responsiveness is strongly associated with younger (under 60 years) age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such cases, progressive cytopenia may occur as a consequence of expanded self-reactive CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that suppress hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although most hematologists agree that IST can offer durable hematologic remission in younger patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, an international clinical study and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to the expansion of self-reactive CTLs is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, data accumulated in the US, Europe, and Asia will be summarized to provide insight and direction for a multi-center international trial </plain></SENT>
