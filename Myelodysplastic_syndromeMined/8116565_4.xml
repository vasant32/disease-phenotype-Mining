<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and the abnormalities of erythropoiesis in the group of HIV patients were less pronounced than in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; megakaryopoiesis showed similarities only with the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>, and characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Granulopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed an increase of blasts in several cases; this was not found in any biopsy specimen from the HIV group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a statistically significant increase of monocyte-like cells and giant bands could be observed in the bone marrow of the HIV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood findings and bone marrow picture in the series of our HIV patients appeared to be related mainly to the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e>, although a direct effect of the HIV itself could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
