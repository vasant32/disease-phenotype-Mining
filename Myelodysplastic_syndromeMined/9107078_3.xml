<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) showing high numbers of abnormally localized immature precursors (ALIP) also display myelomonocytic antigens on immature cells, and it has been suggested that the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> could define a distinct subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> characterized by poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to analysis the incidence and significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> among our series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and correlate the distributions of these elements with other hematologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the monocytic component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in order to clarify the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its relationship with CMMoL and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>Monocytosis</z:mp> was defined as a percentage of blood monocytes greater than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a series of 139 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, we describe a group of 29 (20.8%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> and dysplastic features involving multiple cell lineages which do not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CMMoL or aCML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients, who do not differ from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> in the main clinical parameters, are characterized by relatively higher leukocyte (WBC 6.6 x 10(9)/L) and granulocyte counts (PMN 2.5 x 10(9)/L), hypercellular bone marrow and relatively poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, we observed a particularly high incidence of evolution to CMMoL (34.5%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (17.2%) with monocytic component (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023479" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="AMML">FAB M4</z:e> and M5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data demonstrated clonal chromosome changes in 11/13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, while only 19/41 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> showed clonal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The combination of hematologic and cytogenetic features in our study suggests that it is reasonable to consider <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> as a distinct disease subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, characterized by multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> along with a higher incidence of karyotype aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multi-step pathogenetic process in these patients may have reached a more advanced stage at which the relative or absolute increase in the number of monocytes may represent the first event in the subsequent progression of the disease towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
