<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were extracted from 36 MDS patients and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of phosphorylated STAT5(P-STAT5) in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-)cells, with or without the stimulation of 10 U/ml EPO, were examined by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Without stimulation, the P-STAT5 MFI in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells of low/high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was 113.71 ± 67.22/173.05 ± 102.78, which was significantly higher than that of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (58.84 ± 27.51/68.99 ± 50.42, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (63.06 ± 21.06, P &lt; 0.05), there was no significant difference between the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells; With the EPO stimulation, the P-STAT5 MFI in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells of low/high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was 144.04 ± 58.11/239.45 ± 152.05, which was significantly higher than that of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (68.41 ± 25, 10/64.21 ± 23.43, P &lt; 0.01) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (75.21 ± 27.02, P &lt; 0.01), there was no significant difference between the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells; The P-STAT5 MFI in the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells of low/high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with or without EPO stimulation were 21.80/28.86, which was significantly higher than that of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (7.42/5.50, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells (6.39, P &lt; 0.05), there was no significant difference between the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(-) cells; There was no significant difference of P-STAT5 MFI with or without EPO stimulation and the increased P-STAT5 MFI between the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells of low and high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
