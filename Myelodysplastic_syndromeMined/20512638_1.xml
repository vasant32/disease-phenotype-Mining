<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is strongly associated with a well known or covert <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoral MS scarcely occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An unusual case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, which was diagnosed by mandibular MS that was developed in the alveolar socket after a dental extraction, is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological examination (including immunohistochemical analysis) of a subsequent biopsy showed infiltration of the oral mucosa by neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This lesion was therefore classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was referred to oncologists that confirmed the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent chemotherapy and the mandibular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty days later, a relapse of the disease, which appeared as a great-ulcerated lesion, was developed in the hard palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty days after the second chemotherapy had finished, a new intraoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was developed in the vestibular maxillary gingiva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature shows no report of intraoral relapse and particularly multiple relapse of a MS that involves the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though MS is encountered infrequently in the oral cavity, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conditions (especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) with a similar clinical appearance </plain></SENT>
