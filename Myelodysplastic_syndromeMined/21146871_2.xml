<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical and hematologic data of 231 patients diagnosed with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), identified cytogenetic characteristics, and evaluated the significance of prognostic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 51 years and the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes demonstrated a markedly low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with deletion 5q (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportions of World Health Organization (WHO) categories differed according to patient age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>Refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-2 demonstrated the most significant trend toward increased frequency with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of abnormal karyotypes in our study was comparable to a previous study (50.2%), although with different patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cytogenetic abnormality was +8 (34.5% of patients with abnormality), followed by 1q+ (17.2%), 5q- (15.5%), and 20q- (12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Majority of +8, 1q+, -5/5q- and -7/7q- cases combined with additional cytogenetic abnormalities (60.0%, 75.0%, 88.5% and 100%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 49.5 months and 13.8% patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and age group were significant factors associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, International Prognostic Scoring System was not included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated the different cytogenetic features in Korean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to those of Western country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, WPSS and age group are applicable to our patients as an effective and reliable prognostic model </plain></SENT>
