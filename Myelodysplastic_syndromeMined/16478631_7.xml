<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase I study of Triapine in combination with ara-C was conducted in 32 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Triapine (105 mg/m2/day 6-h infusion) was followed immediately by ara-C [100 (n=4), 200 (n=6), 400 (n=7), or 800 (n=8)mg/m2/day] as an 18-h infusion for 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 800 mg/m2 ara-C dose level (one patient each with grade 4 mucositis; grade 4 neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>; grade 4 neuropathy; and grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the study was amended to include an ara-C dose level of 600 mg/m2/day, no DLTs occurred in seven patients treated at this dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean Triapine C(max) and AUC were 1.13 microg/mL and 251.5 minmicrog/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 31 evaluable patients, 4 (13%) (3 AML, 1 Ph+ALL) achieved a CR (1 at a dose of 800 mg/m2; 2 at 600 mg/m2; 1 at 200mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recommended phase II regimen is Triapine 105 mg/m2/day followed by ara-C 600 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 3-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
