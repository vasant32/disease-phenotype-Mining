<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After in vitro administration a consistent group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may respond to GF but the possibility of differentiation, regulation or expansion of myelodisplastic clones following GF therapy is still a question to be answered as their optimum dose and combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To validate if in vivo treatment with GF, may promote the regulation or the recovery of myelopoiesis and/or modify the clonality of the responses, we gave G-CSF after intensive chemotherapy in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolving from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to our data the use of G-CSF after intensive chemotherapy may improve the CR rate without increase of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However the answer were clonal and the remission duration remained very short so we suggest to utilize this time to perform other therapeutic strategies such as, when possible, the BMT </plain></SENT>
