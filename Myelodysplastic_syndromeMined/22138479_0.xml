<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MDSs are characterized by several recurrent cytogenetic defects, which can affect diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of that chromosomal alterations are associated with very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics cannot accurately define the rearranged karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead, molecular cytogenetics analyses can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information for patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, allowing the characterization of the whole mutational spectrum and, mainly, novel chromosomal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> case with a novel chromosomal translocation [t(17;22)(q12;q22)], described for the first time here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following Giemsa-banding karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, by using chromosome-specific probes, displayed the breakpoint regions at chromosomes 17 and 22, within which intra and inter-chromosomal segmental duplications (SD) are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the occurrence of SDs in breakpoint region, it was not possible to finely define the genomic regions where breaks fell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations could be required to better understand the molecular basis of the novel translocation t(17;22)(q12;q12) acting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> context and to explain if SDs could contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
