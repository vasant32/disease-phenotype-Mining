<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rearrangements of the EVI-1 locus in chromosome band 3q26 are associated with a poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To aid the diagnosis of such aberrations, and possibly disease monitoring, we established an interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the affected breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Several overlapping PAC (P1-derived artificial chromosome) clones centromeric to the EVI-1 gene were labeled with a red <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, and PAC clones telomeric to EVI-1 with a green <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dual-color probe was hybridized to cytogenetic preparations of cell lines and patients' samples, which were also investigated for the presence of 3q26 rearrangements by chromosome banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nuclei without 3q26 rearrangements, two pairs of co-localized red and green signals were observed, while separation of one red/green signal pair or splitting of one red or one green signal was found when 3q26 aberrations were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The threshold value for true positivity, as determined on 20 samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> without 3q26 rearrangements, was 10.2% for separation of one red/green signal pair, and 1% and 1.3% for splitting of one red or one green signal, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17 samples from patients with a 3q26 aberration, the percentage of aberrant cells was significantly above these threshold levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We established an interphase FISH assay that efficiently identifies chromosome breakpoints affecting the EVI-1 locus in 3q26, and represents a useful complement to chromosome banding analysis for the detection of such aberrations </plain></SENT>
