<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In our clinical studies involving cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, starting cells came from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients and donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we study the feasibility of expansion and analyzed the characteristics of the end product from starting cells derived from different sources and at different <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five clinical scale cultures were grown from 28 patients and 20 donors in Good Manufacturing Practices facilities under CIK condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CIK cells could be successfully expanded from healthy donors, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> recovering from chemotherapy, untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with circulating leukemic blasts, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CIK cells of donor origin could be expanded from leukapheresis product collected from patients who relapsed post-allogeneic transplantation, thereby offering a useful method of obtaining activated donor cells in patients for whom further donor cells were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CIK cells cultured from patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> had a significantly higher proportion of CD3(+)CD56(+) subset and higher fold expansion of CD3(+) cells as compared to other groups of patients or healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that fresh starting cells expanded better than frozen-thawed cells, while prior exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> before harvesting did not adversely affect CIK cell expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical scale expansion of CIK cells is feasible from both healthy donors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients at various stages of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This robust system allows clinical translation using CIK cells as immunotherapy in various clinical settings </plain></SENT>
