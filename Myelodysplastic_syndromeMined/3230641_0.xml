<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He thus was treated solely with blood transfusions until June, 1986, when a new diagnosis revealed that his illness had been transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (M2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis at the initial diagnosis had revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the subsequent diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was made, however, a chromosomal abnormality [46, XY, -20, +der (20) t (?8;20) (q22;p13)] was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in patients evidencing a karyotypic alteration from the initial karyotypic findings progresses in severity that includes overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and results in a shorter survival than in patients who show no further karyotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be predicted more accurately by subsequently reanalyzing their chromosomes after the initial analysis, as well as by examining their peripheral blood/counts, and by monitoring bone marrow cytology </plain></SENT>
