<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before the approval of hypomethylating agents in this indication, the GFM conducted a multicenter phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerance of bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with excess of marrow blasts and its impact on bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were enrolled (16 males and five females) with a median age of 70 years and 19 were evaluable for haematological response after treatment (5 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks for 12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WHO diagnosis at baseline was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> (38%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated and was associated with significant decrease of VEGF plasma level [median (low quartile-high quartile)] from 65.5 pg/ml [LQ (low-quartile)-HQ (high quartile), 35.3-87.3 to 30.4 pg/ml (LQ-HQ, 22.5-34.0 pg/ml)] (p &lt; 0.01) and reduction of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> from a median of 20 vessels/mm(3) (LQ-HQ, 16.5-33 vessels/mm(3)) to 15.5 vessels/mm(3) (LQ-HQ, 10-23.2 vessels/mm(3)) (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only one patient had a significant haematological response with achievement of RBC transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, although bevacizumab had a significant impact on VEGF levels and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in our patients, very few responses were seen when this drug was used as single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given its good tolerability profile, however, combination of bevacizumab with other drugs, especially hypomethylating agents, could be considered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
