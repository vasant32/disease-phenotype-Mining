<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous study on the gene expression profile of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using microarray discovered that transcription of RAP1GAP was up-regulated, which was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in expanding cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was pourposed to investigate the expression of RAP1GAP in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of RAP1GAP in bone marrow cells of 19 MDS patients was detected by flow cytometry and was compared with that in patients with non-malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, meanwhile the relevance between expression level of RAP1GAP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, leukocytes, platelets, blasts percentage in bone marrow cells and IPSS score was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the expression level of RAP1GAp in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients significantly increased as compared with patients with non-malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (8.42 +/- 8.37% vs 2.97 +/- 4.75% or 2.26 +/- 4.24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the expression level of RAP1GAP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA was significantly higher than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (11.64 +/- 9.07% vs 4.37 +/- 4.65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no definitive correlation of expression level with above-mentioned clinical parameters was found in detected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the expression of RAP1GAP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients obviously increases, the relationship between expression level of RAP1GAP and laboratory hematological parameter and IPSS score does not be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role played by RAP1GAP expression in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its clinical significance during progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> deserves further studies </plain></SENT>
