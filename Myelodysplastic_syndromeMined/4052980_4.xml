<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observation confirms the occurrence of this characteristic chromosome anomaly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its possible induction by environmental agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that this t(1;7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may not be confined to a particular geographical area but that, in the past, it may have been overlooked in the absence of optimal banding, which is obviously necessary to identify the anomaly </plain></SENT>
