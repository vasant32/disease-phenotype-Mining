<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of MSI and promoter hypermethylation of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes in 82 patients (68 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve separate microsatellite loci, including three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeat markers, were used </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The promoter hypermethylation was found in three hMLH1 (3.7%) and two hMSH2 (2.4%) genes </plain></SENT>
