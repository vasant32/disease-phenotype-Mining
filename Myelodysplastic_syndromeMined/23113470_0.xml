<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While 2-yr disease-free survival (DFS) of patients who transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 12) was 25%, that of the remaining patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to response to HMA was 73.1%, 68.1%, 50.0%, and 20.8% in G-COR (group of continuous response, n = 19), G-NoC (group of no change, n = 15), G-LOR (group of loss of response, n = 6), and G-DP (group of disease progression, n = 4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When dichotomized as G-COR/G-NoC versus G-LOR/G-DP, significantly different 2-yr DFS (71.0% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.004) and relapse (14.1% vs. 46.7%; P = 0.016) were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, G-LOR/G-DP [hazard ratio (HR), 3.91; P = 0.008] and poor karyotype at transplantation (HR, 2.69; P = 0.017) were the significant predictors for poor DFS, as G-LOR/G-DP was for relapse (HR, 6.28; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DFS was significantly poor in patients with any of the two predictors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (81.5% vs. 34.9%; P = 0.001) or higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (HrMDS) at the time of HMA (80.7% vs. 29.2%; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-COR showed a trend of better DFS compared with G-NoC among HrMDS (74.6% vs. 36.5%; P = 0.090) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results implicate the significance of response to HMA on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcomes and support the need for future study to verify the suggested strategy of proceeding to transplantation before LOR or DP, especially for HrMDS </plain></SENT>
