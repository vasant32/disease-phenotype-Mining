<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MDSs are responsible for 1 or several peripheral cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evidence accumulated in recent years demonstrates that in addition to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> defects, a particular role is also played by stromal microenvironment dysfunctions, which mediate the direct contact with hematopoietic precursor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These interactions help regulate different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-related processes, such as progenitor cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, clonogenic growth, and maintenance in in vitro cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, these interactions are responsible for altering the microenvironment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present a novel selection protocol for obtaining a standards-compliant mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method allowed us to comparatively analyze 2 subpopulations of bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) in terms of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> profiles and growth abilities: BM-MSCs selected from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> settings and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional assays revealed that the MSCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are intrinsically pathological, thus showing a continuous decline of proliferation and a reduced clonogenic capacity during 14 days of culture and in the absence of signals from hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MSC growth defects were significantly correlated with decreases in CD44 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and CD49e (Î±5-integrin) </plain></SENT>
