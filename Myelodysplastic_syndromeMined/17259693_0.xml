<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the major changes suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification with respect to the French-American-British (FAB) proposal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was to lower the bone marrow (BM) blast count from 30 to 20%, thus eliminating the refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a general consensus has not been reached, and several authors still retain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> sub-entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We re-evaluated our series of 74 patients classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t according to the FAB criteria by stratifying them into two subsets: patients with at least 5% peripheral blast (PB) cells but with BM blasts &lt;20% (group I) and patients with BM blastosis between 20 and 30% and PBs &lt;5% (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found differences among the two groups regarding sex, haematological parameters at presentation (white blood cell and neutrophil counts, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level) and frequency of infectious episodes during the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences as to the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> transformation, but a significant difference was evidenced as to survival (9.3 vs. 16 months in group I vs. group II, respectively; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, at our institution, we compared the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t group I patients who, based on &gt;5% PBs, should be included in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> category according to the WHO criteria, with a group of 98 patients who were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> according to the WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings showed that the aggregation of these two subsets appeared inappropriate, because patients of the two groups showed different clinical features and rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t entity according to the FAB criteria, although including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical patient subsets, should more likely be considered as an advanced stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, rather than a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
