<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is well known that VK2 induces differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cell lines, little is known about its effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of VK2 on primary myeloid and erythroid progenitors were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mobilized CD34-positive cells from peripheral blood were used for the examination of myeloid lineage cells, and erythroid progenitors purified from peripheral blood were used for erythroid lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VK2 upregulated the expressions of myeloid markers CD11b and CD14, and increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and PU.1 in myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In erythroid progenitors, VK2 did not show a significant effect on differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, VK2 exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect on erythroid progenitors under erythropoietin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This anti-apoptotic effect was restricted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid progenitors and was not shown in erythroleukemic cell line AS-E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steroid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> receptor (SXR), which was recently identified as a receptor of VK2, was expressed on myeloid progenitors, and the SXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi> (RIF) also upregulated CD11b and CD14 expressions on myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SXR is involved in the effect of VK2 on myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major effect of VK2 on myeloid progenitors was promoting differentiation, whereas its anti-apoptotic effect seemed to be dominant in erythroid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the detailed mechanism of VK2's effect on differentiation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic progenitors remains unknown, the effect of VK2 therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be partly explained by these mechanisms </plain></SENT>
