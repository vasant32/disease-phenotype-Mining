<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of centriole duplication leads to supernumerary centrosomes, sister chromatid missegregation and could result in <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CIN is a common feature in at least 45 % of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to investigate the centrosomal status and its role for development of CIN in bone marrow (BM) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BM cells of 34 MDS patients were examined cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cells were immunostained with a centrosome-specific antibody to pericentrin to analyze the centrosomal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Umbilical cord blood specimens and BM cells of healthy persons (n = 11 and n = 4) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the protein expression of the protease separase responsible for genetic stability was examined by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Centrosome abnormalities were detected in 10 % (range, 4-17 %) of cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples, but in only 2 % (range, 0-4 %) of cells of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> karyotypes were found in control cells and in BM cells of 16/34 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of centrosomal alterations was higher in BM cells of patients with cytogenetic alterations (mean, 12 %) compared to BM cells of patients without cytogenetic changes (mean, 7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that centrosome alterations are a common and early detectable feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and may contribute to the acquisition of chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We assume that centrosome defects could be involved in disease progression and may serve as a future prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
