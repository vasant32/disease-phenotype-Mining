<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, radiological findings showed bilateral diffuse small nodular shadows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the results of an acid-fast bacilli examination of blood, sputum, and urine samples were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative, we initiated antituberculous therapy for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041321" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miliary tuberculosis</z:e> because the histological diagnosis from a bone marrow biopsy was epitheloid granuloma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities on his chest radiographs improved, but his left cervical lymph nodes became swollen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological result of a lymph node biopsy revealed epitheloid granuloma with caseating <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
