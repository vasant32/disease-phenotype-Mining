<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of GM-CSF, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the culture supernatants of BM macrophages was detectable only after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), whereas no differences were present in the amount of IL-6 and TNF-alpha between myelodysplastic patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, GM-CSF production appeared eight-fold reduced in BM macrophage culture supernatants from myelodysplastic patients with respect to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After further experiments, we concluded that the impaired release of GM-CSF by BM macrophages could not be due to a different production kinetic in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of multipotent (CFU-GEMM), granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors was significantly impaired in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the production of GM-CSF by purified adherent cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is markedly impaired in spite of the peripheral blood cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This selective defect in GM-CSF production, along with an intrinsic defect of haematopoietic progenitor cells, might contribute to the impairment of haematopoiesis always observed in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
