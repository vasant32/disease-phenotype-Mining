<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With recent advances in multi-color flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis, a CD34(+) progenitor-focused 7-color assay was developed and tested in this clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This assay was first performed in 73 MDS patients and 53 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (developmental set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of immunophenotypic changes were differentially observed in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, a core panel of markers was selected for final assessment that included increased total CD34(+) myeloblasts; decreased stage I hematogones; altered CD45/side scatter; altered expression of CD13, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD117, and CD123; aberrant expression of lymphoid or mature myelomonocytic antigens on CD34(+) myeloblasts; and several marked alterations in maturing myelomonocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were translated into a simplified scoring system which was then used in 120 patients with cytopenia(s) secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy over a 2-year period (validation set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 11 months, this assay demonstrated 89% sensitivity, 94% specificity, and 92% accuracy in establishing or excluding a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
