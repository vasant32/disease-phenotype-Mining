<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Isolated deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q), are observed in 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and are associated with a more favorable prognosis, although the clinical course varies considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If one or more additional chromosomal aberrations are present, this correlates with a significantly shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the frequency of hidden abnormalities in cases with an isolated cytogenetic del(5q), we have performed a genome wide high resolution 44 K 60mer oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) study using DNA from bone marrow cells of 12 MDS and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case a single additional hidden 5.6 Mb deletion of 13q14 and in another case multiple larger aberrations involving many chromosomes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that aberrations present in 35% of the bone marrow cells can be detected by aCGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore with oligonucleotide aCGH the deletion end points in 5q were mapped precisely, revealing a cluster of proximal breakpoints in band q14.3 (n = 8) and a distal cluster between bands q33.2 and q34 (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows the high resolution of oligonucleotide CGH arrays for precisely mapping genomic alterations and for refinement of deletion end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the high sensitivity of this method enables the study of whole bone marrow cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, a disease with a low blast count </plain></SENT>
