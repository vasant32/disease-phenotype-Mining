<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study identified 16 patients with RST over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proposed diagnostic criteria include a sustained platelet count &gt; 500 x 10(9)/l, &gt; or = 15% ringed sideroblasts, &lt; 3% bone marrow blasts, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 76 years with eight males and eight females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 41 months, RST patients had a median overall survival of 71 months, comparable with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> having ringed sideroblasts, but less favourable than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
