<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BAC probes encompassing the D11S29 and D11S924 markers and flanking the MLL gene were used in dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and cytogenetic abnormalities of 11q23 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BAC and MLL probes demonstrated split signals in five of 7 ALL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases with translocations of 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 2 cases, one had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> signals for both probe sets and the other had a submicroscopic deletion of the MLL 3' region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with del(11)(q23), deletion of the MLL 3' region and the region telomeric to the MLL gene was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three CLL cases with deletion of part or the entire 11q23 region showed deletion of one copy of MLL, but retention of the region telomeric to MLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with deletions involving the 11q23 region, deletions of both the MLL gene and the flanking regions of the MLL gene were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, the deletions on 11q23 are different but overlapping for CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, implicating different genes involved for these diseases </plain></SENT>
