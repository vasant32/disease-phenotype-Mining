<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 58 months in BMT recipients and 18 months in PBSCT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil (median, Day 8 vs Day 13, p &lt; 0.001) and platelet engraftment (median, Day 9 vs Day 17, p &lt; 0.001) was faster in the PBSCT group than in the BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving PBSCT required less platelet transfusion than those receiving BMT (median, 54 units vs 144 units, p &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference in red cell transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 100 days, there was no difference in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (42.9% vs 33.3%, p = 0.72) or grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (14.3% vs 5.6%, p = 0.57), and there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (20% vs 33.3%, p = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was noted in any relapsed patients (BMT, 5; PBSCT, 3), and no patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD during follow-up had a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse was the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inboth groups (BMT, 5/9, 55.6%; PBSCT, 3/4, 75%; p = 0.25); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relapses occurred within 1 year after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was significantly better in the PBSCT group (35.7% vs 77.8%, p = 0.029), but this difference was lost if only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> were analyzed (30.8% vs 63.6%, p = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results are similar to those reported previously, with faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment and less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD with PBSCT </plain></SENT>
