<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with non-M3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, median age 69 years (range 61-81), were accrued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (38%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine and ARA-C were administered as a continuous sequential infusion for 72 and 96 hours, respectively, after a loading dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving complete remission (CR) were intended to receive an additional course, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients (67%) achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 10 induction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (16%), while 11 patients were refractory (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those achieving a remission, 35 patients (83%) received the planned consolidation course and 29 underwent mobilization of CD34+ cells into the peripheral blood for collection, which was successful in 23 (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 17 patients (27% of the whole population) received ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall and disease-free survival were both 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an intermediate karyotype and those receiving ASCT had a significantly better clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results in terms of CR achievement, CD34+ cell collection and ASCT feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A longer follow up is needed in order to evaluate the actual benefit on long-term survival </plain></SENT>
