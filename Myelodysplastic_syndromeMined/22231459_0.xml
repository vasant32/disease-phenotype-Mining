<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HRQoL post transplantation was evaluated by an SF-36 questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of various factors on the HRQoL was analyzed through COX regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the ISD group, patients in the HID/PMRD group had higher scores in physical functioning, general health, bodily pain, vitality and emotional role functioning, and these patients functioned significantly better on the physical and mental component summaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, long-term survivors exhibit better HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measured by multivariate analysis, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was observed to have a strongly negative impact on patients' HRQoL, while male gender status, lower age when receiving allo-HSCT and returning to work or school were associated with positive impacts on at least one subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the HRQoL of patients receiving HID/PMRD hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) is comparable to that of patients receiving ISD HSCT, and HLA disparity is not the factor affecting the HRQoL </plain></SENT>
