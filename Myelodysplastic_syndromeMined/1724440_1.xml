<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> percentage was quantitated by alkali denaturation of the hemolysate, and the gamma chain content was determined in blood hemolysate by HPLC following HbF isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 7/3 ratio of fetal Gy/Ay was found in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high HbF levels was longer than that of patients with low levels of HbF, this finding may be used as a potential prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
