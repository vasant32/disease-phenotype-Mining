<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, proteins with this type of membrane linkage are known to be deficient on blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of flow cytometric FcRIII quantification on granulocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence measurements were performed in 105 patients, including 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, by a whole blood immunofluorescent staining procedure using monoclonal antibodies to FcRIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 PNH patients and in 3 patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, a distinct FcRIII-deficient granulocyte population of variable size was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the remaining patients showed a similar population of FcRIII-deficient granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantification of FcRIII-deficient neutrophils is shown to be a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is easy, fast and highly reproducible and, therefore, suitable for routine diagnostic and follow-up studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
