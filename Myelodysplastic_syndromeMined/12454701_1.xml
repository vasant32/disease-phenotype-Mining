<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested two molecular markers in bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients: Galpha16, a hematopoiesis-specific G protein alpha subunit serving as an intracellular marker of hematopoietic activity, and 5'-lipoxygenase (5-LO), a putative differentiation marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with clinical and laboratory features and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cells were evaluated by block cycler PCR in 32 patients for Galpha16 and in 25 patients for 5-LO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients cDNA analyzed by the block cycler method was quantified by real-time quantitative (RTQ) PCR for both Galpha16 and 5-LO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed concordance of the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FAB and WHO subtypes were positive for at least one of the two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, only 1 of 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> was positive for Galpha16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation between Galpha16 or 5-LO and bone marrow cellularity or cytogenetic risk factors (IPSS) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only combined evaluation of Galpha16 and 5-LO expression showed a correlation with extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A relationship between the two markers and preleukemic duration was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that both Galpha16 and 5-LO can be expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, reflecting proliferation and differentiation processes in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different expression patterns of the two molecules indicate that proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells may occur independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These parameters could constitute a new class of risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Determination of Galpha16 and 5-LO expression may provide a tool for observing growth and maturation in these diseases </plain></SENT>
