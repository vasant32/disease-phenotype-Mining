<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are often older and may have contraindications to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens have shown encouraging results in higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term results with topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> versus other intensive chemotherapy regimens in higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred ten patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with intensive chemotherapy were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 63 years; 82% had intermediate 2 or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 32% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>; 40% had chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy was: topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in 77; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens in 270; topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in 67; fludarabine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in 96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent associations of different variables, and most important, the treatment regimen, with complete response, induction mortality, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall complete response (CR) rate was 55%, induction mortality 17%, and 5-year survival rate 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 11% for patients younger than 65 years old and 17% for patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 82 patients younger than 65 years with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, the CR rate was 67%, 5-year survival rate 27%, and 5-year CR duration rate 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens were equivalent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens in relation to CR rates and survival rates, but were associated with a lower induction mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that treatment regimens were not associated with independent significant differences in CR rates or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens were still selected to be associated with lower induction mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> regimens are equally effective to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> regimens in higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be less toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> may be considered a reasonable alternative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in older patients with contraindications to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
