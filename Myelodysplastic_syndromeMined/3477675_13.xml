<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be especially useful in the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e> as the MRI-signal from bone marrow is not influenced by the overlying osseous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The T1- and T2-relaxation processes were measured in the lumbar spine bone marrow using a wholebody superconductive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-scanner operating at 1.5 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients MRI was done at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up of chemotherapy and related to bone marrow biopsies taken within three days of the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis T1-relaxation time was increased two to three times in the patients (range 0.7-3.0 sec.) compared to the controls (range 0.38-0.60 sec.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in the T2-relaxation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In relation to chemotherapy T1 decreased towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the patients who obtained complete remission, whereas T1 remained prolonged in the patients who did not respond successfully to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that MRI may be a non-invasive clinically useful tool in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> especially as a follow-up control of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
