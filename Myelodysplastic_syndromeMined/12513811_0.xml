<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and cytogenetic karyotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Spectrum Green labeled chromosome 8 centromere probe, interphase FISH was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clones were simultaneously detected in 48 MDS cases with FISH and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the CCA revealed no significant difference of constitutional proportion between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> with karyotypes of whole +8, partial +8 and one +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With FISH, detectable rates were 66.1% for whole +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial +8 and sole +8 were significantly higher than one +8 and complex +8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 were similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 was detected in 1 of 15 specimens with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal karyotype without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was linear correlation between the percentages of partial +8 detected by FISH and CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients received CCA and FISH examination at diagnosis and during treatment, the percentage of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was increased with progress of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results showed that FISH is a sensitive and accurate technique to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can provide contribute to diagnosis, assessment of curative effect and predicting progress of disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clone size of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 does not related to classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but sole +8 is seems to see in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA frequently </plain></SENT>
