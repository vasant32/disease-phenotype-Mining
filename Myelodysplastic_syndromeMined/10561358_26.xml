<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with MDSs and 27 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were either previously untreated (66%) or had received only biologic agents (14%) or chemotherapy with or without biologic agents (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) by continuous intravenous infusion daily for 5 days and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>0 g/m(2) by infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis included antibacterial, antifungal, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 7 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 86 patients were assessable for response and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was observed in 48 patients (56%; 61% with MDSs, 44% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>; P =.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar CR rates were observed for patients with good-risk and poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (70% and 56%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment effectively induced CR in patients with a poor-prognosis karyotype involving chromosomes 5 and 7 (CR, 71%) and secondary MDSs (CR, 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients received one induction course, 25 patients received two, and the rest received more than two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median number of continuation courses was two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median overall duration of CR was 34 weeks (50 weeks for MDSs and 33 weeks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 60 weeks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 44 weeks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CR and survival durations were longer in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 mucositis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was observed in three patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> was observed in 63%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 49% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Six patients (7%) died during induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Topotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> induced high CR rates in unselected patients with MDSs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, particularly among patients with poor-prognosis cytogenetics and secondary MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Topotecan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is an active induction regimen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients, is well tolerated, and is associated with a low mortality rate </plain></SENT>
