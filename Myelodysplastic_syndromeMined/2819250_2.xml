<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An altered CFU-GM pattern was found in 64% of cases at diagnosis, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth was seen in the remaining cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were affected by refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of CFU-GM, as well as cellularity, were reduced in myelodysplastic marrows compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls over the whole duration of LTBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM level at diagnosis also showed pathological behaviour when examined in LTBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of dysplastic haematopoiesis was significantly shorter than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferative ability of CFU-F was reduced in 50% of cases as shown by replating experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, myelodysplastic marrow shows an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852552,C0233514" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">abnormal behaviour</z:e> in LTBMC, even in those cases which present <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM growth at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
