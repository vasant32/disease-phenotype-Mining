<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate for diagnoses of atomic bomb-related cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in Nagasaki was determined using the French-American-British (FAB) classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) hematologists and one of the members (JMB) of the FAB cooperative group reviewed independently the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow smears from 193 people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or a related disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was 85% agreement in the identification of types and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was almost complete agreement for the diagnoses of non-FAB disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ATL) and others) resulting in overall concordance of 88.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the previously established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> types for about a quarter of the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and related disorders except <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> should be changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable numbers of cases of ATL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were involved in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the former disease was not high in the high-dose irradiated group, but that of the latter was considerably high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> except M3 and M6 were present in the high-dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The striking difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> incidence between Nagasaki and Hiroshima may continue to be a problem in relation to biological response to radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
