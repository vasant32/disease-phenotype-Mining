<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 61 evaluable biopsies, 47 were 'genuine' aplastic, 11 intermediate and three hypoplastic MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory infiltrates were graded as III in 36/60 evaluable biopsies, as II in 21 and I in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A moderate to marked increase of mast cells was seen in 19/61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of grade III patients, 86% had a less than 90 d interval between diagnosis and administration of ATG, versus 50% of grade I/II patients (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other correlations with pretreatment characteristics were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant prognostic value for survival or response to ATG of any of these three criteria has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More patients with grade III <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> tended to show adequate recovery at 4 and 6 months after ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stem cell damage, not identifiable morphologically, and/or impairment of accessory cells might play a major role in eventual outcome of SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients are currently alive, median 3.8 years (up to 12.4) after ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up bone marrow aspirates and biopsies of 32 patients were evaluable and none showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient revealed persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 31, haematopoiesis was decreased in 14 and increased in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had dyserythropoiesis, 28 dysplastic myelopoiesis and in 16/29 with evaluable megakaryocytes, dysmegakaryopoiesis was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had normo- to hypercellular bone marrows with two dysplastic cell lines (consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) according to the FAB-group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of the dysplastic abnormalities found in these patients needs longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Close observation is indicated in view of the previously recognized, albeit uncommon, evolution of SAA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
