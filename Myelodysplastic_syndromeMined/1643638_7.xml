<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro colony growth was studied on bone marrow cells from 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), using a cell culture method with the unique feature of daily feeding, in an effort to gain insight into the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to assess the clinical utility of this cell culture assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The colony growth pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells is remarkably similar to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> but quite dissimilar from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, in support of a common pathophysiological mechanism for these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29073">L-ascorbic acid</z:chebi> (LAA) enhanced colony growth in 30% and suppressed growth in 16% of cases, a finding also similar to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, indicating a unique growth requirement which may be explored for therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, these LAA effects have prognostic value, with LAA-sensitive (both LAA-enhanced and LAA-suppressed) cases displaying shorter survivals than LAA-insensitive cases (median survival of 5 months versus 18 months; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prognostic value is independent of, and more powerful than, bone marrow blasts; the median survival was 18 months for less than 5% bone marrow blasts and 8 months for greater than 5% bone marrow blasts (P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two risk factors can be used together to identify patients with an extremely good or an extremely poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study establishes the clinical usefulness of the LAA effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as a prognostic factor and provides a new lead to explore in understanding differential biochemical/molecular events and, possibly, a new therapeutic approach to the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
