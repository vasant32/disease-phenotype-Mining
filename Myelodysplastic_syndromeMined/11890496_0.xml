<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A French university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients age 65 and older with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> made in the hospital between January 1993 and December 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Clinical presentation, initial hematological features, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (French American British classification), treatment, and evolution at 36 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the group was 78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was the initial hematological feature in 30 patients out of 45 and was symptomatic in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>Refractory anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 20 patients; 11 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast cells, eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients received erythrocyte transfusions, no patient received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 36 months, 68.8% of the patients were dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival (22 months) was lower than in other reported series even in types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with a classically better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> is probably underdiagnosed in older people and has a poor prognosis (median survival 22 months), and no effective treatment is available in older patients </plain></SENT>
