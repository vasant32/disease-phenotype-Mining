We report a pattern of partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> and unbalanced whole-arm translocations of 1q in 10 patients: 5 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, and a single patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and myeloproliferative syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 1q was registered as the sole karyotype aberration in one patient, while it was accompanied by a limited number of additional chromosomal changes in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients are a subset of a larger group of 92 adults carrying a wide variety of chromosome 1 anomalies within a complex cytogenetic context observed over a period between 1994 and 2006 in a panel of 3,786 hematologic patients at the Institute of Hematology in Belgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics was supplemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe specific for the paracentric region of 1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-arm 1q translocations involved chromosomes Y, 7, 14, 15, 16, and 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that gain of 1q as the sole cytogenetic abnormality may be sufficiently mutagenic to favor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> and hematopoietic tissue degeneration (trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
