<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the expression of p57kip2 in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) subsets by real-time quantitative PCR, as well as the relationship between p57kip2 and CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also searched the role of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signal in p57kip2 expression in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of p57kip2 decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases (low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, P&lt;0.001, n = 46; high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, P&lt;0.001, n = 21), compared with that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor karyotype (according to IPSS) had lower p57kip2 than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p57kip2 expression increased after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in the cases that had achieved response (P = 0.009, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a positive correlation between p57kip2 and CXCR4 was investigated (r = 0.652, P&lt;0.001, n = 67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p57kip2 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls increased significantly when co-cultured with SDF-1 in vitro, which could be blocked by AMD3100, whereas SDF-1 only induced a mild increase in p57kip2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low expression of p57kip2 is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced response to SDF-1 contributed to low expression of p57kip2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
