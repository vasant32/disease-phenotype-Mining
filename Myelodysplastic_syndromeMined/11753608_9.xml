<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alternative treatments, such as transplantation with other family donors, are an option for patients without HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated transplantation with genotypically nonidentical family donors and compared the results to those obtained with unrelated donors and autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall 3-year survival was 35% for the 79 patients transplanted using genotypically nonidentical donors, DFS was 31%, relapse risk 16%, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients transplanted using phenotypically identical family donors had a significantly superior survival and a lower TRM than patients transplanted with mismatched family donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age had no influence on the outcome of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DFS of patients transplanted in early stage of the disease was 42% compared to 28% in patients transplanted with more advanced disease (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of transplantation with mismatched family donors were comparable to those obtained with unrelated donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nonidentical family donors may be considered if a fully matched unrelated donor is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TRM of patients transplanted with nonidentical family donors is significantly higher than the TRM of patients transplanted with autologous stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival of ASCT is not inferior to allogeneic transplantation using nonidentical family donors, and the intensity of the treatment is much lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The choice of ASCT or alternative donor transplantation must be influenced by the age of the patient and the risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients under the age of 20 years the treatment of choice may indeed be an alternative donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
