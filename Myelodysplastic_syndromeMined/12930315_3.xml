<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CLAG) regimen in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in the multicenter phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C2 g/m2, and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the case of partial remission (PR), a second CLAG was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in complete remission (CR) received two consolidation courses based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> Ara-C, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> or idarubicine, with or without 2-CdA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients from 11 centers were registered; 50 primary resistant and eight early relapsed (CR1 &lt; 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR was achieved in 29 (50%) patients, 19 (33%) were refractory, and 10 (17%) died early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty of 50 primary resistant patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DNR) and Ara-C as the first-line induction therapy (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-7), 10 received additional 2-CdA (DAC-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CR rates after CLAG were 58% and 10%, respectively in each group (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS, 1 yr) for the 58 patients as a whole, and the 29 patients in CR were 42% and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS, 1 yr) was 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only first-line induction treatment with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-7 significantly influenced the probability of CR after CLAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the analyzed factors significantly influenced DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CLAG regimen has significant anti-leukemic activity and an acceptable toxicity in refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The addition of 2-CdA to the first-line induction treatment may worsen the results of salvage with CLAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The high CR rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> deserves further observation </plain></SENT>
