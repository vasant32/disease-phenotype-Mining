<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess whether topotecan with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>) should be studied in phase II trials in patients with refractory or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with refractory or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were assigned to one of 3 strata defined by expected CR rates of 7%, 20% and 40%, then randomly assigned to receive topotecan (dl-5) and ara-C (1 g/m2 over 2 hours; dl-5), topotecan (d1-5) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (250 mg/m2 twice daily, d6-7), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (250 mg/m2 twice daily dl-2) followed by topotecan (d3-d7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dose-finding phase was conducted in the poorest stratum of each arm (topotecan starting dose: 1.0 mg/m2/day x 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Bayesian pre-phase II selection design was used to assess whether the CR rate with a given arm was sufficient to merit investigation in phase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients, median age 58 years, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their median first CR duration was 28 weeks and 24% were primary refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 mucositis occurred in the initial patients in the topotecan --&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>, but not in the topotecan + ara-C or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> --&gt; topotecan arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in subsequent patients, the topotecan dose was lower in the topotecan --&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> than in the other 2 arms (1.0 vs 1.25 mg/m2 daily x 5) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> dose was lower in the topotecan --&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> arm (200 vs 250 mg/m2 twice daily x 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One CR occurred (topotecan --&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> arm), and the treatment arms were terminated after 10, 15, and 12 patients were treated on the topotecan + ara-C, topotecan --&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> --&gt; topotecan arms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The principal cause of failure was insufficient anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on study, and toxicity was minimal at the final doses used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that none of the combinations studied here warrants phase II evaluation in very poor prognosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> salvage patients </plain></SENT>
