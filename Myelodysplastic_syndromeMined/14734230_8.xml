<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow chromosome changes were present in both: <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> and tetrasomy 8 (with a pericentric inversion of one chromosome 8) in the older sister, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (with clones with additional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> 19 and 21) in the younger one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular data were obtained on the parental chromosome involved in these numerical anomalies, which proved to be of paternal origin in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observations of this family, and a review of familial cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), led us to consider that they may be divided into two groups: those which arise on the basis of a Mendelian predisposing disorder exerting a mutator effect, often with the acquisition of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and those in which no specific Mendelian predisposing disease is recognized, as the familial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 cases and the one reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We postulate that in these families an inherited mutator effect is present and that it causes a karyotype instability, which leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, often through the acquisition of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
