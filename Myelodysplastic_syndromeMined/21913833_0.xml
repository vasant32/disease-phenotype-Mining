<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied antigen-expression profiles of blasts/dendritic cells (DCs) generated from 137 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/49 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with six different DC-generating media by flow-cytometry combining expression of blast/maturation and DC antigens (DCA:CD1a,b,c, CD25, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD137-L and CD206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, DCA are regularly and variably expressed on uncultured blasts/mononuclear cells (MNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual patients' DCA profiles must be evaluated before DC-culture to find suitable DCA to estimate quality/quantity of DC after culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, after culture in every patient, at least one marker fulfilled these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, different DC-generating methods showed varying efficiency to generate DC: not every method was always successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourth, individual FACS-DCA profiles showed a successful DC/DC(leu) generation with at least one of three previously tested methods in every given <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifth, pooling results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> selected best methods in every given case, 28/30% DC were generated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> samples: &gt;60% viable DC, on average 49/56% mature DC and on average 36% of blasts were convertible to DC(leu) resulting in on average 49% DC(leu) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individual DCA-expression profiles should be evaluated before culture to evaluate DC counts/subtypes (mature/viableDC, DC(leu)) in individual patients </plain></SENT>
