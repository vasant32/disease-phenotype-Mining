<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical importance of erythroid predominance in bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of diseases that historically have been classified into different categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 313 AML patients and specifically compared the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular features of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with erythroid predominance, arbitrarily defined as â‰¥50% erythroid precursors, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases without erythroid predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed 51 patients with a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were classified according to the World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, the presence of erythroid predominance in variously classified categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was associated with a survival advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with erythroid predominance had a lower frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as a lower frequency of mutations involving NPM1, NRAS and FLT3 as compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without erythroid predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with erythroid predominance in the non-therapy-related setting are much closer to those of a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> than they are to other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
