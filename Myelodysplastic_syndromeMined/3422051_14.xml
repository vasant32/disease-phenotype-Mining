<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sites of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were defined by comparison with the same karyotype treated G-banding, and a more precise analysis was performed using the image analyzer, Maziscan III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early phase DNA synthesis roughly coincided with R-bands and late phase DNA synthesis with G-bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> which developed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, had a 46,XY, t(4;11) (p12;p15) karyotype, and revealed an altered DNA replication time at the translocated site, 4p15, from the late to the early phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present method was useful in detecting an alteration of DNA replication timing according to chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
