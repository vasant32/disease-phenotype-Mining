<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current treatment paradigm, which is based on a relationship between complete remission (CR) and survival, is increasingly being questioned (Cheson (2006) Blood108 419) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of AZA-001 show CR is sufficient but not necessary to prolong OS (List (2008) Clin Oncol26 7006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the AZA CR rate in AZA-001 was modest (17%), while partial remission (PR, 12%) and haematological improvement (HI, 49%) were also predictive of prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis was conducted to assess the median number of AZA treatment cycles associated with achievement of first response, as measured by IWG 2000-defined CR, PR or HI (major + minor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of treatment cycles from first response to best response was also measured </plain></SENT>
