<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the status of Tregs in neoplastic and autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the technical aspects of Treg measurement in terms of sample type and detection markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 68 subjects were enrolled: 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 8 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and 39 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tregs were analyzed in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and the Human Regulatory T cell Staining Kit (eBioscience, USA) for CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 (forkhead box P3) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CD4+CD25(high)/CD4 and CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 populations were significantly correlated (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups had significantly larger CD4+CD25(high)/CD4 and CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 populations in PB than the autoimmune (P=0.007 and 0.012, respectively) and control groups (P=0.004 and 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparable findings were observed in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 population was significantly larger in PB than in BM (P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides comparison data for Tregs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e>, and would be helpful for understanding the different immunologic bases of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treg measurement using CD4, CD25, and/or FoxP3 in PB rather than in BM seems to be practical for routine hematologic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Large-scale analysis of the diagnostic role of Treg measurement is needed </plain></SENT>
