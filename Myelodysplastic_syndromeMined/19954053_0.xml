<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in cases diagnosed with WHO classification and evaluate the validity of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) so as to establish a new score system for Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and thirty-five patients diagnosed as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Sino-US <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Cooperative Group of Shanghai were studied prospectively to identify the prognostic factors by Log-rank test and Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year survival rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 46.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) subtype was 38 months and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) subtype was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and twenty-four patients have successful karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the IPSS score, low risk, intermediate risk- I, intermediate risk-II and high risk group accounted for 38/424 (9.0%), 282/424 (66.5%), 74/ 424 (17.5%) and 30/424 (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of Cox model showed old age, lower neutrophil absolute count (NAC), lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, lower platelet count and IPSS group were independent factors associated with overall survival time (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WPSS was not an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, platelet count, IPSS score, IPSS cytogenetics group and chromosome abnormality were not independent prognostic factors; whereas age (&gt; or = 60 years old), NAC (&lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/L), Hb (&lt; 90 g/L) and degree of cytopenia were independent factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A new score system was established based on these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It had better ability to predict OS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients as it was proved by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The survival rate and median survival time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Chinese are similar to those in Western </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IPSS score can predict prognosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and it is better than WPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, both of them have no validity for the prognostication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A new score system which can distinguish the different prognoses for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients is suggested </plain></SENT>
