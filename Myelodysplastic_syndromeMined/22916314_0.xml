<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence has been mounting that these entities are manifestations on a spectrum of the same disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present a patient who initially presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow biopsy was performed and she was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several months later, her persistent pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was biopsied revealing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019625" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rosai-Dorfman disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two years after her initial hospitalization, the patient presented with lesions consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">generalized eruptive histiocytomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case highlights the difficulty that clinicians encounter when trying to separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">generalized eruptive histiocytomas</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019625" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rosai-Dorfman disease</z:e>, and the other non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While further research needs to be performed in the field of histiocytoses, this case provides clinical support that these diseases are closely linked </plain></SENT>
