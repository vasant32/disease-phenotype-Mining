<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, molecular biomarkers to identify poor-risk patients are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated AF1q expression in the absence of specific poor cytogenetics is associated with poor outcomes in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined AF1q expression in 290 patients with NC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with low AF1q (n = 73) expression (AF1q(low)) have better OS (P = 0.026), disease-free survival (P = 0.1), and complete remission rate (P = 0.06) when compared with patients with high AF1q expression (AF1q(high) n = 217) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with AF1q(high) had significantly greater incidence of concurrent tyrosine kinase3 internal tandem duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of the patients with AF1q(high) who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) had a significant better relapse-free survival when compared with patients who received chemotherapy/autologous SCT (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that high AF1q expression is a poor prognostic marker for adult patients with NC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
