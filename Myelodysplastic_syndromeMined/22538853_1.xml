<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of ≥ 15% bone marrow (BM) ring sideroblasts (RS) and &lt; 5% blasts is required for a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the phenotypic and prognostic relevance of this "15%" RS threshold in 200 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) without excess blasts and with ≥ 1% RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of RS% was assessed both as a continuous and categorical variable: &lt; 5% (n = 56), 5%-14% (n = 32), 15%-50% (n = 79), and &gt; 50% (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RS% correlated (P &lt; .05) directly with age, platelet count, transfusion dependency, BM cellularity, and mutant SF3B1 and inversely with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and high-risk karyotype; but did not correlate with IDH mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 33 months, 156 (73%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 24 (12%) leukemic transformations were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither univariate nor multivariable analysis showed significant effect for RS% on overall or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival, suggesting the limited prognostic value of quantifying BM RS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
