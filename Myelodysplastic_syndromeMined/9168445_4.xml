<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in childhood is considered to be very rare and detailed pathobiological data are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More biological information regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in children is clearly needed and in vitro culture studies provide one possibility for gaining further pathophysiological insights into this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we incubated bone marrow samples from 30 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in liquid suspension culture in order to grow the transformed cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cultures, the hematopoietic cells died quickly and only fibroblastic (stromal) background layers proliferated temporarily; several <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in one instance, albeit from the peripheral blood and not from the bone marrow, could we establish a cell line, termed MUTZ-1, from the malignant cells of a 5-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (FAB subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> arose from a pre-existing Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and progressed quickly to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026999" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M2</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite positivity for EBV, MUTZ-1 is not an EBV + B-LCL and further characterization of MUTZ-1 confirmed the derivation from the transformed clonal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping showed a pre B-cell surface marker profile (CD10+ CD19+ cytoplasmic IgM+); receptor gene rearrangement analyses underlined the clonal B-cell nature of MUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUTZ-1 cells exhibit a highly rearranged, unstable karyotype with a high frequency of spontaneous chromatid breaks and exchanges; del(5q) and additional rearrangements involving chromosome 5 [der(15)t(5;15)] were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data and results from a few other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cell lines suggest that the transforming event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> seems to occur in an immature pluripotent progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived continuous cell line MUTZ-1 provides a useful in vitro model system for studies on the pathogenetic events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
