<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that prophylactic SDAP and PPC transfusions are clinically equivalent after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transfusions administered to 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> during the first 100 days after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-based, myeloablative HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> donor-recipient pairs were ABO identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfusion threshold was a platelet count &lt; or =15 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corrected increment (CCI) was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to platelet engraftment was 13 days (n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPC transfusions (n=105) were ABO compatible, while 10% of 41 SDAP were not (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median post-transfusion platelet count was 51K/microl (5-118K) after SDAP and 36K/microl (3-115K) after PPC (P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median CCI was 14.178 (SDAP) versus 7.793 (PPC) (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time to another transfusion was 3 days (SDAP) and 2 days (PPC; P=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the week following any given transfusion, the median number of new transfusions was similar (n=2), as well as the need of further transfusion (16 versus 24%, P=0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 17% of SDAP and 30% of PPC transfusions were labeled 'ineffective' (P=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were two non-lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> episodes (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SDAP transfusions produced better platelet counts, but SDAP and PPC were equally effective in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
