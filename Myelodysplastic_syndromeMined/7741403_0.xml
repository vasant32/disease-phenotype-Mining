<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied serum erythropoietin levels in patients with inflammatory process of varying aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum erythropoietin levels and reticulocyte counts were prospectively measured in 40 patients with inflammatory syndromes and compared with values obtained in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse correlation between erythropoietin levels and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration were noted in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The slope of the regression line for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> was lower as compared with that for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, when the erythropoietin response in relation to degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is compared with that which occurs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, the inadequate erythropoietin response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory process becomes evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with inflammatory process, a relationship between erythropoietin levels and reticulocyte counts were only noted in patients with mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration higher than 10.5 g/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests blunted erythropoietin production and impaired marrow response to this hormone in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> which occurs in inflammatory syndromes and supports the hypothesis that these disorders may contribute to the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
