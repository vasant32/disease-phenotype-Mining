<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) was obtained in 10 patients (66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five of them this was achieved after a single course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time to achieve a CR was 32 days (range 16-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A partial remission (PR) was obtained in 2 patients after two induction courses of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died during the first induction course following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) complication, whereas the chemotherapy regimen failed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median event free survival for patients who achieved CR was 15 months and the median actuarial survival 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results need to be confirmed in a multicentre prospective study comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
