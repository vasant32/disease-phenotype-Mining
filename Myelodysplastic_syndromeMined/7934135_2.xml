<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a Phase I-II trial of recombinant human erythropoietin-beta (rhEPO) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of rhEPO by subcutaneous injection thrice weekly for 6 weeks at one of three dose levels (100 U/kg (three patients), 200 U/kg (three patients) and 400 U/kg (14 patients)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ferrous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (325 mg po tid) was also administered if the transferrin saturation was below 30% (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored with weekly CBC, white cell differential, and reticulocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examinations were performed at the conclusion of the treatment period and after a 2 week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who responded to therapy were continued on rhEPO at the same dose for 6 additional months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response criteria included: 50% reduction in transfusion requirements compared with the 6 week pre-study period; doubling of reticulocyte count that was maintained on two determinations at least 1 week apart; or an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> by at least 1.2 gm/dl without transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment factors potentially predictive of response were analyzed by univariate analysis and in a multivariate fashion by classification and regression trees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the twenty patients sustained an untransfused rise in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &gt; or = 1.2 gm/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of the sixteen patients (including three of seven patients experiencing a rise in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) who were transfusion-dependent prior to the study achieved a reduction or elimination of their transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of thirteen patients who received rhEPO during the extension phase had a continued response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A low baseline erythropoietin level (&lt; 50 mU/ml) was the best predictor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> response when controlling for other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>rhEPO has a role in the treatment of certain patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in those whose endogenous serum erythropoietin levels are not markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
