<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent base or type abnormalities of the PIG-A gene in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were base substitutions or missense mutations, respectively, and deletions or frameshift mutations, respectively, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several PIG-A mutations, most of which were statistically minor, were found in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-negative cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients but not from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the common PIG-A mutations during the clinical course between CD59- granulocytes and/or CD48- monocytes from each AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient, except for Case 5, were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PIG-A mutations were different between the granulocytes and monocytes from five AA and five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that there were some characteristics of PIG-A mutations in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and that several minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in these patients occurred at random during the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This partly explains the transformation of AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> at intervals </plain></SENT>
