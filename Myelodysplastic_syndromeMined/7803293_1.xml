<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old man was admitted with an evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from RA into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> according to the FAB classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surface expression of membrane effector molecules on neutrophils was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CR1 on neutrophils as identified by staining with CD35 was defective in the patient, and the expression of other complement receptors (CR3 and CR4), Fc receptors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR1 deficiency and defective NAP score on neutrophils in the patient might account for impairment of common storage pool, presumably novel intracellular secretory vesicles </plain></SENT>
