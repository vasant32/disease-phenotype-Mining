<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by a bizarre population of neoplastic cells, which are found systemically within vascular lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although originally thought to be a neoplastic process of the endothelial cells, it has since been demonstrated, by molecular techniques and immunohistochemistry, that the neoplastic cells are of lymphoid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of these lesions includes granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> that can be distinguished from IVLBL or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by the presence of immunohistochemical positivity for myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with a history of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who subsequently developed IVLBL, which demonstrated immunohistochemical positivity for myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this represents the first case of a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to demonstrate such findings </plain></SENT>
