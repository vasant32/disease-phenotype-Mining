<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GTPase regulator associated with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (GRAF), a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, was revealed with mutations and promoter methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the methylation status of GRAF promoter in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of GRAF promoter was detected in 66.7% (88/132) of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methylation of GRAF gene could be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB subtypes and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytogenetic risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical features, FAB subtypes and cytogenetic risk groups between patients with and without GRAF methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GRAF transcript was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group compared to controls (3.30 vs 56.06, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients with methylated GRAF gene and those without methylated GRAF gene had significantly lower GRAF transcript than controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GRAF transcript was significantly lower in patients with methylated GRAF than those without methylated GRAF (1.64 vs 6.42, P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the hypermethylation of GRAF promoter might be one of early events in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
