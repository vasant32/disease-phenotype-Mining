<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) studies could increase the rate of detection of abnormalities, but previous reports in the literature have been contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed I-FISH and conventional karyotyping (G-banding) on 50 MDS patients at diagnosis, after 6 and 12 months or at any time if a transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Applying a probe-panel targeting the centromere of chromosomes 7 and 8, 5q31, 5p15.2 and 7q31, we observed one case with 5q deletion not identified by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I-FISH at 6 and 12 months confirmed the karyotype results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight cases transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> during follow-up, but no hidden clone was detected by I-FISH in any of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of I-FISH during follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> resulted in a small improvement in abnormality detection when compared with conventional G-banding </plain></SENT>
