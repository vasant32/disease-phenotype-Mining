<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the occurrence of an unusual mode of relapse in six of 24 patients who presented with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) associated with trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (TMDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the induction of complete remission (CR) by intensive chemotherapy in five patients and following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in one, the myelodysplastic state, but not overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> occurred at a median of 147 weeks (50-520) from presentation and in two instances was followed a year later by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five cases, myelodysplastic relapse was treated with low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> given alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients remain in CR after 1, 2 and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reappearance of myelodysplastic features in these six patients was strongly correlated with the presence of TMDS at presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was not observed once in the 136 AML patients, treated similarly, who did not have associated TMDS at presentation (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, relapse with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> is not an effect of chemotherapy as has been previously postulated </plain></SENT>
