<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, the subject of a substantial and systematic cytogenetic medullar study (1996-1998), this paper is a case study of 2 syndromes 5q(-) diagnosed in two male patients, respectively, aged 41 and 68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following diagnosis was made on the basis of an aregenerative macrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, a high platelet count, and a megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, along with dysmegakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the 5q(-) syndrome was verified by cytogenetic analysis showing in one of the patients a deletion 5q(-)(q13, q33) and 5q(-)(q14, q34) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in the second one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was only limited to a blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently one of the patients developed an advanced case of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paper suggests that a systematic medullar cytogenetic study must be conducted in the case of any refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in order to identify the syndrome 5q(-) in individual cases </plain></SENT>
