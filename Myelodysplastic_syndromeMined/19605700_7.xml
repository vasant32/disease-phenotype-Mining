<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The oncogene EVI1 has been implicated in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells are characterized by accelerated proliferation and differentiation arrest, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells hyperproliferate when immature but fail to differentiate later and die instead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In agreement with its roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and in immature <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, EVI1 was found to stimulate cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation in several experimental systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the variant protein MDS1/EVI1 caused the opposite effect in some of these assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we expressed EVI1 and MDS1/EVI1 in a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulable manner in the human myeloid cell line U937 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of either of these proteins caused cells to accumulate in the G(0)/G(1)-phase of the cell cycle and moderately increased the rate of spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when EVI1- or MDS1/EVI1-expressing cells were induced to differentiate, they massively succumbed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as reflected by the accumulation of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and increased rates of DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data show that inducible expression of EVI1 in U937 cells causes phenotypes that may be relevant for its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and provides a basis for further investigation of its contribution to this fatal disease </plain></SENT>
