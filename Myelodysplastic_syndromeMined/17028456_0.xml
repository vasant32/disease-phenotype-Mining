<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">Influenza</z:e> vaccination is recommended for individuals over 65 years of age and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases who are at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Side effects which are seen in 1-10% of the vaccinated individuals are usually mild and consist of local reactions and constitutional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 1974, about 30 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We here describe a 70-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, who had received continuous steroid treatment since 2004 and presented with leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> requiring hemodialysis therapy 1 week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-dose steroid treatment was promptly initiated, but hemodialysis was needed for 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maintained steroid treatment for 2 weeks was associated with complete recovery of renal function and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination is increasingly used, physicians should be aware of the potential serious side effect of leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised either due to an underlying disorder or as a treatment-related side effect </plain></SENT>
