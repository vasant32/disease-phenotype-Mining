<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation, observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, generates a chimeric gene where the 5' portion of the sequence encoding the human nucleoporin NUP98 protein is fused to the 3' region of HOXA9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that retroviral-mediated enforced expression of the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein in cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells confers a proliferative advantage in both cytokine-stimulated suspension cultures and stromal coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This advantage is reflected in the selective expansion of hematopoietic stem cells as measured in vitro by cobblestone area-forming cell assays and in vivo by competitive repopulation of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NUP98-HOXA9 expression inhibited erythroid progenitor differentiation and delayed neutrophil maturation in transduced progenitors but strongly enhanced their serial replating efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the transcriptosome of transduced cells revealed up-regulation of several homeobox genes of the A and B cluster as well as of Meis1 and Pim-1 and down-modulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> genes and of CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter gene, when coexpressed with NUP98-HOXA9, reversed the enhanced proliferation of transduced CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike HOXA9, the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion was protected from ubiquitination mediated by Cullin-4A and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting protein stabilization may contribute to the leukemogenic activity of the fusion protein </plain></SENT>
