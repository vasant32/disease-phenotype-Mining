<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were compared with G-banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This last methodology showed 50% of cases with clonal abnormalities whereas CGH detected 70% of cases with copy number changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gains were more frequent than losses and constituted 66% of total changes detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common gains included chromosomes 21 and chromosome region 18p for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and chromosome 17 and region 1p33p35 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Losses represent 34% of changes and the regions involved were 5q31q32, 7q22, 7p12 and 13q21q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CGH revealed additional chromosome imbalances in 12 of 20 cases (60%) which were not detected by traditional cytogenetic studies, demonstrating complex karyotype in 50% (6/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of CGH and G-banding provides an efficient method to identify critical regions present in the malignant clone, which is of great value in the prognosis and outcome of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
