<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The subsets and the polarization of lymphocytes in bone marrow from low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied and compared with those from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 34 patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (IPSS score&lt; or =1.0) who presented abnormal chromosomes and 16 patients with AA were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined T lymphocyte subsets, T cells polarization status, and the percentages of NK cells and of B lymphocytes in bone marrow and compared these parameters between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, 24 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (IPSS score&gt;1.0) presenting abnormal chromosomes and 22 healthy/benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> subjects were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AA patients, the percentage of CD3+ lymphocytes was significantly increased compared to controls (p=0.006 and p=0.001), while the percentage of CD19+ lymphocytes was significantly decreased (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.002); there were no significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in other parameters; For low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the polarization status of bone marrow CD4+ cells toward Th1 (Th1/Th2) and of CD8+ cells toward Tc1 (Tc1/Tc2) was stronger than that for AA patients (p=0.05 and p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other parameters did not show significant differences; Regardless of the predominance of CD4 or CD8 T cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were accompanied with elevated Tc1 polarization (Tc1/Tc2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In both AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the number of total T lymphocytes increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, polarization towards Th1 and Tc1 was obviously stronger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This might be related to T cell stimulation from the clones of malignant hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
