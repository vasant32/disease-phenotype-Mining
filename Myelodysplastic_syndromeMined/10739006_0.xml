<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reported that low-dose aclarubicin (ACR) therapy is effective in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that a low concentration of ACR induces the in vitro differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACR (0.1 ng/ml) significantly increased the number of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-dependent colonies from circulating blast cells in vitro in six out of seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast in transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the effect of ACR gradually disappeared along with the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the majority of G-CSF/ACR-dependent colonies consisted of rather differentiated myeloid cells such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes, whereas colonies formed by G-CSF alone were composed mainly of immature blastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of G-CSF-responding progenitors significantly increased during a 24-48 h incubation with ACR alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The circulating blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients expressed G-CSF receptors at unchanged levels before and after the incubation with ACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that ACR might increase clonogenic progenitor responsiveness to G-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, probably through modulating downstream signaling cascades associated with G-CSF receptors, and induce these progenitors to differentiate in response to G-CSF </plain></SENT>
