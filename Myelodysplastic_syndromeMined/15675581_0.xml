<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients received conventional stem cell transplantation (CST) and 9 patients received reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regimen-related toxicity was observed in 21 (91%) patients with CST and 4 (44%) patients with RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred within 100 days after transplantation in 6 patients with CST and 2 patients with RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with complete remission, the two-year probability rate of survival was 44% in patients with CST and 100% in patients with RIST (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients without complete remission, the two-year probability rate of survival was 30% in patients with CST and 0% in those with RIST (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that patients without complete remission should receive CST to the degree possible </plain></SENT>
