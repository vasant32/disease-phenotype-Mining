<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 4 unusual cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with distinct persistent nodular lesions noted on serial bone marrow examinations, even during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions were predominantly composed of immature monocytes that stained positively for CD68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 9 and 11 were demonstrated in the cells of the nodular lesions and surrounding marrow of 1 patient, indicating the same clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRb), proliferation-related protein (Ki-67), multiple drug-resistant enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e>, and topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) revealed decreased topoisomerase expression within the nodular lesions compared with the surrounding marrow and absence of Ki-67 antigen within nodular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most cells in the lesion were not in a proliferative cycle, with very low expression of Topo IIalpha, which may explain the apparent drug resistance of these nodular lesions </plain></SENT>
