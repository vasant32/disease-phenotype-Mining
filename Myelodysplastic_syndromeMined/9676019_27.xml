<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate to what extent other balanced chromosome aberrations show the same association, and to evaluate a possible relationship to patient age and subgroups of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> previously published cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with any type of balanced aberration identified from Felix Mitelman's Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> were analyzed for age and type of previous therapy, and the results were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 422 cases were recorded, 328 had previously received well specified types of chemotherapy; 254 presented one out of five characteristic balanced aberrations, whereas 168 cases presented different uncharacteristic balanced aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis cases with translocations to 11q23 had most often received DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, whereas patients with the uncharacteristic balanced rearrangements most often had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.00000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) were likewise significantly associated with previous therapy with DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> and to almost the same extent as translocations to 21q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with translocations to 11q23 were significantly younger as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Translocations to 11q23 predominated following therapy with epipodophyllotoxins, whereas patients with translocations to 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) most often had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis taking age into consideration, however, these drug-specific associations were no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Specific balanced chromosome aberrations in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> involving chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with previous therapy with DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, as compared to the uncharacteristic balanced aberrations most commonly observed after therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Younger age and not a specific type of DNA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> seems to predispose specifically to development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with translocations to chromosome band 11q23 </plain></SENT>
