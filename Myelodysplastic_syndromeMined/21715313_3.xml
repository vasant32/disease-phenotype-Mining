<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed 83 patients (age, 16-70 years): 68 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (including 34 in remission and 34 with refractory disease) and 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, in HCT trials using RIC with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HLA-haploidentical donors, offspring (n = 38), mothers (n = 24), or siblings (n = 21) of patients, underwent leukapheresis after receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and donated cells were transplanted without further manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were given for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment, grade 2 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, and transplantation-related mortality after HCT, were 92%, 20%, 34%, and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 26.6 months (range, 16.8-78.8 months), the event-free and overall survival rates were 56% and 45%, respectively, for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in remission; 9% and 9%, respectively, for patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; and 53% and 53%, respectively, for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HCT from an HLA-haploidentical family member resulted in favorable outcomes when RIC containing antithymocyte globulin was performed </plain></SENT>
