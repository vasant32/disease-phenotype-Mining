<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of LAA, alternating with supplementation to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036474" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">scurvy</z:e>, would provide therapeutic benefit, a single-arm pilot trial was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00329498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental results: During <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> phase, patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were placed on a diet deficient in LAA; during supplementation phase, patients received daily intravenous administration of LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An in vitro assay was performed pretherapy for LAA sensitivity of leukemic cells from individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Of 18 patients enrolled, eight of 16 evaluable patients demonstrated a clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were obtained during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (four patients) as well as during supplementation (five patients) but at a pharmacologic plasma level achievable only with intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of nine patients for whom the in vitro assay indicated their leukemic cells were sensitive to LAA, seven exhibited a clinical response; compared with none of six patients who were insensitive to LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The clinical benefit, along with a conspicuous absence of significant adverse events, suggests that further testing of LAA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> alternating with pharmacologic dose intravenous supplementation in patients with these and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is warranted </plain></SENT>
