<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 355 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> using "next-generation" sequencing for TET2 aberrations, 91 of whom were also subjected to single-nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one TET2 mutations, with a relative mutation abundance (RMA) â‰¥ 10%, were identified in 39 of 320 (12%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 16 of 35 (46%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 4 patients had multiple mutations likely to exist as independent clones or on alternate alleles, suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>. "Deeper" sequencing of 96 patient samples identified 4 additional mutations (RMA, 3%-6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, TET2 mutant clones were also found in T cells, in addition to CD34(+) and total bone marrow cells (23.5%, 38.5%, and 43% RMA, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 20% of the TET2-mutated patients showed loss of heterozygosity at the TET2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the frequency of genome-wide aberrations, TET2 expression, or the JAK2V617F 46/1 haplotype between TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant prognostic association between TET2 mutations and World Health Organization subtypes, International Prognostic Scoring System score, cytogenetic status, or transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age (&gt; 50 years) was associated with a higher incidence of TET2 mutation (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
