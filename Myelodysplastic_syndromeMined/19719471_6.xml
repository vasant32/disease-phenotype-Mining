<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Iron chelation therapy (ICT) has been shown to improve survival and quality of life in patients; however, ICT utilization in clinical practices is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> at least 6 months before data extraction, aged at least 21 years at diagnosis, and who received at least one RBC transfusion were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICT eligibility was defined as at least 20 units of RBCs transfused or at least two serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study endpoint was ICT treatment rate among ICT-eligible patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (International Prognostic Scoring System [low or intermediate-1]; World Health Organization [<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> {RA}, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> {<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>}, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> {<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>}, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and ringed sideroblasts, or 5q]; French-American-British [RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At ICT initiation, treated patients received on average 13.3 transfusions (27.6 units) and mean first post-ICT initiation serum ferritin was twice the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Foundation recommendation at 1949 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ICT-eligible patients was significantly longer for those ICT-treated patients than untreated patients (8.7 years vs. 4.7 years, log-rank p = 0.02; multivariate hazard ratio 0.372, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study finds only 41% of ICT-eligible patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received ICT in clinical practice, and treatment was initiated later than recommended </plain></SENT>
