<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paradox has been proposed to be due to the presence of excessive proliferation matched by excessive intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When cultured in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BM mononuclear cells (BMMC) undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> within 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like activity in 22 MDS and 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM immediately following cell separation or after 4 h culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When cultured in vitro, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BMMC demonstrated an increased apoptotic index within 4 h as measured by in situ end-labeling of fragmented DNA that was matched by a concurrent increase in caspase-3-like specific activity, and the two were significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 4 h culture, a sequential activation of caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like activities was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-1-like specific activity was detected early and transiently at approximately 15 min, followed by a gradual increase in caspase-3-like-specific activity peaking at 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD.FMK, was included in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BM aspirate 4 h culture, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that sequential activation of caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like activities may form the central biochemical pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BMMC from some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and prevention of this process by caspase inhibitors may be of significant therapeutic value for these patients, in whom supportive care continues to be the mainstay of therapy </plain></SENT>
