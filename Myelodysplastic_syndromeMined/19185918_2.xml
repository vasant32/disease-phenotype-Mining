<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the Topo IIalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by real-time RT-PCR in 37 paired samples at diagnosis and at relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukemic patients in relation to drug sensitivity and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Topo IIalpha levels in leukemic blasts at relapse were significantly higher than that at diagnosis, especially in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in the Topo IIalpha level at relapse was significant in cases which could not achieve a second remission, but not significant in cases which achieved a second remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the change of Topo IIalpha expression in leukemic blasts at relapse may predict therapeutic responsiveness </plain></SENT>
