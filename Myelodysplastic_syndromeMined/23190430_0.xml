<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and dose reductions/delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety and tolerability of the thrombopoietin mimetic romiplostim and its effects on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (CSTEs) in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients receiving lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were assigned to weekly placebo (n = 12) or romiplostim 500 μg (n = 14) or 750 μg (n = 13) for four 28-day lenalidomide cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment groups were generally similar with respect to baseline disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Del(5q) abnormalities were noted in 1 (8%) patient in the placebo group, 3 (21%) in the romiplostim 500 μg group, and two (15%) in the 750 μg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSTEs were noted in 8 (67%) patients in the placebo group, 4 (29%) in the romiplostim 500 μg group, and 8 (62%) in the romiplostim 750 μg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Throughout the study, median platelet counts trended lower in placebo-treated than in romiplostim-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>-related adjustments in lenalidomide occurred in 6 (50%) patients in the placebo group, 5 (36%) in the romiplostim 500 μg group, and 2 (15%) in the 750 μg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the percentages of patients who received platelet transfusions were similar across treatment groups, there was a trend toward lower numbers of transfusions in both romiplostim groups during each treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two serious treatment-related adverse events during the treatment period (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, placebo; worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, romiplostim 500 μg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (romiplostim 500 and 750 μg, respectively) had an increase in bone marrow blasts to &gt;20% during treatment, but had no post-treatment biopsy to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that romiplostim administered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients during lenalidomide treatment may decrease the frequency of dose reductions/delays due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional study is needed to confirm the results of this preliminary trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00418665 </plain></SENT>
