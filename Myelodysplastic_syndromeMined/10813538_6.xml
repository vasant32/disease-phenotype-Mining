<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol and low-density and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) were found to be significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (p = 0.0001, 0.0038 and 0.037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were negatively related to biopsy cellularity (p = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively), and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were negatively related to labeling index (p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with abnormal karyotypes had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels compared with the high-risk patients (p = 0.027), as did low-risk patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher for the low-risk group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics as well (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> are significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, probably indicating excessive intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> biosynthesis in the expanding clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relatively simple measurements could serve as important prognostic markers and reliable indicators of disease activity in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies to determine their utility as independent variables that guide the need for active therapeutic intervention are warranted </plain></SENT>
