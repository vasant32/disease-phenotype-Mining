<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the presence and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=35) and numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17 and 18 in clinical remission by using a combination of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique enables the detection of as few as three leukaemic cells in 10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was detected in 33/35 patients in complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 patients relapsed (8/11 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, 4/17 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, and 4/7 with other cytogenetic abnormalities) after a median of 4.8 months (range 3-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> (P=0.007) and proliferation index (P=0.011) were significantly higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 than in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or other cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells in S-phase, the number of abnormal cells and cytogenetic class were related to time to relapse (P=0.001) with S-phase being the single most important prognostic factor (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination of FACS/FISH/BUdR, which determines the number, phenotype and proliferation rate of very rare leukaemic cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in clinical remission, provides information that is useful in the identification of patients with high and low likelihood of relapse </plain></SENT>
