<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 24 pregnancies who were found bicytopenia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> during pregnancy for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were reconfirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The management and pregnancy outcome were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the prognoses were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the clinical data and laboratory findings, the latter including complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> level, autoimmune antibody screening, bone marrow smear and biopsy, thirteen patients were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA), six as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), two as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> (MA), one as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), one as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evan's syndrome</z:e> and one as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The management basically consisted of supportive transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> including four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> (one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and one with intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> concomitantly) and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The delivery ages of the 21 patients were term or nearly term with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> good neonatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postpartum follow-up showed the two patients with MA achieved complete remission, the one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and that with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evan's syndrome</z:e> had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> died of recurrence six months postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the thirteen patients with CAA, two achieved complete remission, six partial remission, four no remission and one was lost follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, one achieved partial remission, four no remission, and one transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, then refused chemotherapy and was lost follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAA may be one of the most common causes of bicytopenia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> during pregnancy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis should be made as soon as possible through appropriate and reasonable laboratory examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most patients could achieve good pregnancy outcomes through supportive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The maternal prognosis may vary widely depending on the causes </plain></SENT>
