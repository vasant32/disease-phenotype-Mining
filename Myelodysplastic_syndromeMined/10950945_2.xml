<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To detect a small population of blood cells with a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, we evaluated the expression of CD59 by flow cytometry on one million erythrocytes, which is about 100 times more than the number of erythrocytes tested by our standard immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples from healthy volunteers, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed no detectable GPI deficiency by the standard assay, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of CD59-deficient erythrocytes were 5 to 145/10(6) erythrocytes in the healthy volunteers (mean 29.2), and one of the volunteers had an increase in the deficient cells exceeding the mean + 3 SD (141.7), a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CD59-deficient population was detected in 6 of the 21 (28.6%) patients with AA and 5 of the 18 (27.8%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new assay was performed again in 5 of these 11 patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual who had the CD59-deficient populations at 6 and 12 months after the initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of deficient cells gradually increased in 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (from 511 to 2892/10(6) erythrocytes), while the numbers of the other 4 patients showed a tendency to decline, although the deficient populations were repeatedly detected on most of the occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in the number of the deficient cells were also seen in the healthy volunteer, but they were rather rapid; the numbers changed from 145 to 5661 and then to 18/10(6) erythrocytes within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD59 assay used in this study is easy to perform and enabled us to detect less than 1% GPI-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
