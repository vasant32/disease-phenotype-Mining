<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the contribution of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) toward the detection of recurring unbalanced chromosomal anomalies at diagnosis, a systematic screening of -5/del(5)(q31), -7, and chromosome 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was performed on 110 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5/del(5q) by one-color I-FISH with a probe specific for the 5q31 region and for -7/8 by dual-color I-FISH with centromeric probes for chromosomes 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between conventional cytogenetics (CC) and I-FISH were observed in 8 of the 110 patients (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For -5/del(5)(q31), a discordance was observed in two patients with complex abnormalities involving chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas no discordance was observed for -7, I-FISH detected a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7 unnoticed by CC in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six patients, I-FISH revealed a chromosome 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> not detected by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results illustrate that, when using this specific set of probes, I-FISH is of special interest for the detection of minor clones with chromosome 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, breakpoint assessment, and sequence identification (markers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, to avoid misinterpretations, I-FISH should not be used alone at disease presentation, particularly in cases complex changes that have clearly established prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
