<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although prophylactic antifungal therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (FLCZ) has become the standard care for these patients, there remains a need for more effective and cost-beneficial alternative drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the usefulness of the administration of micafungin (MCFG) as a prophylactic antifungal therapy for patients undergoing allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with previous data for patients who had received FLCZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 44 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from 29 patients who received allogeneic SCT using prophylactic FLCZ before this study were used as historical control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Underlying diseases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 16), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 6), and others (n = 11) in the MCFG group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6), and others (n = 5) in the FLCZ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median durations of administration of MCFG and FLCZ were 36 and 34 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic success, defined as the absence of proven, probable, and possible invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (IFI) until the end of prophylactic therapy was achieved in 36 (87.8%) of the 41 evaluated patients in the MCFG group and in 65.5% of the patients in the FLCZ group (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients in the MCFG group showed proven or probable IFI, whereas proven or probable IFI was observed in three patients in the FLCZ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients in the MCFG group required dose escalation due to febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although one patient in the MCFG group required the discontinuation of MCFG due to allergic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> (grade 2), none of the other patients in either group required dose reduction due to adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the study design was not a prospective randomized trial, our results indicate that the administration of MCFG at a daily dose of 100 mg is promising for prophylactic antifungal therapy in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
