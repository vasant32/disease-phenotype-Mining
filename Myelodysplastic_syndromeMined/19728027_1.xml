<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We characterized the prevalence, clinical and cytogenetic characteristics and survival of 435 patients diagnosed with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in a single laboratory according to WHO criteria, and compared the utility of different scoring systems to predict survival for individual subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 25.1 (5.5-53.2) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm major differences in the age-distribution and prevalence of individual subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> between Asian and Western patients with a median age of 58 years and a predominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (69.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were similar to those reported in the West: the 3-year survival rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 46.7% with a median survival time for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> of 38 months and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the IPSS and WPSS scoring systems, which are weighted heavily by blast cell count and karyotype, were not independent predictors for survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a scoring system based on age (&gt; or =60 years), ANC (&lt;1.0 x 10(9)/L), Hb (&lt;90 g/L), number of cytopenias and complex karyotype is a more useful predictor of survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
