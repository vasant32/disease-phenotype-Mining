<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have designed an assay for the simultaneous measurement of cell surface phenotype, S-phase fraction, and DNA content by single laser instrumentation for the purpose of determining the labeling index (LI), duration of S-phase (Ts), and the potential doubling time (Tpot) of leukocyte subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure was optimized with regard to: mode of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, selection of suitable leukocyte differentiation antigens (LDAs) as well as PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against myeloid cells, overnight permeabilization and fixation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> 1% and 0.05% Nonidet P40), DNase I treatment (250 Kunitz units), concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated anti-BrdUrd MoAb (dilution 1:5), and DNA staining with 7-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15369">actinomycin</z:chebi> (7-AAD) (10 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We validated this assay by measuring LI, Ts, and Tpot repeatedly in four leukemic cell lines and found these to be stable (coefficients of variation (CV): 0.06, 0.13, and 0.08, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we employed the assay on different leukocyte preparations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (including purified CD34 + cells) and patients with malignant myeloid disorders, and we concluded that it will yield valuable data regarding the cell cycle kinetics of subsets of leukocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> mixtures of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
