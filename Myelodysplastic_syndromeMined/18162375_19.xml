<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An open-label, multicentre, prospective, pilot study was conducted in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (AL) or myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received weekly 10mg/kg infusions of L-AmB for 4 weeks for AL and 8 weeks for SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was safety, with particular attention to infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine adult patients were included: 21 AL (median age 52 years) and 8 SCT (median age 37 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events (AEs) related to study drug were infusion-related reactions, 12 of which (from a total of 76 infusions) led to increased infusion duration for better tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No AE related to the study drug led to discontinuation of prophylactic treatment in AL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SCT patients, eight AEs (in six patients) reported to be related to study treatment led to treatment discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enrolment was discontinued in the SCT group as recommended by the independent data review committee in accordance with the 10% limit of AEs (CTC grade 3-4) fixed by the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The appropriate timing of high-dose prophylactic L-AmB remains to be determined in the SCT setting to optimise the safety profile of this regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For AL, a 10mg/kg weekly dose appears to be well tolerated during chemotherapy and may represent an important tool towards improving AL patient outcome </plain></SENT>
