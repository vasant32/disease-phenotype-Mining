<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five cases, genomic gains or losses were identified, which mapped to chromosomal regions known to be involved in this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the results obtained by banding analysis, discrepancies were found in three of the ten cases; in two cases, chromosomal imbalances were not identified by CGH because they were present only in small subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other case, there were no evaluable metaphase cells for banding analysis; CGH revealed an overrepresentation of chromosome 8, which was confirmed by interphase cytogenetics with a chromosome 8-specific alphoid probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> abnormalities revealed by CGH were confirmed by G-banding or subsequent interphase cytogenetic analysis, which demonstrates the high specificity of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, CGH identified the chromosomal imbalances present in the major clone as detected by banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The good correlation between CGH and chromosome banding results in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> makes this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> a good model for the assessment of tools that are developed for automated and quantitative CGH analysis </plain></SENT>
