<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The engraftment capacity of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells was investigated in 41 patients who had received a sex-mismatched, T-cell-depleted allograft from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or -mismatched family donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (HUMARA) or the amelogenin genes was used to detect donor-derived mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 14 marrow samples (34%) from 41 consenting patients generated a marrow stromal layer adequate for PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocyte-macrophage contamination of marrow stromal layers was reduced below the levels of sensitivity of HUMARA and amelogenin assays (5% and 3%, respectively) by repeated trypsinizations and treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-leucine (leu-leu) <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who received allografts from 12 female donors were analyzed by means of the HUMARA assay, and in 5 of 12 cases a partial female origin of stromal cells was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients who received allografts from male donors were analyzed by amplifying the amelogenin gene, and in both cases a partial male origin of stromal cells was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using a Y probe confirmed the results of PCR analysis and demonstrated in 2 cases the existence of a mixed chimerism at the stromal cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference detected between the dose of fibroblast progenitors (colony-forming unit-F [CFU-F]) infused to patients with donor- or host-derived stromal cells (1.18 +/- 0.13 x 10(4)/kg vs 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>19 +/- 0.19 x 10(4)/kg; P &gt;/=.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, marrow stromal progenitors reinfused in patients receiving a T-cell-depleted allograft have a limited capacity of reconstituting marrow mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
