<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted covering English-language studies published from 1980 to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies qualified: five controlled trials (n = 354), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epoetin versus control (EvC); 51 epoetin single-arm studies (n = 1,650); and three darbepoetin single-arm studies (n = 102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the EvC studies, epoetin patients demonstrated a significant advantage over controls in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) response (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-10.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hb response was 48.1% in single-arm darbepoetin studies, 32.1% in epoetin single-arm studies, and 27.3% in EvC studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major Hb response averaged 38.8% in darbepoetin studies, 24.5% in epoetin single-arm studies, and 11.4% in EvC studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses suggest that lower baseline erythropoietin levels, longer treatment durations, and concurrent iron may be associated with greater Hb response to ESPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the analyzable predictors of Hb response (gender, baseline Hb, ESP type, and ESP duration) were significant in meta-regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the few studies with quality-of-life measures, ESP groups attained a pre-post change (Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy - <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp>) that exceeded minimum clinically important differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selected adverse event rates did not differ between the epoetin and darbepoetin groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Published studies suggest that ESPs are efficacious in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hb response appears higher in darbepoetin patients than in epoetin patients, and safety appears comparable, but darbepoetin data are sparse, and there are as yet no direct comparison studies </plain></SENT>
