<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and is recognized as a critical event in the disease's pathogenesis and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to investigate the methylation status of p15 and p16, cell cycle regulatory genes, in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 9) and juvenile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>; n = 18) by using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p15 hypermethylation in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 78% (7/9), which was comparable to that in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p15 hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> was a rare event (17%; 3/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>, clinical and laboratory characteristics including PTPN11 mutations and aberrant colony formation were not different between the three patients with hypermethylated p15 and the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of p16 was not detected in children with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since p15 and p16 genes were unmethylated in two children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>, in whom the disease had progressed with an increased number of blasts, a condition referred to as blastic crisis, we infer that the aberrant methylation of these genes is not responsible for the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that demethylating agents may be effective in most children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a few patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
