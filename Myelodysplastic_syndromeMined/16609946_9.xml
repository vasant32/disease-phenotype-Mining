<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) have a markedly increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, patients with FA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> have extremely poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are currently no clinical trials or case series addressing the use of chemotherapy for children with FA, except in the context of preparative regimens for stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe the toxicity of a chemotherapy approach for patients with FA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> to achieve cytoreduction prior to SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with FA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were treated with chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> 300 mg/m(2) each on days 2-4 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 microg/kg on days 1-5), termed reduced intensity FLAG prior to SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The chemotherapy was well tolerated with expected hematologic toxicity and no measurable toxicity in other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cleared blasts from their bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction in marrow cellularity was also achieved in one patient with hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that children with FA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> can tolerate chemotherapy and achieve clearance of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether pre-SCT chemotherapy improves currently poor survival rates for SCT in FA patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and further studies are needed to determine if there is a clinical role for this strategy </plain></SENT>
