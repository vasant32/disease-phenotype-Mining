<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza-CdR), is a well-characterized drug that is now Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although 5-aza-CdR is an extremely potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, it is subject to degradation by hydrolytic cleavage and deamination by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that short oligonucleotides containing a 5-aza-CdR can also inhibit DNA methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells at concentrations comparable with 5-aza-CdR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies with S110, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi>, showed that it works via a mechanism similar to that of 5-aza-CdR after incorporation of its aza-moiety into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38056">triazine</z:chebi> ring in aqueous solution was not improved in the S110 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi>; however, deamination by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase was dramatically decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of the use of short oligonucleotides to provide effective delivery and cellular uptake of a nucleotide drug and protection from enzymatic degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach may pave the way for more stable and potent inhibitors of DNA methylation as well as provide means for improving existing therapeutics </plain></SENT>
