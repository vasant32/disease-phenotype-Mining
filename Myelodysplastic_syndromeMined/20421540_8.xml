<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients were treated, of whom 22 had intermediate-2 or high-risk disease (International Prognostic Scoring System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 70 years (range, 53 to 86), nine patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, and 20 patients experienced prior therapy failure with hypomethylating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three doses of clofarabine were evaluated: 40 mg/m(2), 30 mg/m(2), and 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Courses were repeated every 4 to 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (25%) achieved complete remission (CR), three had (9%) hematologic improvement (HI), and three had (9%) clinical benefit (CB; overall response rate, 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses in patients who experience treatment failure with hypomethylating agents included CR in two (10%), HI in two (10%), and CB in two patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients died within 6 weeks of induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>Renal failure</z:hpo> occurred in four patients in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>-associated infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common adverse events were gastrointestinal and hepatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was common, but prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> (&gt; 42 days) was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile was better with lower doses of clofarabine, whereas response rates did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral clofarabine has achieved a response rate of 43% in patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The optimal dose and schedule and the appropriate patient population for such therapy remain to be further defined </plain></SENT>
