<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on therapy for subtypes other than gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been largely limited to retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective phase 2 study of fludarabine and rituximab for the treatment of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> enrolled 26 patients, 14 with nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, eight with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and four with splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>; 81% were receiving initial systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 58% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37-77%] of patients completed the planned six cycles, due to significant haematological, infectious and allergic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four late toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> [15% (95% CI 4.3-35%)], two related to delayed bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and two related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the overall response rate was 85% (95% CI 65-96%), with 54% complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival at 3.1 years of follow-up is 79.5% (95% CI 63-96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, although concurrent fludarabine and rituximab given at this dose and schedule is a highly effective regimen in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>, the significant haematological and infectious toxicity observed both during and after therapy is prohibitive in this patient population, emphasizing the need to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> as a separate entity </plain></SENT>
