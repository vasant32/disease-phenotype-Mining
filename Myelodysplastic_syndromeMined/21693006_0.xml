<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study cohort was composed of BC patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2005 and followed up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorders</z:e>, mean length of follow up = 7.17 years, range 2-18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5790 TNM stage 0-III patients treated with surgery alone, radiation and/or chemotherapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients without surgery (n = 111), with stem cell transplantation (n = 98), unknown or non-standard chemotherapy regimens (n = 94), lost to follow up (n = 66) or '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> status unknown' (n = 67) were excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 17 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (10 MDS/7 AML) occurred during the follow up period, crude rate .29% (95% CI = .17, .47), SEER comparison RR = 3.94 (95% CI = 2.34, 6.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in patients age &lt; 65 comparing our cohort incidence to SEER incidence data was 10.88 (95% CI = 3.84, 24.03) and the RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients age &lt; 65 was 5.32 (95% CI = 1.31, 14.04) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A RR of 3.32 (95% CI = 1.42, 6.45) was observed in the surgery/radiation-only group and a RR of 6.32 (95% CI = 3.03, 11.45) in the surgery/radiation/chemotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 out of 10 MDS cases died of disease at an average 3.8 months post diagnosis and five of seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases died at an average 9 months post diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An elevated rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients &lt; 65, those treated with radiation and those treated with radiation and chemotherapy compared to available population incidence data </plain></SENT>
