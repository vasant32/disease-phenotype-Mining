<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past 10-20 years, there has been a growing interest in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to difficulties of diagnosis, classification and case recording, the epidemiological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are still poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries have published data on the regional occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are much more common than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in these studies was 3.5-12.6 per 100,000 population per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In people over the age of 70 years, incidence rates varied between 15 and 50 per 100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the assumption of most hematologists, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveys usually failed to demonstrate a rising incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those studies showing a significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the rising number of cases was probably due to increased physician awareness and extended use of invasive diagnostic procedures in elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in incidence figures between regional studies may be attributed to several causes, including regional variations in disease incidence, small and ill-defined reference populations, bias due to patient referral patterns, varying intensity of diagnostic procedures and different observation periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the paucity of clinical symptoms and insignificance of morphological bone marrow changes particularly in early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the currently available incidence figures are likely to underestimate the true incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large-scale epidemiological studies are required for obtaining truly representative statistics on the incidence and prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In industrialized countries, a dramatic increase in these disorders can be expected over the next few decades due to the 'greying' of the population </plain></SENT>
