<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The designations M6Er and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Er were introduced where the suffix "Er" indicated preponderance of erythroid component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chief hematologic abnormalities included circulating blast cells in 98% of the cases, with 36.7% cases having &gt;30% blast cells, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in approximately 86 to 88% of the cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical patterns of neutrophilic markers were evident in most cases of Ml and M2, while monocytic markers were primarily seen in M5a and M5b cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that well-prepared, Romanowsky-stained blood and bone marrow smears should be examined to determine blast cell types and percentages for cytomorphologic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Carefully selected areas of stained films presenting adequate cellular details should be used to count a minimum of 200 cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A blast cell count of &gt; 30% in blood and/or bone marrow indicates <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e>, while a count of &lt; 30% blasts in bone marrow suggests <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, or even a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023501" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leukemoid reaction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
