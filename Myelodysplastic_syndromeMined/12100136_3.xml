<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of a reduced-intensity regimen combining a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogue and busulphan did not delay erythrocyte recovery after major ABO-incompatible transplantation, suggesting this regimen had a strong activity against host plasma cell </plain></SENT>
