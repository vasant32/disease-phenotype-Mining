<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Planning therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is difficult because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of the disease and varying patient age at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics and patient age at the time of diagnosis are two major factors determining treatment outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics have much lower complete remission rates than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients greater than 55 to 60 years of age often exhibits a resistant phenotype, more akin to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This group is also characterized by lower complete remission rates, and often requires the delivery of intensive therapy to a patient population that is the least likely to tolerate it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the Jefferson Health System (Philadelphia, PA), we wished to develop a regimen that was maximally intensive to treat stubborn disease, but gentle enough to be given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients regardless of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toward this end, 33 patients received a maximal dose of the cytoprotective agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>, before each infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> in the "7 + 3" regimen, escalating the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> in a phase I fashion to a maximum dose of 24 mg/m2  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> to "7 + 3" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> induction therapy enables a substantial escalation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> dose through the 21-mg/m2 dose level, without a concomitant increase in side effects, thus providing a regimen that is both intensive and applicable to patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, phase II studies are ongoing on a national basis to evaluate the efficacy of this regimen </plain></SENT>
