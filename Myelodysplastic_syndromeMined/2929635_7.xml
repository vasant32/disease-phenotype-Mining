<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, myeloperoxidase stain and specific stains for lysozyme and esterase were helpful in confirming the histologic diagnosis of granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite multiple attempts to control this patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> by conservative surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, we eventually had to resort to limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure restored a meaningful quality of life to this patient for one and a half years prior to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> at the time of surgery may have prevented a local recurrence of granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> despite positive tissue margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience underscores the importance of directing treatment toward the granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> concurrently present may not require therapy for several years </plain></SENT>
