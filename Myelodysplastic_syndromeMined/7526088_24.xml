<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients with poor prognosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) received therapy with two courses of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day + ara-C 2 g/m2/day (days 1-5) and G-CSF 5 mg/kg/day (FLAG) (from day 0 to polymorphonuclear recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were considered 'refractory' (eight primarily resistant, five relapsing within 6 months of initial remission, or at a second relapse; five relapsing after an autologous bone marrow transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten cases were defined 'secondary' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> made after a preexisting diagnosis of: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>: five cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>: one case; previously untreated, and concomitant, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: two cases; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> treated with chemoradiotherapy: one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 15 patients (58%) achieved a complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during induction, and 11 had resistant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the data in relation to selected host and disease characteristics, the response varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest CR rates (89%) were obtained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>; in particular, two cases of 'second-primary' (concomitant with low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> obtained CR for both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> differed widely for response: high CR rate (75%), although with short mean CR duration for primary resistance <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and very poor response (11% CR) for relapsed (early, second, after ABMT) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a slow kinetic of leukemic growth in vivo before FLAG administration was significantly related to the response and outcome (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematological and nonhematological toxicities were acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the FLAG regimen has significant antileukemic activity and acceptable toxicity especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, both with and without coexisting lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
