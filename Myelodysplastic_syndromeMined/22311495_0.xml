<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate cytogenetic features and outcome of chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia negative cells (Ph(-)CAs) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients in which Ph(-)CAs occurred after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> therapy were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 15 cases with Ph(-)CAs, 12 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, 2 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> and 1 was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39112">bosutinib</z:chebi>. + 8 was the most common abnormality in Ph(-)CAs, which accounted for 46.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ph(-)CAs usually occurred when Ph(+)cells decreased or disappeared due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average time for the appearance of Ph(-)CAs was 11.1 months (1-28 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients, the Ph(-)CAs have disappeared in 10.9 months (3-24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In such patients, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient has progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with Ph(+)cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining patients have achieved bone morrow remission, among which 11 patients achieved complete cytogenic response and 4 patients even achieved complete molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of Ph(-)CAs developed in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients are transient in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They may develop following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39112">bosutinib</z:chebi> therapy but do not interfere with the therapeutic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
