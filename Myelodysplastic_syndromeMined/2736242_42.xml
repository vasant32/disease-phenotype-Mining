<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The outcome of treatment with standard first line therapy of 66 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) secondary to preceding chemotherapy (Group 1), a myelodysplastic state (Group 2) or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (Group 3) was analysed in relation to the preceding disorder, the cytogenetic pattern where available, and the cytology and cytochemistry of blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complete remission (CR) rate for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AMLs</z:e> was 36% (24/66), with 24% (16/66) dying in the induction period and 39% (26/66) having resistant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was 25% (5/20) for Group 1, 42% (15/36) for Group 2, and 40% (4/10) for Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even after allowance for the generally older age of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> patients, they still had a significantly poorer CR rate than the de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lower CR rate was chiefly due to resistant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, overall survival was not significantly worse for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> patients (P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the 36% that achieved remission, remission duration appeared similar to that of de novo cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 62 cases with adequate cytology, 38 (61%) had evidence of erythroid and/or megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with a CR rate of 32% (12/38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CR rate of these multineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> was not significantly different from that of the 24 (39%) who showed granulocyte/monocyte precursor involvement only, 42% (10) of whom achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of features of differentiation within blast cells such as Auer rods or sudanophilia (greater than 50% positive blasts) was associated with a higher remission rate 47% (18/38) than that of poorly differentiated cases 17% (3/18) (P = 0.04) and thus appeared to be a more important determinant of CR achievement than was lineage involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cases with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype had a 33% (7/21) CR rate, while those with chromosomal abnormalities had a 37% (9/24) CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 12 of the 45 cases with adequate cytogenetic analysis showed deletions or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> involving chromosomes 5 or 7, and seven of these were in Group 1 </plain></SENT>
