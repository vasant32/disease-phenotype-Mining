<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Communicating channels called gap junctions are thought to play a ubiquitous part in cell growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on earlier work, we have recently found functional evidence of their presence in human and mouse bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we studied the cell-type association of the gap junction channel-forming protein, connexin, in mouse and human bone marrow under different physiological and pathological conditions and tested the pathway of communication in bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For high-resolution antigen demonstration we took advantage of semi-thin resin sections, antigen retrieval methods, immunofluorescence, and confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Connexin43 (Cx43) and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were consistently expressed in human and rodent marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cx37 was found only in the arteriolar endothelium, but neither Cx32 nor -26 were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In tissue sections, the immunostained junctions appeared as dots, which were digitally measured and counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their average size was 0.40 mm in human and 0.49 mm in mice marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were at least twice as many gap junctions in the femoral midshaft of 6-week-old mice (1.75 x 10(5)/mm3) as in those older than 12 weeks (0.89 x 10(5)/mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most Cx43 was associated with collagen III+ endosteal and adventitial stromal cells and with megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elsewhere, they were few and randomly distributed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the femoral epiphysis of juvenile mice, stromal cell processes full of Cx43 enmeshed three to six layers of hematopoietic cells near the endosteum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The same pattern was seen in the midshaft of regenerating mouse marrow 3 to 5 days after cytotoxic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Functional tests in cultures showed the transfer of small fluorescent dyes, Lucifer Yellow and 2',7'-bis-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50329">2-carboxyethyl</z:chebi>)-5, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39073">6-carboxyfluorescein</z:chebi>, between stromal cells and in rare cases between stromal and hematopoietic cells too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The stromal cells were densely packed with Cx43 and we found aggregates of connexon particles in their membrane replicas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In normocellular human bone marrow, gap junctions were as rare as in adult mouse and similarly distributed, except that they were also on adipocytic membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In a few leukemic samples, characterized by an increased stromal/hematopoietic cell ratio, there were two- to fourfold more Cx43 (2.8 x 10(5) to 3.9 x 10(5)/mm3) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (1.0 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(5)/mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The cases included a hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (French-American-British classification M4-5), a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with elevated number of megakaryocytes, and a CD34+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemoblastosis, probably <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (French-American-British classification M7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that direct cell-cell communication may be involved in hematopoiesis, ie, in developmentally active epiphyseal bone marrow and when there is a demand for progenitors in regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, gap junctions may not play as important a role in resting adult hematopoiesis and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
