<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> is an established negative prognostic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> but the relationship between its degree and clinical outcome is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, studied the relationship between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 840 consecutive patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, and 504 patients seen at the Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were monitored longitudinally and analyzed by means of time-dependent Cox's proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels lower than 9 g/dL in males (HR 5.56, P=0.018) and 8 g/dL in females (HR=5.35, P=0.026) were independently related to reduced overall survival, higher risk of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, defined as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> below these thresholds, was found to be as effective as transfusion-dependency in the prognostic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After integrating this definition of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> into the WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System, time-dependent regression and landmark analyses showed that the refined model was able to identify risk groups with different survivals at any time during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> through the WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System provides an objective criterion for prognostic assessment and implementation of risk-adapted treatment strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
