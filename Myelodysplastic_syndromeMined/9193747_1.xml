<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients had a median age of 14 years (range 9-17 years) with diagnoses that included ALL in second remission, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in second remission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received a total of 1375 cGy or 1440 cGy given in a hyperfractionated schedule (11 or 12 fractions) over a 4-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were seen in the outpatient clinic daily during TBI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were housed within a 20 mile radius of our institution during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients achieved good control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>emesis</z:hpo> with ondansetron alone while two patients required ondansetron and diphenhydramine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received some form of intravenous hydration during this period (hyperalimentation, fluid boluses in clinic, or night-time intravenous fluids) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient maintained good hydration with oral intake alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one child required admission during this period for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetics</z:chebi> and intravenous fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cost approximation suggests that TBI delivered in the outpatient setting resulted in a saving of approximately $2400 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TBI administered to children and adolescents in the outpatient setting can be a safe and cost-effective practice </plain></SENT>
