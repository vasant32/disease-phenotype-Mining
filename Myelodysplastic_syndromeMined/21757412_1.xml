<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to ascertain the long term outcome of patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment and outcome of 11 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 4 months (range: 3 days-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary clinical manifestation was severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median ANC at diagnosis: 0.2 x 10(9)/L (range: 0-0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirate showed maturation arrest at promyelocyte stage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies revealed 3 mutations, two in ELA-2 gene and 1 in G6PC3 gene, showing a correlation between genotype and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) was the first-line treatment in 9 patients; six of whom showed a good response at doses between 5 and 15 Î¼g/kg/day for 3-7 days/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients failed to respond to G-CSF and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SCT was the treatment of choice in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of the cohort was 5 years (range: 1-10 years) with 100% survival and no cases of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that genetic study is useful for establishing a correlation between genotype and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The treatment of choice for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> is G-CSF to which 2/3 of patients should respond; while SCT is reserved for cases of poor response or those evolving to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>; thus close follow-up of this condition is essential </plain></SENT>
