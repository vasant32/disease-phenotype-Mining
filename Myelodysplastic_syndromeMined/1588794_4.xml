<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and one patient with agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> have been treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo), at the dose of 150 U/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although serum Epo levels were correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in the whole population of patients, they clearly appeared inadequate in some instances, if compared to those of a group of control subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no correlation was found between serum Epo and reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed a partial or complete response to the treatment and the outcome was not correlated with the pre-therapy serum Epo levels; however, serum Epo was less than 100 mU/ml in three of four patients who achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) by which Epo stimulated erythrocyte production in myelodysplastic patients is unclear, because the number of both the reticulocytes and erythroid progenitors remained unchanged during and at the conclusion of a three months' therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to better define the optimal dosage required to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and to clarify rhEpo mechanism of action in these diseases </plain></SENT>
