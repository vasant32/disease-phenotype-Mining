<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is often difficult to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) because of the considerable clinical, cytologic histologic similarities between these two disorders; however, distinguishing between AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is of great importance because there is a higher risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to now, CD34(+) cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA patients have been studied extensively; however, little information is available on myeloid granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes in AA patients was different from that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to assess the immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes in 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 12 with AA, and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the percentages of CD13(+) granulocytes, CD33(+) granulocytes, CD34(+) granulocytes, and HLA-DR(+) granulocytes were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in AA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD15(+) granulocytes and CD10(+) granulocytes were significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in AA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the expression of these markers between patients with AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, the percentages of CD13(+) granulocytes, CD33(+) granulocytes, CD34(+) granulocytes and HLA-DR(+) granulocytes were significantly increased, whereas, the percentage of CD15(+) granulocytes was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes may be a useful parameter for the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
