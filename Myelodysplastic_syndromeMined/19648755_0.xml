<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 85 patients, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were followed up over a period of 23 years at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were analyzed according to the French, American and British Classification </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most subtypes found in patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) in 27 (31.8%) and RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 28 (32.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse prognostic indicators were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> subtype and requirement for blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that MDSs appeared at a younger age and tended to be of the aggressive subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subtype seemed to appear dominantly in men </plain></SENT>
