<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evaluation of MRI perfusion parameters of the lumbar spine in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to determine the vascularisation and anti-angiogenetic effects of thalidomide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 20 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons and 28 MDS patients a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (d-MRI) of the lumbar spine was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the initial d-MRI-investigation 24 of the 28 MDS patients received an anti-angiogenetic therapy with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With an average of 4.2 months after the beginning of therapy a d-MRI-follow-up examination in 9 of these patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitude and exchange-rate constant were calculated and a statistical comparison of these values between healthy persons and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as well as a correlation with the clinical course was executed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed a higher amplitude (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons: 14.4 +/- 5.2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 24.8 +/- 8.1) and exchange-rate constant (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons: 0.124 +/- 0.042, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 0.136 +/- 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 9 MDS patients undergoing thalidomide therapy a reduction of the amplitude and exchange rate constant values was evident in the d-MRI follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically these patients showed a therapy response with complete or partial disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients significantly higher d-MRI parameters can be demonstrated than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under anti-angiogenetic treatment these values decrease in case of a response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, d-MRI seems suitable for the evaluation of anti-angiogenetic therapy effects </plain></SENT>
