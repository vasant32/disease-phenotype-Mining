<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray film showed diffuse infiltrative shadows in the middle and lower lung fields on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infiltrates were prominent in the perihilar regions but less so in the periphery, consistent with a "bat wing pattern." Milky fluid was obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specimens obtained from transbronchial lung biopsy were compatible with the pathological findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> with amorphous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Sciff-positive materials in the alveolar spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impaired function of alveolar macrophages was demonstrated from their abnormally low phagocytosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled latex beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole lung lavage under general anesthesia was done twice, but the patient died because of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
