<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the effect of the blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) concentration on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor in 171 patients who received a continuous infusion of CsA and short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CsA was started at 3.0 mg/kg/day and the dose was adjusted to maintain the blood CsA concentration between 250 and 350 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The actual dose of CsA averaged 1.9 mg/kg/day at the 3rd week after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 29.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient age and sex were identified as independent significant risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CsA concentration during the 3rd week after transplantation most strongly affected the incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (RR 0.995 for an increase in CsA concentration by 1 ng/ml, P = 0.037) adjusted for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was significantly lower in patients with a 3rd-week CsA concentration higher than 300 ng/ml than in those with values between 200 and 300 ng/ml (20% vs. 35%, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the blood CsA concentration at peri-engraftment period may be important in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
