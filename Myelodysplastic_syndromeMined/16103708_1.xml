<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Megaloblastosis (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> transformation of erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow) is the cytomorphological hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> resulting from <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by a finely stippled lacy pattern of nuclear chromatin, which is believed to be an expression of deranged cellular DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular basis of these cytomorphological aberrations still remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current presentation describes the results of our studies on some molecular events associated with the development of megaloblastosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy was used to study megaloblasts as well as DNA fibers extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> and normoblastic bone marrows with and without treatment with proteinase K during the extraction procedure; cellular DNA synthesis in bone marrow cultures was studied by incorporation of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and deoxyuridine suppression test, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> biosynthesis in bone marrow cells was studied by in vitro incorporation of 3H-tryptophan, 3H-lysine and 3H-arginine into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Derangement of DNA synthesis occurred due to an impaired de novo pathway of thymidylate synthesis in both <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin-B12</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-deficient human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001980'>megaloblastic bone marrows</z:hpo> as well as in the bone marrows of rhesus monkeys and rats with experimentally induced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-deficient monkeys developed frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001980'>megaloblastic bone marrows</z:hpo>, but <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-deficient rats did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> changes in the bone marrow of human patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> were not associated with this DNA synthetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biosynthesis of predominantly arginine-rich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001980'>megaloblastic bone marrows</z:hpo> was markedly reduced as compared to normoblastic bone marrows, which was consistently associated with elongation and despiralization of chromosomes and finely stippled nuclear chromatin in megaloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The impaired biosynthesis of predominantly arginine-rich nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> appeared to be a common molecular event (a denominator) underlying the development of megaloblastosis with or without abnormal DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
