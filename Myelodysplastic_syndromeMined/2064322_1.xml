<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> - induced cellular cytotoxicity (MICC) and natural killer- cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) were assessed in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both MICC and NKCC were examined under the same experimental conditions using the 18 hr <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> release assay, except that cultures for MICC were stimulated in vitro by the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' MICC was found significantly reduced, in relation to controls (p less than 0.001), but significantly higher than patients' NKCC (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively), while CD8+ cells and CD16+ cells were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relationship was noted between patients' MICC and total lymphocyte count or any lymphocyte subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eleven patients who were subsequently subjected to a-interferon (a-IFN) administration, MICC values were found within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range one month after the cessation of alpha-IFN, while NKCC values were significantly increased (p less than 0.01), but they still remained below the lower limit of the control (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, did not change after alpha-IFN, but the absolute numbers of CD3+ cells and CD8+ cells were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant rise was noted in CD16+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post- IFN rises in MICC did not correlate with lymphocyte subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients display very low MICC, which can be restored by alpha-IFN administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cause of this disturbance and the mechanism of its restoration by alpha-IFN remain unclear </plain></SENT>
