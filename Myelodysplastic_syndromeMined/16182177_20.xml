<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 60-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to age, 88% of patients had 1 or more adverse biological features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 21 months, 12 patients are alive, 11 of whom are disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of 2-year overall and progression-free survival were 52% and 44%, respectively </plain></SENT>
