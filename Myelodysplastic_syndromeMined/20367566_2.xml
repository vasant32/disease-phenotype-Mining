<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose was increased to 300 microg weekly in non-responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During treatment, 10/17 (59%) transfusion-dependent (TD) and 13/23 (56%) transfusion-free (TF) patients responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In TF patients, Hb increased from 9.2 +/- 0.9 g/dL to 10.3 +/- 1.4 g/dL by 24 weeks (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean response duration was 22 weeks (95% CI: 19.7-24.0) in TF patients compared with 15.1 weeks (95% CI: 13.3-17.5) in TD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was associated with increases in QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreases in the percentage of apoptotic progenitor cells (p = 0.007) and CD34+ cells (p = 0.005) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm previous studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of DPO in anemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biological changes and improvement in QoL were associated with response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate dosing is to be determined </plain></SENT>
