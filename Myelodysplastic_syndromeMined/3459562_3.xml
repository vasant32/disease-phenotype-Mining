<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The blast cells from nine patients with an overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> following a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies as well as by morphological and cytochemical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By integrating the results obtained with these three approaches the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in 6 patients was assessed as myeloid-granulocytic and/or monocytic-, in two as mixed- megakaryoblastic/myeloid- and in one as lymphoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A good correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytochemistry and immunological markers was observed in 7 out of the 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three cases a noteworthy percentage of J5+ cells was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exceptional finding of lymphoid as well as megakaryocytic and myeloid transformations suggests that the target cell for these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> could be a pluripotent stem cell </plain></SENT>
