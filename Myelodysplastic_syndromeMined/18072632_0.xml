<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total DC (Lin1(+) HLA-DR(+)), myeloid DC (mDC) (Lin1(-) HLA-DR(+) CD11c(+)) and plasma DC (pDC) (Lin1(-) HLA-DR(+) CD123(+)) in fresh PB samples of 38 MDS patients and 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were assayed by flow cytometry with the monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40 on these DCs were also assayed in the same way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of total DC in PB of low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls [(33.7 +/- 7.0) x 10(6)/L, (56.3 +/- 29.0) x 10(6)/L vs (12.1 +/- 1.4) x 10(6)/L, respectively] (P &lt; 0.05), that of mDC in PB of low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls too [(16.7 +/- 6.3) x 10(6)/L, (28.7 +/- 17.6) x 10(6)/L vs (5.5 +/- 0.9) x 10(6)/L] (P &lt; 0.05), but pDC in low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was not significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of total DC in PB mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients [(2.37 +/- 0.53)% and (3.58 +/- 1.39)% respectively and that of mDC (0.90 +/- 0.35)%, (1.51 +/- 0.70)% respectively] were higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls [(0.68 +/- 0.08)%, and (0.32 +/- 0.05)% respectively] (P &lt; 0.05), but that of pDC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases was not higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD80 and CD86 between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls had significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total DC and mDC were increased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but pDC did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) except CD40 expressed higher on the DC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
