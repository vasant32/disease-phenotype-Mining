<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it was observed that Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were younger than subjects in Western reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this in mind, the study was conducted prospectively on 52 Indian patients to define chromosomal abnormalities and to understand ethno-geographical differences, if any, underlying the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among this Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed using GTG banding and karyotyped according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was predominant in the age group of 41-60 years (44.23%), with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease was more frequent in males (33 patients, 63.46%) than females (19 patients, 36.53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 48 patients successfully karyotyped, 17 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (35.4%) and 31 patients (64.5%) had a chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were del 5q/-5 in 13 patients (42%), -7/7q- in 10 patients (32.2%), +8 and del 20q- in 6 cases each (19.3%) and i(17)(q10) in 1 patient (3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to these non-random chromosomal abnormalities, some rare abnormalities were also encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was observed in the Chinese population compared to other Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities varied considerably across the different Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in our study was comparable to most Western reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate precisely the ethnic differences in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
