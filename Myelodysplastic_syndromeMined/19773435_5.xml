<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal models, gene expression microarray experiments, and functional studies in cell lines have suggested a potential role for IER3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e>, but, to date, no abnormalities of IER3 at the DNA level have been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe breakpoint cloning of a t(6;9)(p21;q34) translocation from a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), facilitated by conversion technology and array-based comparative genomic hybridization, which revealed a rearrangement translocating the IER3 coding region away from critical flanking/regulatory elements and to a transcript-poor chromosomal region, markedly decreasing expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using split-signal and locus-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes, we analyzed 204 patients with diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> accompanied by clonal chromosome 6p21 abnormalities, and found 8 additional patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with IER3 rearrangements (translocations or amplification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although FISH studies on 157 additional samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-karyotype were unrevealing, and sequencing the IER3 coding and proximal promoter regions of 74 MDS patients disclosed no point mutations, reverse transcription-PCR results suggested that dysregulated expression of IER3 is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (61% &gt;4-fold increase or decrease in expression with decreased expression primarily in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and increased expression primarily in later <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progressing toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), consistent with findings in previous microarray experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support involvement of IER3 in the pathobiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
