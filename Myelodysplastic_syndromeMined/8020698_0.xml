<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The paper is concerned with quantitation and characterization of changes in the immune system of patients suffering from various myelodysplastic conditions (DMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16, CD10, SIg positive cells were quantified in bone marrow and peripheral blood of 35 MDC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 11 patients had refractive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with increased number of blasts (RAIB), 9 had refractive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 5 had RAIB with transformation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 10 refractive cytopenia (RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied in blast transformation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EC-activity was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the MDC patients showed increased number of CD8 lymphocytes in bone marrow and peripheral blood, reduced fraction of CD4 cells in peripheral blood, inhibited proliferation in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RA patients' B-cells expressed lowered surface immunoglobulins in a lesser extent, in a stable killer activity of mononuclears their EC-cell number is decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the above changes RAIB patients exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0001831'>T-cell deficiency</z:mp> in peripheral blood as well as inhibited killer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RAIB transformation progressed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> along with growing T- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002539'>B-cell deficiency</z:mp> and unbalanced proportion of immunoregulatory subpopulations, lower number of relative number of EC-cells </plain></SENT>
