<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase 1 patients received ezatiostat at 5 dose levels (50, 100, 200, 400 and 600 mg/m2) intravenously (IV) on days 1 to 5 of a 14-day cycle until <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, ezatiostat was administered on 2 dose schedules: 600 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 5 or days 1 to 3 of a 21-day treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 54 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2, respectively, chills (11%, 9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> (15%, 2%), flushing (19%, 0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (15%, 0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> (6%, 6%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (0%, 13%), extremity pain (7%, 4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (9%, 4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (7%, 4%) related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infusional hypersensitivity reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of the primary active metabolites increased proportionate to ezatiostat dosage </plain></SENT>
