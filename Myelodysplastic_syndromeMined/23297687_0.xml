<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the incidence/prognostic impact of TP53 mutation in 318 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients, and to correlate the changes to cytogenetics, single nucleotide polymorphism array karyotyping and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 65 years (17-89 years) and median follow-up was 45 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 27-62 months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations occurred in 30 (9.4%) patients, exclusively in isolated del5q (19%) and complex karyotype (CK) with -5/5q-(72%), correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high, TP53 protein expression, higher blast count and leukaemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with mutant TP53 had a paucity of mutations in other genes implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival of patients with TP53 mutation was shorter than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (9 versus 66 months, P &lt; 0.001) and it retained significance in multivariable model (Hazard Ratio 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.3,P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the sequentially analysed samples showed a disappearance of the mutant clone or emergence of new clones, suggesting an early occurrence of TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in mutant clone correlated with response to 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, however clones increased in non-responders and persisted at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adverse impact of TP53 persists after adjustment for cytogenetic risk and is of practical importance in evaluating prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relatively common occurrence of these mutations in two different prognostic spectrums of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, i.e. isolated 5q- and CK with -5/5q-, possibly implies two different mechanistic roles for TP53 protein </plain></SENT>
