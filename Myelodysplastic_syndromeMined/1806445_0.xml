<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The proved effectiveness and relatively low extrahematological toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, Ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> as single agents and in combination in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) are well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study the efficacy and toxicity of an induction combination regimen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, Ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> were evaluated for treatment of poor risk ANLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven poor prognosis ANLL patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, 7 mg/sm days 1-3; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>, 150 mg/sm days 1-3; Ara-C, 200 mg/sm continuous infusion days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age of treated patients was 63 (17-78): 10 de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (4 greater than 65 yrs 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>); 12 secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (5 secondary to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 5 to myeloproliferative syndrome, 2 to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>); 3 relapses; 2 refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (55.5%) achieved CR (8 de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, 3 relapses, 4 secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>); 7 died in induction, 5 progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median remission duration was 27 weeks (range 5-70 wks) and overall median survival 13 weeks (range 4-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extraematological toxicity was low, but five patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and two from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination tested in this trial proved effective in the treatment of "poor risk" ANLL, but the results need to be confirmed on greater numbers of patients, mainly in the group of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that can't be treated with more aggressive regimens </plain></SENT>
