<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selected bone marrow (BM) cells were prepared by the elimination of nylon wool-adherent cells and mature T and NK cells from BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of BM NK progenitors relative to BM cells selected was significantly decreased 4 weeks after the start of rhGM-CSF therapy (P less than .01), while the peripheral blood NK cell count and NK activity were also significantly decreased (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A return to the pretreatment levels was seen 4 weeks after the cessation of treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No suppressive effect was noted in the patients who received rhG-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rhGM-CSF therapy suppresses the generation of NK cells from human BM NK progenitors </plain></SENT>
