<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) entered a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high doses of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients completing the trial were eligible to receive rhEPO as part of an open-label study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were transfusion dependent; 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), and 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A response to rhEPO was defined as an increase in hematocrit of 4 percentage points or more over baseline, or the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transfusions with the hematocrit stable at the baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the double-blind trial, 1 patient (12.5%) receiving rhEPO responded, as compared with no responses in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, responses occurred in 4 of 17 patients (24%) receiving rhEPO at a dose of 1,200 to 1,600 U/kg intravenously (IV) twice weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in granulocyte or platelet counts were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the administration of high doses of rhEPO, toxicity attributable to rhEPO was not observed in either the double-blind or open-label study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response to rhEPO was not significantly related to age, gender, type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, time since diagnosis, time since initiation of transfusion therapy, or baseline serum EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that rhEPO can be administered safely in very high doses to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that 24% of these patients will respond with increased erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
