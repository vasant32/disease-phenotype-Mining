<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this Phase I study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biologic activity and pharmacologic profile of PTK/ZK administered orally, twice daily, on a continuous dosing schedule in patients with primary refractory or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, poor-prognosis de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients for whom PTK/ZK monotherapy was ineffective could receive PTK/ZK combined with standard induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients received PTK/ZK at doses of 500-1000 mg orally b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and pharmacokinetic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were evaluated according to standard bone marrow and peripheral blood criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1000 mg b.i.d., dose-limiting toxicities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>emesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events related to PTK/ZK were dizziness, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo>; these were generally mild and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data showed that steady state was reached by day 14, there was no accumulation with repeat dosing and there was no significant increase in exposure at steady state beyond the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was observed in five of 17 AML patients treated with PTK/ZK combined with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the MTD of PTK/ZK is 750 mg orally b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The drug is generally well tolerated and can be given in combination with chemotherapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
