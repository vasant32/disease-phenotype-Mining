<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the biological characteristics of osteoblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and their supportive capacity for hematopoiesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two-dimensional culture system was constructed by using osteoblasts derived from human marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC); MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and were cultured; the third passage of MSCs were induced into osteoblasts which were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> and confluenced into a feeder layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ficolled bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and seeded into the two-dimensional culture system to culture in vitro without exogenous cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using colony-forming assay, the ability of the two-dimensional system to culture <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytokine expression of osteoblasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient bone marrows in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was detected by RT-PCR and was compared with human osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the osteoblasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients could support short-term survival of GM-CFC in condition without exogenous cytokines, that is, osteoblasts played a crucial role in regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of RT-PCR clearly demonstrated that the osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 expressed SCF, IL-6, SDF-1alpha, G-CSF and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same expression patterns of above cytokines were also seen in osteoblasts derived from BM-MSCs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, but these cells did not express GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the biological characteristics of osteoblasts from bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are generally not different from those of osteoblasts from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both of them can support GM -CFC to form colonies in vitro, it may be associated with expressing important related cytokines by osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
