<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 7 patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic HCT were treated with infusions of donor-derived, ex vivo-expanded CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for tissue-restricted recipient mHAgs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety of T-cell therapy, in vivo persistence of transferred CTLs, and disease response were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular characterization of the mHAgs recognized by CTL clones administered to 3 patients was performed to provide insight into the antileukemic activity and safety of T-cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary toxicity of CTL infusion was seen in 3 patients, was severe in 1 patient, and correlated with the level of expression of the mHAg-encoding genes in lung tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adoptively transferred CTLs persisted in the blood up to 21 days after infusion, and 5 patients achieved complete but transient remissions after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies illustrate the potential to selectively enhance graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> activity by the adoptive transfer of mHAg-specific T-cell clones and the challenges for the broad application of this approach in allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has been registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00107354 </plain></SENT>
