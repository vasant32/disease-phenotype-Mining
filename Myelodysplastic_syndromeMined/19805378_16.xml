<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, recent studies showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-phospholipase (PI-PL)Cbeta1 mono-allelic deletion correlates with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, a single patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor currently used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, displayed a direct correlation between PI-PLCbeta1 gene expression and drug responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we hypothesized that PI-PLCbeta1 could be a target for demethylating therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we analyzed the structure of PI-PLCbeta1 gene promoter, then quantified the degree of PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation and gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at baseline and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, PI-PLCbeta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased in responder patients, along with a reduction of PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the molecular response correlated to and anticipated the clinical outcome, thus suggesting that PI-PLCbeta1 gene reactivation could predict <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate not only that PI-PLCbeta1 promoter is hypermethylated in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but also that the amount of PI-PLCbeta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could predict the clinical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, therefore indicating a promising new therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
