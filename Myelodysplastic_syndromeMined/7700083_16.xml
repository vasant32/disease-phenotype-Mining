<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of the JPN patients was 60 years, about 10 years younger than that in most of the reports based on Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survivals were 65 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 58 months for RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 16 months for RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 10 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>), and 20 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free rates at final observation were 73% for RA, 79% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 24% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 20% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>, and 53% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When low-risk (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) patients were divided into two groups, those 40 years of age and older, and those under 40, the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free rate was 94% for the younger patients (n = 101), compared with 66% for the older patients (n = 318) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors for survival were different from those in Western reports, i.e., variables representing quantitative abnormalities (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, granulocyte, and platelet counts) were not major prognostic factors, while variables representing qualitative abnormalities (morphological abnormalities in granulocytic and megakaryocytic series cells) were highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two scoring systems for overall survival and for leukemic transformation were developed, based on multivariate prognostic factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither system included variables representing the degree of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whatever the reason for the different prognostic factors in JPN and Western <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the use of a scoring system based on Western patients for clinical decision-making in a JPN patient could be misleading, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
