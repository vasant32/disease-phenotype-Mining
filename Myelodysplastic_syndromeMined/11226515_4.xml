<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with complete remission (CR), the frequency of blasts with AAE (%AAE) by CD45/side scatter (SSC) gating was significantly higher than that by the traditional forward scatter (FSC)/SSC combination (median, 4.1 vs. 0.3%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated two representative cases, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse could be predicted before 3 weeks and the early treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> could be performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this procedure is very useful for the evaluation of the quality of CR </plain></SENT>
