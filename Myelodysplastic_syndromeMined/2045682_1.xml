<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) represent clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell that are associated with quantitative and qualitative disturbances of the peripheral blood cells and a high risk for the transition to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) are bone-marrow-derived cells, we were interested to see whether they are altered in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidermal sheets were prepared from biopsies taken from the thighs of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and five control persons and processed for immunoperoxidase staining of CD1a antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The density and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of CD1a+ cells (i.e., LC) was evaluated by visual assessment as well as automatic image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of LC was reduced in seven of nine patients (range, 30-75% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), whereas the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of LC appeared to be altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in that the LC displayed large and bizarre cell bodies with only a few and often abnormally long dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HLA-DR expression by LC was not altered, as shown by double immunofluorescence staining of CD1a and HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, LC again appeared enlarged and often presented with bizarre nuclei, yet displayed no other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that LC are abnormal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and might even indicate a more wide-spread involvement of the dendritic cell lineage in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
