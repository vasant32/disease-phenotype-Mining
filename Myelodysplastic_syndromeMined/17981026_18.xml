<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the cumulative incidence of and the risk factors for developing second malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (SMN) in children and adolescents following treatment for relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (1376) up to 18 years of age with first relapse of non-B-cell ALL were treated and achieved a 2nd complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment followed trial protocol in five consecutive multicentre trials of the ALL-REZ BFM Study Group between March 1983 and December 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SMN was analysed, correlated with clinical and therapeutic parameters, and compared to the age-specific incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> as cited in German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 1376 patients 21 were diagnosed with SMN including non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=6), osteo-/Ewing's-/fibroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (n=4), B-cell ALL/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> (n=1 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall cumulative risk of SMN at 15 years (median follow-up of 13.1 years) was 1.26%+/-0.38% (SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SMN was found to be significantly associated with stem cell transplantation (SCT), and high cumulative doses of cranial irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>) and cyclophophamide (CY) were found to be independently associated with SMN (p=0.047 and 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in the age-matched population, there was a 10-fold increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite repeated exposure to intense frontline and relapse treatment (including multiagent chemotherapy, cranial irradiation and stem cell transplantation in some patients) the cumulative incidence of SMN was unexpectedly low, though significantly higher than in the general age-matched population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association of SMN to SCT seemed to be a secondary effect at least partially mediated by exposure to high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> and CY given for conditioning therapy </plain></SENT>
