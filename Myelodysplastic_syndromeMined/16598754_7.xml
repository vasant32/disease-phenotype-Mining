<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although soluble CD40 (sCD40) is a potential modulator of both antitumor responses and CD40-based therapies, the levels and significance of sCD40 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated serum/plasma sCD40 levels using an enzyme-linked immunoassay in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of sCD40 were elevated in serum (&gt;1.697 ng/mL) or plasma (&gt;0.649 ng/mL) from 73% of patients with CLL, 80% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 40% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 43% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 33% of patients with MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of patients with MM demonstrated that elevated sCD40 was a significant, independent predictor of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, sCD40 was a significant prognostic factor when the interaction of age and sCD40 was included as a variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis demonstrated that elevated sCD86 levels were associated with significantly shorter survival only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients younger than age 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Release of sCD40 by CLL cells was induced by cross-linking with CD40 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> have elevated circulating levels of sCD40, and these elevated levels are associated with a poor prognosis at least in patients with MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, suggesting that sCD40 may have a role in modulating antitumor responses and also may be a useful prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the findings suggested that further studies will be required to determine the effect of circulating sCD40 on the clinical effectiveness of CD40-ligating reagents used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
