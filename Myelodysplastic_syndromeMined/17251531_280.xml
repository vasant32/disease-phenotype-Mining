<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> resulting from chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> are at high risk for difficult-to-treat and often fatal invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter study involving evaluators who were unaware of treatment assignments, we compared the efficacy and safety of posaconazole with those of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> as prophylaxis for patients with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received prophylaxis with each cycle of chemotherapy until recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and complete remission, until occurrence of an invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e>, or for up to 12 weeks, whichever came first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of proven or probable invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> during treatment (the primary end point) between the posaconazole and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> groups; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause and time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were randomly assigned to receive posaconazole, and 298 patients were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (240) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proven or probable invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> were reported in 7 patients (2%) in the posaconazole group and 25 patients (8%) in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> group (absolute reduction in the posaconazole group, -6%; 95% confidence interval, -9.7 to -2.5%; P&lt;0.001), fulfilling statistical criteria for superiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly fewer patients in the posaconazole group had invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> (2 [1%] vs. 20 [7%], P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly longer among recipients of posaconazole than among recipients of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment were reported by 19 patients (6%) in the posaconazole group and 6 patients (2%) in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> group (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal tract disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, posaconazole prevented invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> more effectively than did either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> and improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were more serious adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment in the posaconazole group </plain></SENT>
