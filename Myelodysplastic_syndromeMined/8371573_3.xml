<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, they usually had no or only moderate cytopenias; 63% of them had marrow blasts &lt; 5%; only 1 patient had circulating blasts; 60% had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>); 19% of the 43 patients who were karyotyped had an abnormal clone, and only 2 patients had complex cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 4 of the 63 patients progressed to another FAB type within 5 yr of diagnosis, from RA to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 yr, 9 patients showed progression (including progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other patients remained stable (43 cases) or died from cytopenias or unrelated disorders (11 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for 3 patients who achieved prolonged complete remission with intensive chemotherapy, and possibly 3 patients who responded to low dose Ara C, prolonged survival seemed to result mainly from the low natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although, as expected, significant differences for age, cytopenias, circulating and bone marrow blasts, and karyotype were seen between short (&lt; 2 yr) and long (&gt; 5 yr) very few significant differences were seen between intermediate and long survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These 2 subgroups only differed by significantly lower age and higher <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level in long survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate scoring systems (Bournemouth, Sanz's and Lille scores) proved of relatively limited value in differentiating them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
