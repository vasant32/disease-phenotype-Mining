<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had been previously treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, 29 for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and three for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1709246" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonneoplastic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of the cases presenting in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in one to 12 months (median, 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 49% of the cases was not readily classified according to French-American-British (FAB) criteria; the primary difficulty in classification related to the involvement of multiple cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the cases that could be classified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FAB types were represented except for M1; M2 was the most frequent type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in marrow specimens from 22 of 24 (92%) patients studied with G banding; 11 had abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was four months with no significant difference between those treated and not treated with antileukemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was three months for the patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, six months for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and four months for the patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that did not evolve to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings in the present study suggest that there are three stages of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">panmyelosis</z:e>: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with associated myelodysplastic changes, (2) a frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and (3) overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many patients will present in the stage of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that differs from de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> primarily by the high incidence of trilineage involvement, difficulty in classification, frequent cytogenetic abnormalities, and poor response to antileukemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The myelodysplastic phase, with or without evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, is a highly lethal disease with a median survival comparable to that of the patients who present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
