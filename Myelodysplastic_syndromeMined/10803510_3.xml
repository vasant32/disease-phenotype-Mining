<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to begin to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes involved in these disorders, we performed a detailed microsatellite allelotype of chromosomal deletions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNAs from both bone marrow and peripheral blood of 32 MDS patients were studied using 84 highly informative microsatellite markers on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> autosomal arms, excluding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> of the acrocentric chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified on chromosome 5q (40% of informative cases), 7q (45%), 17p (23%) and 20q (20%), which corresponds to the most common cytogenetic abnormalities reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a high incidence of LOH (&gt; or =20%) was observed on chromosomal arms which had not been previously reported including 1p (36%), 1q (35%), and 18q (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This extensive allelotype analysis focuses attention on several novel genomic regions that probably contain novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes whose loss of function contributes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
