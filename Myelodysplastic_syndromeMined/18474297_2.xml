<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on two patients with a known history of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) with bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the classic B-CLL cytogenetic abnormalities in one of the patients, both showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone in their bone marrow specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a BioView Duet automated scanning system, which allowed us to combine histology with fluorescence in situ hybridization, we showed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clone was restricted to the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that this finding signifies the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (de novo or therapy related), rather than progression of B-CLL with the occurrence of a new clone, and that in general, it has implications for the finding of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in CLL </plain></SENT>
