<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLPA detects abnormalities in multiple loci simultaneously, with higher resolution and throughput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood from 50 healthy subjects was used to establish probe-specific reference ranges, increasing MLPA sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MLPA was then performed on 110 FISH-tested blood or bone marrow samples from suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our novel MLPA analysis system combined maximum stringency with sensitive detection of low-frequency abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accuracy/specificity of MLPA were excellent compared to FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our MLPA analysis/interpretation method provides a clinically robust, high-throughput, high-resolution option for detection of abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
