<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess this relationship, we evaluated 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) patients who underwent ABMT at out institution and had evaluable serial cytogenetic studies before and after ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (57%) showed no chromosome aberrations after ABMT in any of the studies performed, while 13 patients (43%) carried abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight out of 30 patients (27%0 the abnormal karyotype after ABMT was associated with hematologic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic abnormalities were: (1) the same as at diagnosis without additional abnormalities in five patients; (2) the same as at diagnosis but with additional abnormalities in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient a different karyotype from that of diagnosis was detected and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was clinically evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, occasional and single cell chromosome abnormalities were observed in four patients (13%), none of whom relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The new and additional clonal cytogenetic abnormalities observed after ABMT were found in eight patients (27%), suggesting that this event may not be so frequent, that is presumably associated regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The re-appearance of the chromosome aberrations after ABMT and the relationship with the risk of relapse are discussed </plain></SENT>
