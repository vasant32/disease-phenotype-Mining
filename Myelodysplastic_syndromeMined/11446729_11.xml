<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution were analyzed retrospectively in a total of 180 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (observation period: 1989-1999; median age: 71; range 27-93; f/m ratio: 1/1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were established according to FAB criteria (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, n=37; RA, n=53; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, n=50; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, n=19; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, n=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six different multiparameter scoring systems (the Mufti, Aul, Sanz, Morel, and Toyama scores, and the international prognostic scoring system [IPSS]) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Aul, Sanz, and Mufti scores were applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 180 patients, Morel and Toyama scores to 109 patients, and the IPSS to 102 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As assessed by multivariate analysis, the percentage of bm-blasts, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, platelet count, neutrophil count, LDH, and karyotype were found to be independent single variables for survival, and bm-blasts, neutrophil count, platelet count, and karyotype for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> prognostic scoring systems applied appeared to be highly predictive for survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest predictive values were found for the Aul, Sanz, and Toyama scores for overall survival, and the IPSS, Toyama, and Morel scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data show that scoring systems are useful for predicting overall and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-free survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Karyotype-based multiparameter systems appear to be particularly effective in defining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who are at high risk of transforming to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
