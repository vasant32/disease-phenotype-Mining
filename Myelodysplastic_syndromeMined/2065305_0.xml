<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (EL;<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M6</z:e>), preceded by a myelodysplastic phase, in a 50-year-old male 8 years after treatment for Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow at time of diagnosis of EL revealed three cell lines: 1) 28 of 53 cells (53%) were hypodiploid, 43,XY,-5,-7,-12; 2) 23 of 53 cells (43%) were near-triploid, stemline 67-69,XY,+2,del(5)(q11.2),+del(5)(q11.2),+6,-7,+8,-9,-11,-12,+15,-16,der (17)t (17;?) (p11.2;?),-18,-20,-20,+22,+r, + mar (relative to a complete triploid cell); 3) 2 of 53 cells (4%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46,XY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> of 5, 7, and 12 in both abnormal lines suggest that the near-triploid line evolved from the hypodiploid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single hypodiploid cell with both del(5) and der(17) chromosomes that appeared identical to those in the near-triploid line suggests that polyploidization occurred after these structural rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While EL is not characterized by any well-defined structural abnormality, reported cases are frequently hypodiploid, with occasional cases of polyploidization, as in our patient, EL in adults without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or recognized mutagenic exposure has been shown to have loss or deletion of chromosomes 5 and 7, also characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patient had a relative lack of chromosomes 5 and 7 in both abnormal clones, as well as a del(5)(q11) in the near-triploid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case of EL clearly demonstrates the evolution of a complex near-triploid line from a hypodiploid line, with chromosome abnormalities typical of both EL and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
