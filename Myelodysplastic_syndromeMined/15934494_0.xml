<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized these synergistic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim [Leukine]), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> to treat elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a single-institution, retrospective study, we evaluated 94 treatments with concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, and GM-CSF between the years of 1997 and 2003 in high-risk elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 80% of patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the GM-CSF doses; 78% of patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event was neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, which was noted in 57% of patients </plain></SENT>
