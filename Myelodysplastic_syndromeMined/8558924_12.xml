<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cell lines and samples from 27 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were infected by a recombinant adenovirus expressing beta galactosidase gene (Ad RSV betagal) and efficacy of transduction assessed by evaluating betagal expression in cells with a histochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the cells at a multiplicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (MOI) of 200 p.f.u./cell, the percentage of beta <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>-positive cells after 48h was high in two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K562 (64%) and RPMI 8226 (a <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line, 65%), relatively large in the two <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines tested (41% and 20%, respectively) and in MT4 (an adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line, 38%) and low or absent in other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fresh samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, CLL, NHL, <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, no betagal positive cells were seen 48h and 72h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, except in one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and one case of CLL (where 10% and 2% of betagal positive cells were seen after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of fresh malignant cells to GM-CSF before and during adenoviral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, in three cases, did not increase the number of transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that adenoviral vectors, at least in their present form, cannot efficiently be used for direct gene transfer in hematological malignant cells </plain></SENT>
