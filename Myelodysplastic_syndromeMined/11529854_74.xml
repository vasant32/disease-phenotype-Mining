<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> ameliorates cytopenias including induction of trilineage responses in approximately 50% of patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the incidence and kinetics of cytogenetic responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 115 successfully karyotyped patients, 61 (53%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major cytogenetic responses were observed in 19 patients (31% of those with abnormal cytogenetics, 17% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by intention-to-treat) after a median of three courses (range, 2-6) until best cytogenetic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressive decrease of the abnormal clone over time was also determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median duration of cytogenetic responses was 7.5 months (range, 3-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of response by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic risk groups revealed three out of five cytogenetic responses (60%) in the IPSS 'low-risk' group, 6 out of 30 with 'intermediate risk' (20%) and 10 out of 26 in the 'high-risk' group (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival in these cytogenetic subgroups was 30, 8 and 13 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients achieving a major cytogenetic response was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.88) compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persisted (P = 0.0213) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, repeated courses of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> induce cytogenetic remissions in a substantial number of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with pre-existing chromosomal abnormalties; these are associated with improved survival compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with 'high-risk' chromosomal abnormalities may particularly benefit from this treatment </plain></SENT>
