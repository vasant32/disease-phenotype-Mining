<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The higher level of resolution of single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping may be used to find cryptic abnormalities and to precisely define the topographic features of the genomic lesions, allowing for more accurate clinical correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed high-density SNP-A karyotyping at diagnosis for a cohort of 1,155 clinically well-annotated patients with malignant myeloid disorders. results: We identified chromosome 5q deletions in 142 (12%) of 1,155 patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> segments (UPD) in four (0.35%) of 1,155 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with deletions involving the centromeric and telomeric extremes of 5q have a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> phenotype and additional chromosomal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions not involving the centromeric or telomeric extremes of 5q are not exclusive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> but can be associated with other less aggressive forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, larger 5q deletions are associated with either del(17p) or UPD17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 31 of 33 patients with del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, either a deletion involving the centromeric and/or telomeric regions or heterozygous mutations in NPM1 or MAML1 located in 5q35 were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the extent of the affected region on 5q determines clinical characteristics that can be further modified by heterozygous mutations present in the telomeric extreme </plain></SENT>
