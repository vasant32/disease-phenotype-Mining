<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was first described as a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and more recently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, allotransplant outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with MK has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 79 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who underwent allotransplant at the University of Iowa from 1990 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recorded patients' cytogenetic data, clinical characteristics and evaluated outcome following allogeneic stem cell transplant stratified by cytogenetic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 79 patients, 37 (47%) had unfavorable karyotypes (23 complex karyotype, 25 abnormal chromosome 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (30%) had MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (30%) relapsed and 59 (74.7%) died during study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with MK had higher 2-yr relapse incidence (RI) (51% vs. 29%; P = 0.01), lower 2-yr event-free survival (EFS) (8% vs. 40%; P = 0.02), and lower 2-yr overall survival (OS)(6% vs. 41%; P = 0.02) than patients without MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further analyzed the effect of MK in each unfavorable karyotype composite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the outcome was not statistically different, unfavorable karyotypes with patients with MK showed a trend toward higher 2-yr RI [hazard ratio (HR), 1.7; P = 0.34], lower 2-yr EFS (HR, 1.5; P = 0.29), and lower 2-yr OS (HR, 1.5; P = 0.28) compared to unfavorable karyotypes without MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic abnormalities remain an important prognostic factor for allotransplant outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested poor allotransplant outcomes with high RI and low OS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with MK </plain></SENT>
