<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-11 regulate hemopoiesis and LIF, OSM, and IL-6 also inhibit the proliferation of myeloid leukemic cell lines through the signal-transducing subunit gp130 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These IL-6-type cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell culture supernatants (SN) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) and monocyte-depleted MNC of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA; n=12) and healthy individuals (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AZA down-regulated OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 release by MNC of patients but not by MNC from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient's SN had significantly lower concentrations of LIF, OSM, and IL-11 than SN of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When monocyte-depleted MNC of patients were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin a significant increment in OSM levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, monocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in healthy subjects did not cause any significant change in OSM values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (a) AZA inhibits the release of OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 exclusively in RA-diseased MNC, (b) Patient's MNC release subnormal amounts of LIF, OSM, and IL-11, and (c) RA-derived monocytes probably down-regulate OSM release by phytohemagglutinin-activated MNC </plain></SENT>
