<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the treatment response and disease progression in strictly selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (IST), patients were required to have an international prognostic scoring system [corrected] (IPSS) score ≤ 1.0 and at least one of the following conditions: (1) expression of the HLA-DR15 allele, (2) bone marrow (BM) cellularity of less than 30%, and (3) abnormal immune index of BM T-lymphocytes.The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ≥ 5% marrow myeloblasts, (2) poor karyotype, and (3) diagnosis of concurrent nonhematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received antithymocyte globulin followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) or CsA alone for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one cases were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total response rate was 77.5% (55/71 cases) with 11 complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate was positively correlated with the number of recruitment criteria met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with an abnormal CD8, an abnormal CD4, or both had similar response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who responded to treatment had significantly lower Th1 and Tc1 levels after treatment (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively), and six of eight patients with abnormal chromosomes did not show obviously abnormal clonal expansion when reassessed after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the median observation period of 24 months, only two cases exhibited disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the median observation of 24 months, 35 of 55 responders (63.6%) maintained a hematological response, and 60 of 71 patients (84.5%) were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strictly selective use of IST may yield high response rates and can avoid treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IST significantly reduces Th1 and Tc1 levels without causing malignant clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
