<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a chromosome study of 83 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 50 showed a clonally abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities were the whole or a partial loss of the long arm of chromosome 7 (-7 or 7q-) (14 patients) and a partial loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with 5q- and/or -7 or 7q- had a shorter survival (median, 5 months) than those with other abnormal karyotypes (22 months) or those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (28 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this series 30 patients were examined cytogenetically on two or more occasions during the course of their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients showed a further karyotypic alteration from the initial findings, and, concomitantly, their disease progressed in severity including overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients had a shorter survival (median, 2 months) after the chromosome reanalysis than the other 20 patients who did not have further karyotypic changes (21 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be predicted more accurately by reanalyzing the chromosomes after the initial analysis </plain></SENT>
