<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, 9 out of 13 patients (69%) in the high blast group achieved hematologic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After Bestatin treatment, intrinsic hematopoietic stem cell abnormalities as well as hematologic findings were markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The success of Bestatin therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> led us to investigate the clinical activity of Bestatin in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and Bestatin combination therapy resulted in complete hematologic remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most exciting result was the suppression of the Philadelphia chromosomes among the responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete cytogenetic response was obtained in 3 patients (21%), partial cytogenetic response in 1 (7%), and minor cytogenetic response in 5 (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the majority of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients achieved significant cytogenetic response with sustained Ph1 negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are very encouraging and warrant further studies </plain></SENT>
