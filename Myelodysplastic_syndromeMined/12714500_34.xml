<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to evaluate the true impact of HLA-mismatch by using recent data from a homogenous population, excluding HSCT procedures that used graft manipulations, and by considering genotypic matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of 2947 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were extracted from the database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were survival and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of serologic HLA-mismatch, higher age, and high-risk disease were identified as independent risk factors for both shorter survival and the development of grade III to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of HLA-mismatch on survival was more relevant in standard-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings persisted when we used genotypic HLA matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival after one-locus-mismatched HSCT was equivalent to that after HLA-matched unrelated HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that when a one-locus-mismatched family donor is available for high-risk patients, immediate HSCT using this donor is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In standard-risk patients, however, survival after one-locus-mismatched HSCT is significantly shorter than that after HLA-matched HSCT, and the indications for HSCT should be considered carefully </plain></SENT>
