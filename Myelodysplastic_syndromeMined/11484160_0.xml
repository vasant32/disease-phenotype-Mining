<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) in the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7)or deletion of long arm of chromosome 7(7q-) in the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied simultaneously by conventional karyotype analysis and interphase FISH technique using SpectrumRed directly labeled DNA specific probe for 7q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred interphase cells were analyzed for each case and the cells with one red hybridization spot&lt;7% were regarded as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and it is more sensitive than CC </plain></SENT>
