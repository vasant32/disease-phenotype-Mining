<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several candidate genes which were differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were selected and confirmed in expanding samples by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction after clustering and bioinformatics analysis. one of these genes, RAP1GAP, was found to be expressed at a significantly higher level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in comparison with those suffering from other hematopoietic diseases including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose that over-expression of RAP1GAP gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
