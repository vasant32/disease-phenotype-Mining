<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon review of pretreatment material, seven of the 25 cases (28%) were considered to represent myeloproliferative and reactive conditions other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 18 cases, 17 (94%) were reclassified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included one case of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), three of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), four of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>), and nine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (CMMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haematological findings in these 17 patients were compared to those in 50 randomly selected patients with Ph1-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas an absolute basophilia in the peripheral blood was a nearly constant feature in the Ph1-positive group, it was lacking in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in the pattern and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 25 cases studied was considered morphologically and clinically indistinguishable from Ph1-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that Ph1-negative <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> constitutes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of prognostically distinct disorders and that, in most instances, careful morphologic examination will permit precise classification </plain></SENT>
