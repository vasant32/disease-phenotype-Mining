<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate whether the abnormalities observed on femoral marrow magnetic resonance images are related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The findings on magnetic resonance images of the femoral marrow were evaluated over periods of 1 to 92 months (median, 18 months) in 42 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images were obtained by the T1-weighted spin echo method and the short T1 inversion recovery technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images showed that the femoral marrow patterns changed from fatty, faint, or nodular to scattered or uniform as the disease progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was observed in only 13 patients whose marrow exhibited a scattered or uniform pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of the 29 patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern was significantly shorter than that of the 13 patients with a fatty, faint, or nodular marrow pattern (10.7% v 73.3% at 7 years; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival was also significantly shorter in the patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern versus a fatty, faint, or nodular pattern (37.7% v 100% at 7 years; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance images of the femoral marrow can provide valuable information for assessing the prognosis and determining the most appropriate management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
