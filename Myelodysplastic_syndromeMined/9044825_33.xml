<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We identified a fusion between ETV6 on 12p13 and MDS1/EVI1 on 3q26 in a t(3;12)(q26;p13) found in two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting chimeric transcript consists of the first two exons of ETV6 fused to MDS1 sequences, which in turn is fused to the second exon of the EVI1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that MDS1 can be expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues both as a single gene and fused to EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ETV6 does not contribute any known functional domain to the predicted fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, bad prognosis, and relative complex karyotype are in agreement with observations made in other cases of t(3;12)(q26;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a comparison can be made with the formation of an AML1/MDS1/EVI1 fusion gene in translocations (3;21)(q26;q22) </plain></SENT>
