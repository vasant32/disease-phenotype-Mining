<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a feasibility and toxicity pilot study of escalating activity of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three activity levels were fixed--30 MBq/kg (0.8 mCi/kg), 45 MBq/kg (1.2 mCi/kg) and 56 MBq/kg (1.5 mCi/kg)--and 13 patients enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week before treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent dosimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ASCT was performed 13 d after Zevalin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients engrafted promptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in terms of haematological toxicities were observed among the three levels, apart from a delayed platelet recovery in heavily pretreated patients receiving 56 MBq/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-haematologic toxicity was mainly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and liver toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died 4 months after treatment because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 2 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high-activity Zevalin with ASCT is feasible and could be safely delivered in elderly and heavily pretreated NHL patients, including those who previously received high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maximum tolerated dose was not clearly defined according to dosimetry and clinical toxicities, and further studies are needed to confirm the toxicity profile and evaluate efficacy </plain></SENT>
