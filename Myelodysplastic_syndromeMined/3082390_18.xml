<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with sideroblasts (defined according to the revised French-American-British classification with less than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow) were analyzed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against leukocyte antigens on B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral blood an increased proportion of T lymphocytes (and correspondingly a decreased proportion of B cells) could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, when expressed in terms of absolute numbers, the T cell component was depressed because of severely decreased numbers of T4+ helper cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the absolute numbers of T8+ suppressor cells were either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in markedly decreased ratios of T4+/T8+ cells, which were closely correlated to the number of transfusions given to the patients because of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients exhibited decreased numbers of cells reactive with the N901 natural killer (NK) antibody, thus explaining our earlier finding of decreased NK activity in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow increased proportions of myeloid cells reactive with monoclonal antibodies present on immature myeloid cells (My7 and My9) were found, suggesting the presence of malignant clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when the numbers of My7+ cells and the morphologic evaluations of bone marrow smears at the time of diagnosis were compared to the progression of the disease, a group of patients with high numbers of My7+ cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> could be identified that had a high probability of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts or to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of antibodies defining leukocyte differentiation antigens might be of significant value in the diagnosis and prognostication of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of this potentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> with special emphasis on possible defects in the immunologic defense mechanisms against early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
