<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quantification of bone marrow (BM) blasts by cytomorphology is essential for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to its subjectivity and the potential impact of dysplastic features on accurate identification of blast cells, more objective approaches are required, multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) being a particularly promising approach in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no consensus exists about the optimal combination of markers and strategy to be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BM blast counts from 74 MDS patients were evaluated by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> versus four different MFC phenotypic criteria: "CD34⁺", "CD34⁺ and/or CD117⁺", "CD34⁺, and/or CD117⁺ HLA-DR⁺", and "CD34⁺ and CD117⁺ HLA-DR⁺ plus CD64⁺ CD14(-/lo) " cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each criterium, the percentage of blasts was calculated using either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BM nucleated cells or non-erythroid CD45⁺ cells as denominator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: The number of "CD34⁺ and/or CD117⁺ HLA-DR⁺"cells showed the highest correlation and agreement with morphological counts, only a minor proportion of cases being misclassified by MFC vs. <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> for the &gt;5% and &gt;10% classification thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In turn, a CD34⁺ phenotype was insufficient to correctly identify and quantify blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, usage of non-erythroid BM cells as denominator, or inclusion of "CD34⁺ and/or CD117⁺ HLA-DR⁺ plus CD64⁺ CD14(-lo") cells were both associated with overestimated blast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of "CD34⁺ and/or CD117⁺ HLA-DR⁺" cells (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated BM cells) by MFC is an efficient method for the enumeration of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, caution should be taken with replacing <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> by MFC blast counts; its combined use may rather provide complementary information increasing the accuracy and reproducibility of BM blast cell counts in these patients </plain></SENT>
