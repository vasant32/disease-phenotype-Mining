<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete response was achieved by low-dose ara-C therapy, but he relapsed 15 months later, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and 13.0% myeloblasts in normocellular marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was treated unsuccessfully with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, metenolone, and 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He then developed life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and was treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF Filgrastim; 125 micrograms/day s.c.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> resolved and, interestingly, he achieved a partial response, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell counts and only a few dysmyelopoietic cells in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> progressed when rhG-CSF administration was tapered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the dose was increased again, leukemic blasts were found to proliferate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When rhG-CSF was discontinued, blasts rapidly decreased in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis revealed a complex abnormality during the first relapse, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46,XY karyotype during the partial response, and recurrence of the same complex abnormality during leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stimulation index of marrow mononuclear cells cultured with rhG-CSF increased with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that rhG-CSF initially stimulated the selective proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoietic cells, but the evolution or selection of a leukemic clone responsive to rhG-CSF appears to have occurred subsequently </plain></SENT>
