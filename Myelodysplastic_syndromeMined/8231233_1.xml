<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were investigated using in vitro colony assay of bone marrow cells and chromosome analysis of single colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The result was compared with conventional cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chromosome abnormalities included were 5q-, +8, -7, 11q-, -Y and one complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colony formation was reduced in eight patients, while the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic examination of single colonies showed that both chromosomally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal stem cells had colony forming ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cytogenetically abnormal colonies varied between 25 and 100% of analysed colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No further clones than those found in direct cytogenetic analysis were revealed after in vitro growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with a 5q- abnormality and one patient with a -7 abnormality showed a significantly lower proportion of cytogenetically abnormal colonies than the proportion of abnormal cells in the direct bone marrow chromosome preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with a +8 abnormality showed a growth advantage of the +8 clone in comparison with the chromosomally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clones, but this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients a chromosomally changed stem cell gave rise to both erythroid and myeloid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The FAB-class did not seem to influence the growth of either chromosomally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal colonies </plain></SENT>
