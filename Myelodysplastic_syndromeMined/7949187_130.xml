<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the prognostic value of p53 mutations for response to chemotherapy and survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene, and confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A p53 mutation was found in 16 of 107 (15%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 20 of 182 (11%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 9 of 81 (11%) CLL tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, three of nine (33%) mutated cases and 66 of 81 (81%) nonmutated cases treated with intensive chemotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) (P = .005) and none of five mutated cases and three of six nonmutated cases treated by low-dose Ara C achieved CR or partial remission (PR) (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial survival was 2.5 months in mutated cases, and 15 months in nonmutated cases (P &lt; 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who received chemotherapy (intensive chemotherapy or low-dose Ara C), 1 of 13 (8%) mutated cases and 23 of 38 (60%) nonmutated cases achieved CR or PR (P = .004), and median actuarial survival was 2.5 and 13.5 months, respectively (P &lt; 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CLL, 1 of 8 (12.5%) mutated cases treated by chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and/or CHOP and/or fludarabine) responded, as compared with 29 of 36 (80%) nonmutated cases (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CLL cases, survival from p53 analysis was significantly shorter in mutated cases (median 7 months) than in nonmutated cases (median not reached) (P &lt; 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 35 of the 45 mutated cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and CLL, cytogenetic analysis or SSCP and sequence findings showed loss of the nonmutated P53 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that p53 mutations are a strong prognostic indicator of response to chemotherapy and survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The usual association of p53 mutations to loss of the nonmutated P53 allele, in those disorders, ie, to absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, suggests that p53 mutations could induce drug resistance, at least in part, by interfering with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoptotic pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
