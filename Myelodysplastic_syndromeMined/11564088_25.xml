<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data concerning the impact of such disparity on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD, relapse or overall survival are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective multicentre study was performed on 215 HLA-A2-positive patients who received an HLA-identical sibling SCT, in order to determine the differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD incidence on the basis of the presence or absence of the HA-1 antigen mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival and overall survival were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected 34 patient-donor pairs mismatched for HA-1 antigen (15.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD occurred in 51.6% of the HA-1-mismatched pairs compared with 37.1% of the non-mismatched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate logistic regression model showed statistical significance (P: 0.035, OR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.07-8.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the two groups for grades III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD, disease-free survival or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed the association between HA-1 mismatch and risk of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD, but HA-1 mismatch was not associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD and did not affect relapse or overall survival </plain></SENT>
