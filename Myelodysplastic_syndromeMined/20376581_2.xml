<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequencies with low concentrations of serum Hp (&lt;42 mg/dL) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients (98.0%) were significantly higher than those in AA (27.8%; P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (38.5%; P &lt; 0.0001) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In AA patients, white blood cell (WBC), absolute neutrophil, and platelet counts were significantly decreased in the group (n = 15) with low concentrations of serum Hp than in that (n = 39) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentrations of it, and WBC counts were positively correlated with concentrations of serum Hp, suggesting that WBC counts may affect the concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and serum iron were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in the group (n = 20) with low concentrations of serum Hp than in that (n = 32) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentrations of it, and the values of serum iron were inversely correlated with concentrations of serum Hp, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> may affect the concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low concentrations of serum Hp had Coombs-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> determined by immunoradiometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, several factors in conjunction with pathophysiology contribute to decrease of serum Hp in BMF </plain></SENT>
