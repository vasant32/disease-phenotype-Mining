<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An 82-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of severe normocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001895'>normochromic anemia</z:hpo> (Hb 5.6 g/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The white cell count was 9,200/microliters with marked basophilia (34.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (19.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> also revealed both basophilia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, with blast contents of 9% </plain></SENT>
