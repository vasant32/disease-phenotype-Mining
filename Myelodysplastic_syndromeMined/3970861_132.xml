<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>141 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were classified according to the FAB criteria and followed up for a period of 4-192 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was recognized that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e> had a uniformly poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was a wide variation in survival among the other subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A score of 1 was assigned to each of the following presenting haematological features: bone marrow blasts greater than or equal to 5%, platelets less than or equal to 100 X 10(9)/l, neutrophils less than or equal to 2.5 X 10(9)/l and Hb less than or equal to 10.0 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore the score for each patient ranged between 0 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between those patients who scored 0 or 1, or between those who scored 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore patients were put into three groups: Group A (score 0 or 1), Group B (score 2 or 3), Group C (score 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in survival between each of the three groups are highly significant (P less than 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This system further separates patients with RA, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> into good and bad prognostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study also confirms that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to cytopenias are more common than those due to transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of this scoring system in conjunction with the FAB criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should serve as a prognostic tool on which to base treatment </plain></SENT>
