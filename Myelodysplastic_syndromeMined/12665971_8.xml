<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients treated for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) develop treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) caused by MLL gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether these patients are unusually susceptible to anti-topo II drugs, or whether this is a random adverse event is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To discover genetic polymorphisms that may predispose patients to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development, we sequenced the 8.3-kb MLL breakpoint cluster region (BCR) from 22 patients who had been treated with topo II inhibitors and who developed t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and from 37 patients who did not, and from eight infants and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four polymorphic sites within Alu repetitive elements were identified; three affected the length of poly-A tracts and one altered the size of a trinucleotide repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three poly-A tract polymorphisms occurred with equal frequency in leukemic patients and controls and hence are not predictors of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trinucleotide GAA repeat has three alleles: (GAA)4, (GAA)5, and (GAA)6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The (GAA)6 allele is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adult t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients are almost exclusively (GAA)4/5 heterozygotes (83%), whereas the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population is only 55% (GAA)4/5 heterozygotic and is represented equally by (GAA)4 and (GAA)5 homozygotes (20% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only certain trends could be established because of the small sample size of these leukemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas adult t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients are more likely to be (GAA)4/5 heterozygotes, this is not statistically significant, and this polymorphism within the MLL BCR has only a suggestive association with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
