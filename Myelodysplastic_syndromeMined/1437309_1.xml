<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An evident cytoplasmic positivity with FVIII and UEA-I was encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological specimens, whereas the immunolocalization of CD31 was limited to megakaryocytes present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow biopsies or in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No immunostaining with QBEND/10 was observed in any case, although the most selective staining of endothelial cells of bone marrow vessels was noted with this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The usefulness to utilize endothelial markers in order to identify atypical and immature forms of megakaryocytes as well as micromegakaryocytes, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> by the aid of CD31, was also discussed </plain></SENT>
