<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we used Cox modelling to compare these strategies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> treated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group of the EORTC or at the MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were aged 15-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 184 EORTC patients received conventional dose ara-C + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> for remission induction, and after one consolidation course, were scheduled to receive an allograft, or an autograft if a sibling donor was unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 215 MDA patients received various high-dose ara-C containing induction regimens, and in CR, continued to receive these regimens at reduced dose for 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR rates were 54% EORTC and 63% <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five of the 100 EORTC patients who entered CR received a transplant in first CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival in patients achieving CR was superior in the EORTC cohort, the 4-years DFS rates were 28.9% (s.e. = 4.8%) EORTC vs 17.3% (s.e. = 3.7%) <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival from CR was not significantly different in the EORTC and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> groups, as was survival from start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After accounting for prognostic factors the conclusions were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite various problems with the analysis discussed below, the data suggest that neither transplantation nor chemotherapy, as currently practised, can be unequivocally recommended for these patients in first CR and that questions as to the superior modality may be less important than the need to improve results with both </plain></SENT>
