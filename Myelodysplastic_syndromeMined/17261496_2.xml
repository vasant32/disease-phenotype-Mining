<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FAB subtypes of the patients included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dosage of CsA was 3 to 6 mg/kg per day and was adjusted according to the blood concentration of CsA and the responses of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered twice a day for more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of treatment, hematological improvement was observed in 18 of 32 patients (56.3%) by the criteria of the International Working Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up (median time, 14 months), 4 patients showed alteration of disease progression, including 1 complete remission and 3 partial remissions, and 16 patients showed hematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 20 responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 62.5% (20/32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the CsA therapy was effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and both hypo- and hyperplastic bone marrows might respond to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival time was significantly longer in responders than in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study shows that CsA therapy is potentially the most effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
