<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At doses of supplements shown to be optimal for colony formation in cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, myeloid (day 14) colony numbers were subnormal in 10 of 14 MDS marrows cultured in 5637CM and in 8 of 14 cultures containing rhGM-CSF (2.5 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a high dose of rhGM-CSF (20 ng/ml) raised myeloid colony numbers in cultures of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows, so that 9 of 14 now yielded colonies within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range; increased levels of 5637CM failed to do this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colony growth was poor in 13 of 14 MDS marrow cultures supplemented with erythropoietin in addition to 5637CM or rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of rhGM-CSF did not increase erythroid growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that myeloid progenitors from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone may have a decreased responsiveness to hemopoietins which can be overcome at high concentrations of growth factors </plain></SENT>
