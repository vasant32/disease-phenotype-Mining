<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 590 patients who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HSCT at our institution, and on whom a pretransplantation serum ferritin was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An elevated pretransplantation serum ferritin level was strongly associated with lower overall and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroup multivariable analyses demonstrated that this association was restricted to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); in the latter group, the inferior survival was attributable to a significant increase in TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend toward an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> in patients with high ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results argue that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> plays an important role in transplantation outcome for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as it does in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
