<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was carried out on 140 cases of therapy related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (TRL) caused by bimolane (BML) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> from 1984 to 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This series of BML-TRL consists of 90 male and 50 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>87.1% of them were from 20 to 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual incidence varied from 4 to 24 cases, and was maintained at this level through the period from 1986 to 1991 without any declining tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average time interval between BML administration and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was 46 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>138 cases were diagnosed as ANLL and 2 cases were suspected of having ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subtype frequency was shown as follows: M3 &gt; M2 &gt; M5 &gt; M4 &gt; M1 &gt; M6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>67.1% of the patients had a low peripheral white blood cell counts (&lt; 5 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>116 patients received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 26.7% remission rate was obtained with 18.1% complete remission and 8.6% partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A 115 day median survival was calculated through a follow up survey of 95 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we concluded that: (1) This has been the largest group of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-therapy-related-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients ever reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is characterized by a shorter latent period, higher remission rate less incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and more frequent occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, as compared with other types of TRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BML is supposed to be a strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-causing cytotoxic agent </plain></SENT>
