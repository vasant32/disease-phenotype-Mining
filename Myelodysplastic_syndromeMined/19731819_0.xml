<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Results of chromosomal karyotypes of 351 adult patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-seven cases (67.5%) had karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 99 (41.7%) were numerical, 70 (29.5%) were structural, and 68 (28.8%) were complex abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, among the 237 patients with chromosomal abnormalities, 130 (54.8%) showed single abnormality, 54 (22.8%) double abnormalities and 53 (22.4%) complex abnormalities (&gt; or = 3 two independent aberrations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases (1.7%) were multiploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> or of chromosomal arm anomaly were detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 46 chromosomes and the aberrations in frequent order were +8, -20/20q-, -7/7q-, -5/5q-, -18, -11/11q-/, +21, -Y, -21, -10, -16, -22, +9, del(12)(p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of -5/5q- (5.1%) was lower in our series than in western countries (8.7% -23.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> was even less (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of +8 (19.1%) and -20/20q- (9.4%) were higher in our series than in western countries (1.2% -7.0%, 2.0% -3.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosome translocations were detected in 31 cases (13.1%), including 12 novel translocations that have not been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, i(17)(q10) was detected in 9 cases (3.8%) of which 6 were simplex abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal duplication presented in 7 cases (3.0%) with 4 cases involved chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to IPSS chromosomal prognostic classification, the incidence of poor-risk karyotypes was increased in the advanced WHO subtypes (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The follow-up data were available in 177 patients with a median follow-up duration of 14.5 (1-131) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median OS was 36 [95% confident interval (CI) 25-46] months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to IPSS chromosomal prognostic classification, the median OS of patients with good, intermediate and poor-risk cytogenetic subgroup were 51 (95% CI 25-77), 35 (95% CI 5-65) and 13 (95% CI 9-17) months, respectively (P = 0.004) and for NN-AN-AA karyotype classification, the median OS of NN, AN and AA were 51 (95% CI 24-78), 36 (95% CI 0.3-71) and 23 (95% CI 10-35) months, respectively (P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The features of chromosomal abnormalities in Chinese patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> shows some difference from that in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis is of great importance to predict prognosis and to tailor individualized therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
