<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we evaluated the prognostic impact of TET2 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frameshift, nonsense, missense mutations, or defects in gene structure were identified in 22 (22.9%) of 96 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-31.3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutated and unmutated patients did not significantly differ in initial clinical or hematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS was 76.9% (95% CI, 49.2%-91.3%) in mutated versus 18.3% (95% CI, 4.2%-41.1%) in unmutated patients (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival was 89.3% (95% CI, 63.1%-97.0%) in mutated versus 63.7% (95% CI, 48.2%-75.4%) in unmutated patients (P = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis (Cox proportional hazard model), the absence of TET2 mutation was associated with a 4.1-fold (95% CI, 1.4-12.0-fold) increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and transfusion requirement, the presence of TET2 mutation remained an independent factor of favorable prognosis (hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.6-16.3; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that TET2 mutations observed in approximately 20% of patients, irrespective of the World Health Organization or French-American-British subtype, represent a molecular marker for good prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
