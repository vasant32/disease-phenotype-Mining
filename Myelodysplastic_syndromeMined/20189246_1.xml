<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the Western countries the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is mostly observed in patients older than 65 years and therefore there are few reports referring to patients less than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to emphasize for the first time the characteristics of this group of age in Romania, a non-Western European country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases belonging to the group of age under 50 years were extracted from the database of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registry of the Hematological Department, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania, comprising 403 primary adult cases collected between 1982 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The registration form, using the FAB classification, was kindly provided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Foundation (USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological parameters were compared with those aged over 60 years and with those reported by other foreign studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases aged under 50 years, representing 16% in the registry, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 19 cases (28.3%) were under 30 years, and the overall average age was 36 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A female and urban predominance, as well as very low values for the age-adjusted incidence (0.07/100,000) and its temporal trend (slope value 0.0098 Â± 0.002) characterized this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The temporal trend was significantly lower than that of the over 60, but similar with that of the 51-59 years group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates a higher proportion of young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Romania than in the Western countries, but lower than in the Asian ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in adults aged under 50 years, and even under 59 years, could be a distinct category with a mostly inborn pathogeny compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
