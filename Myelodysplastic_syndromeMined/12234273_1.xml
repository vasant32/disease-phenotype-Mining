<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received PBSCT, and 24 received BMT between January, 1995 and March, 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL; n = 22), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 3), or other diseases (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median ages of patients in the PBSCT and BMT groups were 9 yr and 6 yr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> was used as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) prophylaxis regimen in the PBSCT group, whereas CsA alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone was used in the BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating lymphocyte numbers and subpopulations determined by flow cytometric analysis were used as markers of immune recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the PBSCT group, the median number of harvested CD34+ cells was 7.25 (range: 1.3-27.6) x 106/kg of the recipient's body weight, while the median number of harvested nucleated cells was 4.7 (range: 3.7-10.5) x 108/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myeloid engraftment occurred sooner after PBSCT than after BMT (median number of days to achieve absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) &gt; 0.5 x 109/L; 11 and 15, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) and similar results were found for platelet engraftment (median number of days to achieve a platelet count of &gt; 20 x 109/L; 12 and 21, respectively; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, after PBSCT the absolute numbers of total circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations were not significantly different from those after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD after PBSCT was the same as that after BMT, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD developed more frequently after PBSCT than after BMT (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a pediatric population, the indications for PBSCT and BMT should be based on these findings in addition to regard for the donor's safety </plain></SENT>
