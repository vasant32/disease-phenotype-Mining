<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) were used to treat 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who relapsed within 4 months of treatment with partially mismatched related donor (PMRD) BMT representing 1-2 HLA-mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No other form of cytoreductive therapy was given to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients developed GVHD (grade II-III) following DLI requiring steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients went into complete remission following development of GVHD and immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood showed increased numbers of CD3+/CD8+ T cells, CD56+/CD8+ lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and CD16+/CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells expressing intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor P75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the response was of short duration and the patient relapsed 8 weeks later ultimately resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient did not show any response to DLI and died of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in conjunction with active GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DLI from PMRD carries a high risk for the development of GVHD and may have an anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect for relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-leukemic effect from PMRD DLI may be mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, LAK cells and NK cells </plain></SENT>
