<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylations within N- and C-terminal degrons independently control the binding of cyclin E to the SCF(Fbw7) and thus its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now determined the physiologic significance of cyclin E degradation by this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the construction of a knockin mouse in which both degrons were mutated by threonine to alanine substitutions (cyclin E(T74A T393A)) and report that ablation of both degrons abolished regulation of cyclin E by Fbw7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cyclin E(T74A T393A) mutation disrupted cyclin E periodicity and caused cyclin E to continuously accumulate as cells reentered the cell cycle from quiescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the cyclin E(T74A T393A) mutation greatly increased cyclin E activity and caused proliferative anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cyclin E(T74A T393A) mice exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0000245'>abnormal erythropoiesis</z:mp> characterized by a large expansion of abnormally proliferating progenitors, impaired differentiation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This syndrome recapitulates many features of early stage human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cells also proliferated abnormally in cyclin E knockin mice, and the cyclin E(T74A T393A) mutation delayed mammary gland <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath>, implicating cyclin E degradation in this anti-mitogenic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperproliferative mammary epithelia contained increased apoptotic cells, suggesting that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> contributes to tissue homeostasis in the setting of cyclin E deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall these data show the critical role of both degrons in regulating cyclin E activity and reveal that complete loss of Fbw7-mediated cyclin E degradation causes spontaneous and cell type-specific proliferative anomalies </plain></SENT>
