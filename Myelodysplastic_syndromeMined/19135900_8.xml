<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Identification of genomic lesions in progenitor cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) could lead to the discovery of new disease-specific genes and may be of prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a genome-wide mapping of DNA from CD34+ cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high-resolution 500K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and a concomitant integration with global gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Copy number and loss of heterozygosity analyses detected heterozygous deletions on chromosomes 2, 9, 13, 16, 17, and 20 ranging in size from 0.1 megabases (Mba) to 2.1 Mba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, numerous regions with significant <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Integration of the genomic data with gene expression analysis showed that genes, which were downregulated at least 1.5-fold in regions of significant deletion and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> were exclusively downregulated in those samples displaying the aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomics and gene expression data were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and variable number tandem repeat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-density genomic mapping of CD34+ bone marrow cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> identifies cryptic genetic lesions and offers new opportunities for the discovery of target genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by integration with gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
