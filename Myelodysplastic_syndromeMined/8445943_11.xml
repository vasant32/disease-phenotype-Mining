<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurological toxicity occurred in 8/219 patients treated with fludarabine (FAMP), 30 mg/m2 per day and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), 0.5 g/m2 per hour for 2-6 hours for 5 days, for new or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed severe, progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> that was ultimately fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This toxicity was similar to that seen with high-dose fludarabine therapy and was limited to patients with serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> &gt; or = 2.0 mg/dl and age over 60 years, occurring in 2/9 such patients compared to 0/210 among the other patients (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since FAMP is partially excreted by the kidney, toxicity in these two patients was likely due to receiving an effectively high dose of FAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> but there was no association with age, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, dose of Ara-C, or number of courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A patient, who also received intrathecal Ara-C, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this dose rate and duration of Ara-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> rarely arises, and cerebral toxicity is not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither toxicity was observed in 481 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients treated with FAMP alone, by the same dose and schedule, suggesting that combination with Ara-C is important for the development of at least the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of neurotoxicity with FAMP/Ara-C is low especially in comparison with high-dose Ara-C therapy (3 g/m2 over 2 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral toxicity can likely be decreased by dose reduction of FAMP in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased creatinine</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> decreased by detailed neurological examination before courses of FAMP/Ara-C </plain></SENT>
