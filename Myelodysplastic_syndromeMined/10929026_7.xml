<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analysed T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable region (TCRAV) and T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region (TCRBV) repertoires in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 34 recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), seven of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and 19 of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using the quantitative microplate hybridization assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCR usage skewed at an early period (6-7 weeks) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The change was more apparent in allogeneic recipients than in autologous recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, a predominant increase was detected in the frequency of VA1-4 (26%, 11 of 41 recipients), VA3-1 (32%) and VB24-1 (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, acidic amino acid residues frequently followed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> in complementarity-determining region 3 of BV24S1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further examined the extent of skew using samples obtained at serial time points after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The normalization of skewed repertoires occurred over a long period of time (&gt; 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the rate of normalization of skewed TCR repertoires between adult and child recipients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that these T cells may have expanded in response to allogeneic antigens, such as miHA (minor histocompatibility antigen), and that altered repertoires are eventually normalized by T-cell regeneration via a thymic-dependent pathway in children </plain></SENT>
