<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV is present in these cells in a latent state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA in these cell lines was analysed by Southern blot hybridization, using a set of cloned EBV DNA fragments from the EBV strain B95-8 as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A common spectrum of highly related but distinguishable EBV DNA restriction enzyme sequences was found, suggesting some genomic diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propagation of the cells in long-term culture revealed a gradual decrease of EBV copies per cell in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines with some minor changes in the restriction pattern of the EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that human precursor monocyte cells may be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by EBV </plain></SENT>
