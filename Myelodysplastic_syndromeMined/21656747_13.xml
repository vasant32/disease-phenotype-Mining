<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the AZA-001 trial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (75 mg/m(2) /d subcutaneously for Days 1-7 of every 28-day cycle) demonstrated improved survival compared with conventional care regimens in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System-defined intermediate-2- or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and World Health Organization-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with 20% to 30% bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This secondary analysis of the AZA-001 phase 3 study evaluated the time to first response and the potential benefit of continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> treatment beyond first response in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 91 of 179 patients achieved a response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>; responding patients received a median of 14 treatment cycles (range, 2-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median time to first response was 2 cycles (range, 1-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although 91% of first responses occurred by 6 cycles, continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> improved response category in 48% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Best response was achieved by 92% of responders by 12 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time from first response to best response was 3.5 cycles (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-6.0) in 30 patients who ultimately achieved a complete response, and 3.0 cycles (95% CI, 1.0-3.0) in 21 patients who achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> therapy in responders was associated with a quantitative increase in response to a higher response category in 48% of patients, and therefore may enhance clinical benefit in patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
