<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 47.5 (range 18-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients received a combination of Rubidazone and Ara C and 1 received High dose Ara C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 5 (17%) were treatment failures (F) and 10 (35%) died during therapy induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median disease free survival was 8.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival of the whole population was 6 months from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment, and 17 months in patients achieving CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were significantly less favorable than those obtained at our institution in de novo ANLL with the same chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant prognostic factors of treatment outcome emerged but patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic findings seemed to have both a higher CR rate and longer remissions than patients with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients under 50 did not have higher CR rates than older patients, although they had longer remissions (with 3 out of 6 CRs exceeding 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, treatment outcome and survival were identical in patients treated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase and in those treated after progression to ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy is a highly toxic approach in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and essentially seems to benefit younger patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, in whom some long remissions can be obtained </plain></SENT>
