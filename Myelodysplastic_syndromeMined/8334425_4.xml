<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the value of additional immune suppression in BMT conditioning regimens in 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> allografted between 1984 and 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose of 6 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) was delivered to 12 of 24 and 15 of 25 patients conditioned with 10 Gy and 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients also received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MP) before BMT to enhance immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in immunosuppression between the TBI with or without TLI or MP regimens and the influence of different levels of graft T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were measured in terms of transplant rejection, and complete versus mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment-related complications were evaluated in terms of GVHD and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall transplant rejection rate was 6% (3 of 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete chimerism was not significantly modified by increasing the TBI dose or by additional TLI (p &gt; 0.10) but was more often seen in patients receiving MP given as pre-transplant immunosuppressor booster (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GVHD was only influenced by the level of T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 49 patients received a TBI lung dose in the range 9.5-10 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A crude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> range of 19% (9 of 47 evaluable patients) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither the addition of TLI, MP nor the T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> influenced the lung toxicity rate (p &gt; 0.10) but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> was more frequent in patients with GVHD (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
