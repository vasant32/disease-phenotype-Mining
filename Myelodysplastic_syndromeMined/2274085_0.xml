<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myeloid blast cells were collected from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and from the livers of fetuses aborted in the second trimester of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that the alveolar macrophages (AM) produced sufficient amount of colony-stimulating activity which culminated in the fourth week of in vitro cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media from AM supported the growth of multipotential blast cell colonies (GEMM-CFU) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while in fetal hemopoiesis macrophage colonies preponderated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with human interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can abrogate the production of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Media conditioned by AM were not able to compensate for cell-to-cell contact in long-term cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blast cells but CSFs released from AM in vivo can contribute to aggravation of the disease </plain></SENT>
