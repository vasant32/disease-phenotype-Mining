<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 14 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype before culture, abnormal karyotypes were detected first in LTBMC from seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Novel abnormal karyotypes were observed after LTBMC in two of four cases which had had both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal karyotypes before culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotypes were also newly detected in four of five cases with only abnormal karyotypes before culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 13 cases in which abnormal karyotypes were observed during the cultures, three patients showed the same karyotypes 1-11 months later in their clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that our LTBMC might be useful for evaluating the prognosis and choice of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
