<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the characterization of a new human kinesin-like protein, Rabkinesin6 (RAB6KIFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The composite cDNA sequence is 2957bp, and encodes a protein of 890 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 100kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has high homology (93% similarity) with the mouse kinesin-like protein, Rab6kifl, indicating that it is the human homologue of the mouse gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RAB6KIFL has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the structural characteristics required to function as a microtubule-associated motor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the mouse gene which is ubiquitously expressed, RAB6KIFL expression appears to be tissue specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is widely expressed in fetal tissues, abundantly expressed in adult thymus, bone marrow and testis, and is expressed at low levels in heart, placenta and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RAB6KIFL gene is mapped to human chromosome 5, band q31, spans approximately 8.5kb of genomic DNA, and contains 19 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RAB6KIFL maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> characterized by a deletion of 5q; however, we detected no mutations of RAB6KIFL in malignant myeloid disorders with loss of 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The description of this human kinesin-like protein may provide a better understanding of the diversity of this large family of proteins </plain></SENT>
