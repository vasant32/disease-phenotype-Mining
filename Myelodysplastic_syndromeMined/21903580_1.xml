<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used two erythroid models, murine erythroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells and erythroid burst-forming unit-derived erythroblasts, to show that 5-aza-CdR induced erythroid differentiation and increased the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech), thereby increasing iron uptake and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified new regulatory E-boxes that lie outside of CpG islands in the TfR1 and Fech promoters, and the methylation status of these sites can be altered by 5-aza-CdR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This in turn altered the binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to these promoter elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5-aza-CdR promoted the nuclear translocation of c-Myc and its binding to Max to form functional complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coordinated actions of 5-aza-CdR on the methylation status of the target genes and in stimulating the nuclear translocation of c-Myc provide new molecular insights into the regulation of E-boxes and explain, at least in part, the increased erythroid response to 5-aza-CdR treatment </plain></SENT>
