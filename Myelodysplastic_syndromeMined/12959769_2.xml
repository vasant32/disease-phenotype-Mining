<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this process has been associated with the pathogenesis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the bone marrow of HIV-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies from 28 HIV-positive patients were immunostained for factor VIII and the microvessel density (MVD) was quantitatively evaluated and compared with that of 32 biopsies from patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to 18 control bone marrows from patients with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow MVD in HIV-positive patients was similar to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, both groups revealed significantly higher MVD counts compared to those of control bone marrows (MDF vs controls P=0.022, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> vs controls P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow from HIV-positive patients with MDF reveals similar microvessel counts compared to those with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, although both differ significantly from that of control bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in HIV-positive patients, may provide further insights into the pathobiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and might be of value for the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease </plain></SENT>
