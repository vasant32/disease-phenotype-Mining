<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite treatment with azanucleoside induction, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> nearly always relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be curative, but it is risky </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given that azanucleosides affect human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte reactivity, we conducted a retrospective study to define the impact of pre-HCT azanucleoside therapy on post-HCT donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving azanucleoside induction therapy achieved rapid and high levels of donor chimerism post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lineage analysis also found rapid donor chimerism of lymphocyte and granulocyte subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate the feasibility of pretransplant azanucleoside therapy in patients who subsequently receive an HCT </plain></SENT>
