<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regulatory genes, as well as the percentage of apoptotic and S phase cells and to correlate the findings with clinical characteristics and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, classified according to FAB (17 RA, five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 19 RAEB, nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>, ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) and WHO (ten RA, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e>, 11 RAEBI, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBII</z:e>, ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found increased expression of anti-apoptotic bclxL and mcl1 genes and decreased expression of p21 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found increased expression of anti-apoptotic mcl1 gene in patients with higher than Intermediate-1 IPSS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that combined expression of apoptotic caspases 8, 3, 6, 5, 2, 7, and Granzyme B was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding cell cycle regulatory genes expression, we demonstrated increased expression of cyclin D1 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> Increased combined expression of cyclins B, C, D1, and D2 was found in patients with cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two pathways seem to be interconnected as shown by the positive correlation between CDKs 1, 2, 4, p21 and the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and positive correlation between apoptotic caspase 3 expression and the percentage of S phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study showed altered expression of genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and increased expression of cyclin D1 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
