<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case the AML1/MTG8 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>) fusion transcript was not detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the rearrangement of the AML1 gene locus was not detected by Southern blot nor pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses using specific probes for the AML1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study using cosmid probes for 21q22 revealed that the breakpoint of 21q22 was telomeric to the AML1 gene locus and centromeric from D21S259, 351, 3421 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first report concerning the t(8;21)(q22;q22) carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> (de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) to show that the breakpoint at 21q22 is located outside the AML1 gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also noteworthy that the cell-surface antigen expression pattern of the bone marrow (BM) blasts was changed from CD7+ CD2+ CD13+ CD33+ CD19- CD11b+ CD14+ CD36+ to CD7- CD2- CD13+ CD19+ CD11b- CD14- CD33+ CD34+ CD36- CD56+ during leukaemic progression, and the pattern in leukaemic phase was similar to the characteristic phenotype of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases with t(8;21), when the AML1/MTG8 fusion transcripts are always detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
