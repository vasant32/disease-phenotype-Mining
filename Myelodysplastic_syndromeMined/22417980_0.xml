<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: in older persons, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is associated with a number of unfavourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In approximately 30% of older persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical differences between subjects with explained and unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and investigated whether these subjects have different mortality patterns compared with subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: observational prospective follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: the Leiden 85-plus study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: four hundred and ninety-one persons aged 86 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the study population was divided in three groups: (i) no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (reference group, n=377), (ii) explained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100502'>vitamin B12 deficiency</z:hpo>, signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, n=74) and (iii) unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality risks were estimated with Cox-proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in subjects with explained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> than in subjects with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increased risk for mortality was observed in subjects with explained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> [HR: 1.93 (95% CI: 1.47-2.52), P&lt;0.001], but not in subjects with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> [HR: 1.19 (95% CI: 0.85-1.69), P=0.31] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusted analyses (sex, co-morbidity, MMSE, institutionalised and smoking) did not change the observed associations for both explained and unexplained anaemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: older subjects with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> had similar survival compared with non-anaemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased mortality risks were observed in subjects with explained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> compared with non-anaemic subjects </plain></SENT>
