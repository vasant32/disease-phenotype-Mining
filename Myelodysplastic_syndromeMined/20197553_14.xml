<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APC is located in a commonly deleted region on human chromosome 5q, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), suggesting that haploinsufficiency of APC contributes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the hematopoietic system of mice with the Apc(min) allele that results in a premature stop codon and loss of function showed no abnormality in steady state hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow derived from Apc(min) mice showed enhanced repopulation potential, indicating a cell intrinsic gain of function in the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Apc(min) bone marrow was unable to repopulate secondary recipients because of loss of the quiescent <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that Wnt activation through haploinsufficiency of Apc causes insidious loss of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> function that is only evident in serial transplantation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide a cautionary note for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>-expansion strategies through Wnt pathway activation, provide evidence that cell extrinsic factors can contribute to the development of myeloid disease, and indicate that loss of function of APC may contribute to the phenotype observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and del(5q) </plain></SENT>
