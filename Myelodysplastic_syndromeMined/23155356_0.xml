<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 49 Japanese patients with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) were followed up for 5 years after treatment with a definitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and the effects of genotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were retrospectively revaluated in terms of prediction of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU at 400 mg/m(2)/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 and 8, and radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1 to 5, 8 to 12, and 15 to 19, with a second course repeated after a 2-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VEGF genotypes -1498T/C, -1154G/A, -634C/G, -7C/T, 936C/T, and 1612G/A were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate was 46.9% (23/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 42.9 % (21/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 7 patients with a CR, but survival of less than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (N=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> after suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (N=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> that developed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (N=1), factors not specified (N=2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153382" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oropharynx cancer</z:e> (N=1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153349,C0558353" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tongue cancer</z:e> (N=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF -634C/G had no effect on clinical response, but long-term survival depended on the genotype (p=0.033, Fisher's; p=0.038, Cochran-Armitage; p=0.079, Log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequency of 7 patients with a CR, but survival of less than 5 years was different from that for the other 42 patients (p=0.032, Fisher's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the other 5 genotypes evaluated affected either clinical response or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEGF -634C/G is possibly predictive of long-term survival after treatment with a definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies with a larger number of cases are needed to clarify the effects of this genotype </plain></SENT>
