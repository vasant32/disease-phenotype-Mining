<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using MS-PCR method, the methylation status of Id4 gene was detected in 50 patients with different subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Id4 methylation was also detected in bone marrow samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> which served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that Id4 gene was unmethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of bone marrow samples from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In various subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the rate of Id4 gene methylation was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No Id4 methylation was found in 6 cases of RA, 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and 4 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Id4 methylations was found in 2 out of 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Id4 methylation in 3 out of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBI</z:e> and other 3 out 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEBII</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In groups with blast ratio lower or higher than 5%, the incidence of Id4 gene methylation were 6.7% and 30% respectively, so that there was significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In tentative conclusion, Id4 gene methylation possibly is found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with higher ratio of blast cells </plain></SENT>
