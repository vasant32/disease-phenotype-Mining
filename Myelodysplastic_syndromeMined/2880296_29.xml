<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study which blood-cell lineages are affected by the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>, we used chromosome 7-specific DNA probes in Southern blotting experiments on DNA derived from specific cell fractions isolated from the blood of five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As judged by the presence or absence of two different alleles for restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, lymphocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients were shown to have two different chromosomes 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes were affected by the chromosomal abnormality in four patients (No. 1, 2, 4, and 5) and unaffected in one (No. 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemotaxis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Patient 3 and impaired in Patients 4 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monocytes were affected by the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> in two of three patients (No. 2 and 3) and mainly unaffected in one (No. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the granulocytes and monocytes were affected differently in different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mature blood cells are derived from abnormal progenitors and that there may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the involvement of different cell lineages in different patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is an association between DNA loss and functional impairment </plain></SENT>
