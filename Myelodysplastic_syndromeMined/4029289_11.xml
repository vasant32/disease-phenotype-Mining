<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human fibroblastoid cell strains obtained from primary bone marrow cultures and continuous stromal cell lines recently derived from mouse bone marrow were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of fibroblastoid precursors (CFU-F) varied considerably in human bone marrow samples, and no differences could be detected between marrows from a group of myelodysplastic patients (age range 70-82 years) and groups of age-matched controls or younger individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lack of direct correlation between initial clonogenicity and ultimate capacity of fibroblastoid cells to grow in continuous culture was observed in both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the myelodysplastic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clonogenicity of CFU-F in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, some of these marrows failed to grow when subcultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> fibroblastoid cells at 10(4) per culture exhibited myelopoietic activities when cocultured with fresh bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At higher concentrations, these cells inhibited myeloid colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibroblastoid cells from only one out of four myelodysplastic patients examined exhibited comparable inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the inhibitor(s) was demonstrated by the lack of effect of fibroblastoid cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow on the clonogenicity of mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, human foreskin fibroblasts were devoid of such inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These functions of cultured stromal cells may correlate with some of their activities in the bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
