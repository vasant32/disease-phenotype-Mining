<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We conducted a single-institution phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of combination chemoimmunotherapy followed by radioimmunotherapy consolidation and rituximab maintenance as front-line treatment in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with intermediate- to high-risk follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 patients with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of 4-6 cycles of FM (fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 28-day cycle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol was amended after enrolling the first 4 patients to include rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6-8 weeks, responders received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) followed by maintenance rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly Ã— 4 doses, repeated every 6 months for 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After R-FM, the overall response rate was 95% with a complete response rate (CR) of 45% (n = 10), a partial response (PR) rate of 50% (n = 11), and stable disease in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan with a 60% conversion rate of PR to CR, resulting in an improved CR of 79% (n = 15) and a PR of 21% (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients proceeded to rituximab maintenance resulting in 3 patients with PR converting to CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At median follow-up of 49.6 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 47.2 months and median overall survival (OS) was not reached in an intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse effects were hematologic, with 2 patients experiencing treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), evolving to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: R-FM with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation and rituximab maintenance is well tolerated, improving CR rates and maintaining durable responses in patients with untreated indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
