<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses according to the FAB classification were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) in 3, RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) in 5, RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 14, REAB in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) in 5, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) in 3 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the small number of patients does not allow statistical evaluation, our results are similar to those in the literature: prognosis is less good with an increasing number of marrow blasts and degree of cytopenia, and the risk of progression to ANLL is higher for REAB-t and REAB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 4 patients treated with small doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), one responded and remained stable without treatment for 7 months </plain></SENT>
