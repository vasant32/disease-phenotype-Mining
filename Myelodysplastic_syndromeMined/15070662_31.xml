<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomized phase 3 trial, patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 91) or elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 43) were randomized to receive 2 induction courses consisting of ARA-C (2 g/m2 days 1 through 5) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim, 5 microg/kg) during and after chemotherapy with or without fludarabine (25 mg/m2, days 1 through 5) (FLAG versus AG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consolidation consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (45 mg/m2, days 1 through 3) and ARA-C (200 mg/m2, days 1 through 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) rate following AG was 65% versus 71% with FLAG (P =.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 24 months was 24% for AG treatment and 39% for FLAG (P =.32) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grades 3 to 4 neurotoxicities were more often reported in the FLAG arm (14% versus 3%, P =.03), whereas no significant differences in other toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
