<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a causative relationship of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to the progenitor's defective clonogenic growth has not been sufficiently demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and its contribution to ineffective hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, by assessing the differential clonogenic capacity of purified "apoptotic" and "non-apoptotic" bone marrow progenitors in a short-term semisolid culture system </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-apoptotic as well as apoptotic CD34+ cells gave similar patterns of growth, both defective compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of "apoptotic" CD34+ cells to proceed in colony formation as well as the abnormal growth of "non-apoptotic" progenitors are probably pointing towards the need to reconsider the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the defective clonogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
