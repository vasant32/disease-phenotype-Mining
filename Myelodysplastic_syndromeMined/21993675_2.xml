<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although lenalidomide is very effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with 5q deletion (del 5q), concerns have been raised over the fact that this drug could trigger progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-five transfusion-dependent patients with lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with del 5q were treated with lenalidomide (10 mg/day, for 3 weeks every 4 weeks); six (6.3%) of the patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cohort of 95 lenalidomide-treated patients was compared to a historical control cohort of 99 patients with lower risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with del 5q who never received lenalidomide, using a propensity score approach that can control for potential confounders in non-randomized comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 4-year estimated cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was 9% in patients treated with lenalidomide and 15.8% in controls who did not receive lenalidomide (P=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a propensity score approach, we found no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> progression and survival from diagnosis between the cohort treated with lenalidomide and the control cohort </plain></SENT>
