<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism of the effects of HMBA on myeloid leukemic cells remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of HMBA on cell cycle and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell were investigated in order to explore its pharmacological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The altered distribution of cell cycle and expression of its regulatory proteins (cyclin D, cyclin E and p27) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-6 0 cell induced by HMBA were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects on transcription for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of CKI p15, p16 and p27 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell were further studied by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HMBA could mainly commit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell to G0/G1 arrest and the significantly decreased endocytic cyclin E protein and increased cyclin D/p27 protein after HMBA treatment were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no expression of p15, p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell and 3 mmol/L of HMBA could make them expressed after exposed for 24 h or 48 h respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of p27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was positive and no obviously different in untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells exposed for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that one of the pharmacological mechanisms of HMBA was to elevate the expression of p27 and reduce the cyclin E expression as well as to activate the expression of p15, p16 gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, that arrested cell at G0/G1 and exerted its effects of anti-proliferation </plain></SENT>
