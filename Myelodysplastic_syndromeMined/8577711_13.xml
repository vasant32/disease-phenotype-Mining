<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AML1 (CBFA2), which codes for the alpha subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, is also involved in the t(8;21), and the gene coding for the beta subunit (CBFB) is involved in the inv(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are two of the most common recurring chromosomal rearrangements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF corresponds to the murine Pebp2 factor, and CBF binding sites are found in a number of eukaryotic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> enhancers and promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 at the AML1 binding site of the CSF1R (macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor gene) promoter by using reporter gene assays, and we analyzed the consequences of the expression of both chimeric proteins in an embryonic rat fibroblast cell line (Rat1A) in culture and after injection into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike AML1, which is an activator of the CSF1R promoter, the chimeric proteins did not transactivate the CSF1R promoter site but acted as inhibitors of AML1 (CBFA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 expressed in adherent Rat1A cells decreased contact inhibition of growth, and expression of AML1/MDS1 was associated with acquisition of the ability to grow in suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of AML1/MDS1 increased the tumorigenicity of Rat1A cells injected into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, whereas AML1/EAP expression prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that expression of AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 can interfere with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AML1 function, and that AML1/MDS1 has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting properties in an embryonic rat fibroblast cell line </plain></SENT>
