<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) effectively treats relapse after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT), but the response may require several months and may be associated with significant toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Filgrastim has also been observed to effectively treat leukemic relapse after alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed to determine the effectiveness of filgrastim in treating relapses after alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> were treated with filgrastim at relapse after alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Filgrastim was given at 5 mcg/kg/d subcutaneously for 21 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response was evaluated at 7 days after completion of filgrastim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, if present, were rapidly tapered to complete discontinuation at the time of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients were not assessable for response because additional therapy was necessary before completion of filgrastim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (43%) achieved a complete response on an intent-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When response was evaluated based on relapse type, three of four cytogenetic relapses, two of three morphologic relapses, and one of four hematologic relapses achieved a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two responses were observed in patients who were completely off of any immunosuppression at the time of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The event-free and overall survival rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients are 43% and 73%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of filgrastim with rapid discontinuation of immunosuppression results in response rates that are similar to results using DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Filgrastim could be considered as an alternative or an adjunct to DLI for relapses after alloSCT </plain></SENT>
