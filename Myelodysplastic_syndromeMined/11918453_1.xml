<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present phase II trial was to determine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response, and toxicity and to delineate the pharmacokinetics of oral low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> in a palliative treatment setting </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were given oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, 100 mg once daily for 14 d in a 21-d cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> concentrations were determined on d 1, 7, and 14 of every cycle before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> administration and, in addition, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h after drug intake on d 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 68 yr (range: 50-89 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to inclusion in the study was 21 mo (range: 0.5-144 mo) and most patients had advanced disease and were heavily pretreated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity during the first cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 67%, the white blood cell count nadir was &lt; 2.0 x 109/L and in 38% &lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelet count nadir was less than 25 x 10(9)/L in 24% of evaluable patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) of the free fraction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> was statistically significant at a log analysis (n = 12; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant correlation between the AUC and the 24-h concentration (n = 15; p &lt; 0.005) and between the concentrations at 24 h and d 7 (n = 11; p &lt; 0.005) of the free fractions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> had a moderate clinical effect in this group of heavily pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
