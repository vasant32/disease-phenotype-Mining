<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the expression of Fas (CD95), Fas-Ligand (Fas-L) and TNF-alpha factors known to be involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in the marrow of 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and characterized their functional relevance in in vitro assays of haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multidimensional flow cytometry revealed phenotypically aberrant blasts as defined by orthogonal light scatter and CD45 expression in the marrow of 24/44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those blasts Fas expression was increased on CD34-positive cells and on cells co-expressing HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Fas-L was expressed on some CD34+ cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients but was never detected on CD34+ cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fas and Fas-L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TNF-alpha, known to increase Fas expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, were up-regulated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha protein and sTNF-R1 levels in marrow plasma were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in controls (P&lt;0.002 and &lt;0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, results were dependent upon disease category: TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) than in patients with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) (P=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the proportion of Fas-L-positive cells was lowest in patients with RA (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In marrow cultures, Fas-Ig, rhuTNFR:Fc or anti-TNF-alpha antibody, by blocking Fas or TNF mediated signals, respectively, significantly increased the numbers of haemopoietic colonies compared to untreated cells (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.003, P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show significant dysregulation in the expression of TNF-alpha, Fas and Fas-L in the marrow from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of these molecules appears to be of functional relevance in the dysregulation of haemopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be amenable to therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
