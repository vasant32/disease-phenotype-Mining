<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic breakpoints of 7q deletions are variable, with both terminal and interstitial deletions reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is now believed that most deletions are interstitial, and that the variability in reported breakpoints may be due to the difficulty in determining whether the terminal, pale staining G band is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has also been suggested that some reported deletions of 7q may be cryptic translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address these questions, we carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on leukaemic cells from a large series of patients using a chromosome 7-specific paint and a 7q telomere-specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 cases studied, seven were 'pure' deletions (ie without the involvement of other chromosomes); four were interstitial and two terminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One further patient had two clones each with a different deletion: one with a terminal del(7)(q22) and the second with an interstitial del(7)(q32-qter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further nine cases had unbalanced translocations with deletion of 7q terminal sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 10 cases were translocations and complex rearrangements, some involving interstitial deletions of 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases in which del(7q) was reported as the sole cytogenetic abnormality by G-banding, FISH revealed cryptic translocations involving 7q </plain></SENT>
