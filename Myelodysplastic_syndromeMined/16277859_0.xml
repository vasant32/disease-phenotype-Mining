<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>62 cases receiving a scheme of combination of ATRA, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> (group A) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 33 cases (group B) were provided with vitamin supplementation, chalybeate drugs, and one or two of the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and biopsy were performed for collecting the specimens at the baseline and afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditions of the patients were monitored by means of weekly complete blood counts and the monthly examination, including toxicity test, physical examination, electrocardiography, and biochemistry panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that after treating for 8 weeks in group A, 4 out of 62 patients showed complete remission and 12 patients showed partial remission according to the defined response criteria, and 43 patients (69.35%) showed hematological improvement (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The further treatment for 16 out of 62 patients (25.81%), 13 failures (10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(5)) with a median survival interval of 26.25 months, were observed and interrupted for some reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, partial remission was observed only in 3 patients in group B, and HI amounted to 51.51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the disease progression was observed in 12 out of 33 patients (36.36%) with a median survival interval of 16 months, 9 failures (including 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall ratios of survival for 3 and 5 years in group A, which received the combination, reached to 69.24% and 53.72% respectively, in comparison with 52.23% and 31.34% in the patients of group B (log-rank, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The following requirements, if were met, would be significant for prognosis: the combination regiment, no transformation, children, no complication, female, 90-120 g/L of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular bone marrow and uni-cytopenias (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Cox regression showed that therapy, transformation and age are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the independent factors (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the combination of above mentioned 3 drugs may be effective and safe treatment for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its relevant mechanisms can be involved in the combination, that elicits a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as differentiation, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519689" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor-promotion</z:e>, anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> and immunoregulation </plain></SENT>
