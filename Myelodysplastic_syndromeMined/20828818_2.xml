<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation was detected in 17 of 34 MDS (50%) and 22 of 72 AML (31%) (p=0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation was detected in eleven of 17 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (65%), and eleven of 55 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (20%) (p=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> sequence revealed methylation at many CpG sites in the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased RIZ1 expression was accompanied by methylation in six of nine samples examined, while it was also observed in seven of 13 without methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells, that have RIZ1 methylation, with 5-Aza-dC, induced growth suppression with RIZ1 restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the RIZ1 gene is inactivated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in part by methylation, whereas another mechanism should be involved in others </plain></SENT>
