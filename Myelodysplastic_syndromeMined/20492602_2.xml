<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When human leucocyte antigens (HLA)-sensitized patients fail to respond to HLA-matched (HLA-m) platelets, non-immune destruction may be assumed, and collections of HLA-m platelets abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report cases of highly HLA-sensitized patients whose only satisfactory platelet transfusion responses were consistently associated with products compatible for both HLA- and ABO-matched (HLA-m/ABO-m) platelets, and in whom unsatisfactory increments occurred if either form of major incompatibility was permitted (HLA-u or ABO-u) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute platelet increments (APIs) were measured and classified as satisfactory if ≥10 and unsatisfactory if &lt;10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 1, age 59 years, group O, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), was unresponsive to either fresh ABO-m or HLA-m platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 17 HLA-m platelets, satisfactory responses occurred for 75% of HLA-m/ABO-m units, and failures for 100% of HLA-m/ABO-u, with mean API differing significantly (14·1 vs 1·1, P = 0·0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 36 HLA-m platelets given to patient 2, age 49 years, group O, Gravida 2 Para 2, with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, a satisfactory response occurred with 75% of HLA-m/ABO-m units, and failures for 63% of the HLA-m/ABO-u (mean API 26·7 vs 7·6, P = 0·008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increment failures from HLA-m platelets need not imply intractable refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If resources permit, selection of HLA-m/ABO-m platelets may optimise the incremental response </plain></SENT>
