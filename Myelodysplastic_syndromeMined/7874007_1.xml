<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hematological and clinical status of 145 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 14 of whom (10%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Eo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these 14 patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their bone marrow cells exhibited trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and some morphological abnormalities in the eosinophils, including disproportion of eosinophilic granules, basophilic granules, a ring-shaped nucleus, and vacuolation in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these abnormalities were less prominent than those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (FAB: M4Eo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the 14 MDS-Eo patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), seven had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 12 of 13 MDS-Eo patients (92%), in particular, there were major karyotypic abnormalities (MAKA) in eight patients (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic agents were not effective in the treatment of four patients after leukemic transformation occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These four patients died of the leukemic transformation while seven died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Eo patients are still alive; two of them have already transformed to a leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of survival of these patients was significantly shorter than that of the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be a poor prognostic factor that is strongly related to the existence of MAKA </plain></SENT>
