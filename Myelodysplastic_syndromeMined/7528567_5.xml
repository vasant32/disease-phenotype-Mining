<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic subpopulations of these CD34+ cells were analyzed for CD38, HLA-DR, CD33, CD13, CD14, CD41 and CD3 plus CD19, in association with proliferative and differentiative capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 15 studies performed included 12 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression rate of CD13 significantly increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cell population with a value of 91.4% +/- 11.6% and ranging from 60.3% to 100%, and exceeded 99% in four studies, whereas that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells was 49.9% +/- 15.8%, ranging from 28.2% to 70.1% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coexpression rate of CD38, HLA-DR, CD33, CD14, and CD3 plus CD19 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34+ cells did not significantly differ from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of colonies and clusters grown from 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow CD34+ cells was 40.4 +/- 8.6, the range being from 27.2 to 50.3; this varied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow CD34+ cells with a value of 34.0 +/- 28.7, the range being 0 to 95.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lineage of colonies and clusters promoted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow CD34+ cells was predominantly committed to nonerythroid with impaired differentiation in 13 of 15 studies (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD13 is first expressed during hematopoiesis by colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage and is absent in erythroid progenitors </plain></SENT>
