<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> of SRSF2, one of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing machinery genes, has been identified in a substantial proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical and biologic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with this mutation remain to be addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 34 (14.6%) of the 233 MDS patients were found to have SRSF2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 mutation was closely associated with male sex (P = .001) and older age (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It occurred concurrently with at least 1 additional mutation in 29 patients (85.3%) and was closely associated with RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations (P = .004, P &lt; .001, and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with SRSF2 mutation had an inferior overall survival (P = .010), especially in the lower risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further exploration showed that the prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutation might be attributed to its close association with old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential analyses in 173 samples from 66 patients showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SRSF2-mutated patients retained their original mutations, whereas none of the SRSF2-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SRSF2 mutation is associated with distinct clinical and biologic features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is stable during the clinical course and may play little role in disease progression </plain></SENT>
