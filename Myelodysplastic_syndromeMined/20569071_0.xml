<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression level of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR) in malignant clone cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunochemistry (alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase) were used together to detect the expression of IGF-IR in the bone marrow cells of 26 MDS patients with known abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The average IGF-IR expression level on the surface of clone cells from the 26 MDS cases was markedly elevated compared with the corresponding level in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (78.2 ± 13.7% vs. 14.1 ± 14.0%, p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentages of malignant clone cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 MDS cases were significantly correlated with the respective percentages of IGF-IR-positive nucleated cells (r = 0.909; p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the IGF-IR expression level on the clone cells were observed either between high- and low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients or among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with different abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IGF-IR might be taken as a marker of clone cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
