<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We, herein, report a significantly lower IRS2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRS2 expression was reduced in high-risk, compared to low-risk disease, and positively correlated with neutrophil and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IRS2 was upregulated during erythroid differentiation of CD34(+) cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and also during erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic differentiation in cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that defective IRS2 expression plays a role in the impaired hematopoietic cell differentiation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
