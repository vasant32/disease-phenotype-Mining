<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RUNX1 encodes a DNA binding subunit of the core-binding transcription factors and is frequently mutated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in RUNX1 are thought to confer upon hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) a pre-leukemic state, but the fundamental properties of Runx1 deficient pre-leukemic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Runx1 deficiency decreases both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation, but only minimally impacts the frequency of long term repopulating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> (LT-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been variously reported that Runx1 loss increases LT-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> numbers, decreases LT-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> numbers, or causes age-related <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempt to resolve these discrepancies by showing that Runx1 deficiency alters the expression of several key <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> markers, and that the number of functional LT-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> varies depending on the criteria used to score them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identify genes and pathways, including the cell cycle and p53 pathways that are dysregulated in Runx1 deficient <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
