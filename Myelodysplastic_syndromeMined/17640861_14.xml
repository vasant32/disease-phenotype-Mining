<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) has become one of the leading agents for the treatment of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are necessary to determine the relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with this drug, the minimum duration of therapy for induction of remission, and whether or not there is need for maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a total of 185 patients (with 73 primary idiopathic PRCA and 112 with secondary PRCA), we evaluated 62 patients with primary idiopathic PRCA for this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The remission induction therapy for these patients included CsA (n=31), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (CS) (n=20) or other drugs (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CsA and CS produced remissions in 23 (74%) and 12 (60%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The salvage treatment produced remissions in 58 patients (94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one and 15 patients were maintained on CsA+/-CS (CsA-containing group) or CS alone (CS group), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> in the CsA-containing group was 103 months, longer than that seen in the CS group (33 months) (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 14 patients whose CsA was discontinued, 12 patients (86%) relapsed after a median of 3 months (range 1.5 to 40 months), while only 3 of 27 patients (11%) relapsed during CsA-containing maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the discontinuance of maintenance therapy was strongly correlated with relapse (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients in the CsA-containing group died; however, the OS of this group was not significantly different from that of the CS-groups (p=0.104) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CsA-containing regimens sustain prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> more effectively than CS in primary idiopathic PRCA and seem to be important to prevent relapse </plain></SENT>
