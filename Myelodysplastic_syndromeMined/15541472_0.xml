<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed our series of myelodysplastic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype observed in a period of 11 years, with the aim of identifying clinical features of possible prognostic significance within this subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that among clinical scoring systems, the Bournemouth score appears the best prognostic indicator for risk of leukemic transformation, and platelet count &lt;100 x 10(9)/l(-1), presence of haemorrhagic symptoms at time of diagnosis and morphologic FAB classification are the main prognostic factors for prediction of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of genetic abnormalities as detected by conventional cytogenetics or even the more sensitive molecular techniques in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, clinical variables could be of help in identifying patients with different prognosis, suitable for risk adapted therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
