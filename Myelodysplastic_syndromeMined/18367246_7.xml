<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (TSG) are now recognized as an abnormal mechanism contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of FHIT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we examined the methylation status of FHIT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase (MSP) chain reaction was performed to detect the aberrant promoter methylation of FHIT gene in 55 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormal methylation of the FHIT gene was found in 26 of 55 (47.2%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, but it was not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between FHIT gene methylation and sex, hematologic parameters, chromosomal abnormalities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the significant difference was observed in the frequencies of FHIT gene hypermethylation among patients with RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (7/25, 28.0%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (11/18, 61.1%) and RAEBt (8/11, 72.7%) (chi2 value=7.938, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the frequency of FHIT gene hypermethylation and different IPSS groups (chi2 value=10.110, P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with FHIT gene methylation had significantly shorter survival time than those without FHIT methylation (20.0 months vs. 40.0 months, P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that aberrant methylation of the FHIT gene might be one of molecular events involved in the disease progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and be an adverse prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
