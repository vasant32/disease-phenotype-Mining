<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohorts of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> received lenalidomide once daily for 21 days, every 28 days at dose levels of 15 to 70 mg/m(2)/dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received a fixed dose of 5 mg/m(2)/dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens for PK and immune modulation were obtained in the first cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (46 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), median age 16 years (range, 1 to 21 years), were enrolled, and 42 were fully assessable for toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had a cerebrovascular ischemic event of uncertain relationship to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DLTs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> at 15 mg/m(2); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphatemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo> at 40 mg/m(2); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> at 55 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose level evaluated (70 mg/m(2)), zero of six patients had DLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A maximum-tolerated dose was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No objective responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PK studies (n = 29) showed that clearance is faster in children younger than 12 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunomodulatory studies (n = 26) showed a significant increase in serum interleukin (IL) -2, IL-15, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, natural killer (NK) cells, NK cytotoxicity, and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cytoxicity, and a significant decrease in CD4(+)/CD25(+) regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide is well-tolerated at doses up to 70 mg/m(2)/d for 21 days in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Drug clearance in children younger than 12 years is faster than in adolescents and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide significantly upregulates cellular immunity, including NK and LAK activity </plain></SENT>
