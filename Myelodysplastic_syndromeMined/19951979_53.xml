<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Background Following a clinical evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Exjade</z:chebi>) it was concluded that, in addition to baseline body iron burden, ongoing transfusional iron intake should be considered when selecting doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1-year EPIC study, the largest ever investigation conducted for an iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, is the first to evaluate whether fixed starting doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi>, based on transfusional iron intake, with dose titration guided by serum ferritin trends and safety markers, provides clinically acceptable chelation in patients (aged &gt;or=2 years) with transfusional <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> from various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The recommended initial dose was 20 mg/kg/day for patients receiving 2-4 packed red blood cell units/month and 10 or 30 mg/kg/day was recommended for patients receiving less or more frequent transfusions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose adjustments were based on 3-month serum ferritin trends and continuous assessment of safety markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end-point was change in serum ferritin after 52 weeks compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 1744 patients enrolled had the following conditions; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (n=1115), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n=341), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=116), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (n=80), rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> (n=43) and other transfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> (n=49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a significant reduction in serum ferritin from baseline (-264 ng/mL; P&lt;0.0001), reflecting dosage adjustments and ongoing iron intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common (&gt;5%) adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances (28%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Analysis of this large, prospectively collected data set confirms the response to chelation therapy across various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, supporting initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> doses based on transfusional iron intake, with subsequent dose titration guided by trends in serum ferritin and safety markers (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00171821) </plain></SENT>
