<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient aged 73 years, who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EPP">erythropoietic protoporphyria</z:e> with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo>, at the same time as she was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myelodysplastic clone in her bone marrow completely lacked one of the two copies of chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As chromosome 18 is the locus of the ferrochelatase gene, we postulate that this chromosomal deletion led to reduced synthesis of the enzyme in the bone marrow clone, so causing the <z:mp ids='MP_0005654'>porphyria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nature of the remaining ferrochelatase allele was examined by polymorphism analysis and we discuss the insights that this patient's genotype may reveal about the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005654'>porphyria</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
