<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to their FAB classification at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted of a 6 month trial of CRA (100 mg m(-2) day(-1) and AT (800 mg day(-1)) with rHuEPO (150 units kg(-1) body weight subcutaneously three times a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rHuEPO dose was escalated to daily doses at 2 months, and 300 U kg(-1) body weight given three times a week for another 2 months and continuing therapy after 6 months in responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response was measured by elimination of transfusions requirement (partial response, PR) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and complete blood counts (complete response, CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Observed responses for the 23 evaluable patients were 2 CR and 6 PR (34.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio analysis showed that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> alone were 14 times more likely to respond than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study, two patients (8%) transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in CRA + AT + rHuEPO-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival of 34 months with a median follow-up of 17 months (range 3-70 months) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The response rates with the addition of rHuEPO to CRA and AT was similar but occurs earlier at 2 months compared to 6-10 months with CRA and AT alone and did not alter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in the group treated with rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Response to either therapy appeared to be limited to patients in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
