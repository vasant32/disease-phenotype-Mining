<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If only a portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the loss is usually accomplished by interstitial deletion of various bands, most frequently q12-14 to q31-33 [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 5q is the result of a translocation between chromosome 5 and another chromosome, with the loss of the derivative chromosome that contains 5q </plain></SENT>
