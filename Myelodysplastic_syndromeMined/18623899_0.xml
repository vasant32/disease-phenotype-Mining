<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a trial comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> versus chemotherapy as initial treatment for 55 patients, the haematological response rate was higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-comparative trials provided haematological response rates of about 90%, but it is not known whether or not this translates into a survival advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three non-comparative trials including patients with relapsed or refractory disease after chemotherapy, 50% of patients showed a survival time of at least 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of any direct comparisons, we do not know if this represents an improvement over the results obtained with the best palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) The only potential cure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation but this is not always feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are associated with myeloproliferation and PDGFR gene rearrangements; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> is the first drug available for these patients </plain></SENT>
