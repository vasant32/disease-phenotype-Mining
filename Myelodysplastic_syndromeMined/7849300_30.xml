<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to decrease the relapse rate after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, we initiated studies using 131I-labeled anti-CD45 antibody (BC8) to deliver radiation specifically to hematopoietic tissues, followed by a standard transplant preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution studies were performed in 23 patients using 0.5 mg/kg trace 131I-labeled BC8 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BC8 antibody was cleared rapidly from plasma with an initial disappearance half-time of 1.5 +/- 0.2 hours, presumably reflecting rapid antigen-specific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean radiation absorbed doses (cGy/mCi131I administered) were as follows: marrow, 7.1 +/- 0.8; spleen, 10.8 +/- 1.4; liver, 2.7 +/- 0.2; lungs, 2.1 +/- 0.1; kidneys, 0.7 +/- 0.1; and total body, 0.4 +/- 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in relapse had a higher marrow dose (11.4 cGy/mCi) than those in remission (5.2 cGy/mCi; P = .001) because of higher uptake and longer retention of radionuclide in marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were treated with a dose of 131I estimated to deliver 3.5 Gy (level 1) to 7 Gy (level 3) to liver, with marrow doses of 4 to 30 Gy and spleen doses of 7 to 60 Gy, followed by 120 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and two of seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) are alive disease-free at 8 to 41 months (median, 17 months) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity has not been measurably greater than that of CY/TBI alone, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that with the use of 131I-BC8 substantially greater doses of radiation can be delivered to hematopoietic tissues as compared with liver, lung, or kidney, which may improve the efficacy of marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
