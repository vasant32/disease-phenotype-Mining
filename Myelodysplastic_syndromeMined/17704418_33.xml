<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Older node-positive patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have improvements in relapse-free and overall survival similar to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared toxicity of older and younger patients in three randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Toxicity data were available for 93% of 6,642 patients enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three trials included: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) 8541, a comparison of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and fluorouracil in three dose schedules; CALGB 9344: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> with or without paclitaxel; and CALGB 9741: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and paclitaxel every 2 versus every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute grade 3 to 5 toxicities were compared among age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven percent of patients (n = 458) were age 65 or older, 3% were 70 or older, 38% were 51 to 64, and 55% were 50 or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.4%) were attributed to treatment; seven (1.5%) of 486 in patients 65 or older, 10 (0.40%) of 2,480 in patients who were 51 to 64 years, and seven (0.19%) of 3,676 occurred in patients younger than 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, older patients were significantly more likely to have grade 4 hematologic toxicity, to have discontinued treatment for toxicity, or to have died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Healthy older patients who met the strict eligibility criteria for these trials had a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> than younger patients, but no increase in nonhematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens derive the same benefits from newer chemotherapy regimens as younger patients but should be cautioned about the increased risk of toxicity and treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
