<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2.5 yr survival following ATG was influenced by pretreatment disease severity (defined by percentage reticulocytes, granulocyte and platelet counts), age and--in patients under 45 yr of age--by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment disease severity was less in patients aged between 20 and 45 yr and in females </plain></SENT>
