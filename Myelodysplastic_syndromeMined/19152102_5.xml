<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One feature of the molecular pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is aberrant gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such aberrations may be related to patient survival, and may indicate to novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed at identifying aberrant gene expression that is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow-derived CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from six healthy persons and 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were analyzed on cDNA macroarrays comprising 1,185 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, our patients were followed-up for 54 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found differential expression of genes that were hitherto unrecognized in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential expression of 10 genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical cluster analysis facilitated the separation of CD34+ cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, it also distinguished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-patients with short and long survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scrutinizing our cDNA macroarray data for genes that are associated with short survival, we found, among others, increased expression of six different genes that encode the proteasome subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the most differentially down-regulated gene was IEX-1, which encodes an anti-apoptotic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We confirmed its decreased expression on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level in an independent validation set of patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presented data broadens our notion about the molecular pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may lend itself to better identify patients with short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings may help to define new molecular targets for drug development and therapeutic approaches for patients with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
