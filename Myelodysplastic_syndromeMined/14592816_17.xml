<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a series of novel point mutations in ATRX detected in archival DNA samples from marrow and/or blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e> by use of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), a technique sensitive to low-level mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the new mutations result in changes in amino acids altered in previously described pedigrees with germ line ATRX mutations (ATR-X syndrome), but the hematologic abnormalities were much more severe in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e> than in the corresponding constitutional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e> case where DNA samples from several time points were available, the proportion of ATRX-mutant subclones correlated with changes in the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011903'>hemoglobin H</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study strengthens the link between acquired, somatic ATRX mutations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e>, illustrates how molecular defects associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> masked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> may be detected by DHPLC, and shows that additional factors increase the severity of the hematologic phenotype of ATRX mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
