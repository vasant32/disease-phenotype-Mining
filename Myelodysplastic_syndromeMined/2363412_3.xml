<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight consecutive patients with a FAB-classified primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were investigated for in vitro growth of colony-forming units for granulocyte-macrophage precursors (CFU-GM) and cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CFU-GM growth was found in 30 patients (79%), and clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in 13 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eight patients who showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM growth were either cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 5), or had a 5q-deletion (n = 3) as single or dominating karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 30 patients with reduced or no colony growth, ten patients had a clonal chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> developed in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of them grew any CFU-GM colonies, and three of them were cytogenetically abnormal at the time of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the bone marrow in vitro growth for CFU-GM and the karyotype in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> emphasizes the close relationship between these disorders and manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may be defined by a cytogenetic classification (e.g., the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>), and the CFU-GM growth pattern can be of value for predicting leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
