<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report two myelodysplatic syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with t(3; 5) (q25; q34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromosome specimens were prepared by short-term culture of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was performed by R banding technique, chromosome painting (fluorescence in situ hybridization, FISH) by using whole chromosome 3 and 5 probes in case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical and hematological findings were compatible with diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis showed that both patients had identical t(3; 5) (q25; q34) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 3q and 5q was proved by FISH in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: t(3; 5) translocation is a rare chromosome abnormality specifically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and frequently displays trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome painting technique is a reliable tool for detecting this translocation </plain></SENT>
