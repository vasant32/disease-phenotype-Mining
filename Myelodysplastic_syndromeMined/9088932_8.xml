<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although activation of the Evi-1 gene has been associated with chromosomal rearrangements of the 3q25-q28 region, ectopic expression of Evi-1 could also be observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> without cytogenetic abnormalities of the 3q26 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, human erythroleukemic cell lines were screened for the expression of Evi-1 mRNA by northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the erythroid cell lines, whether undifferentiated (K 562, HEL, LAMA 84) or exhibiting spontaneous terminal erythroid differentiation (KU 812, JK-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 mRNA levels were constant or elevated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-synthesizing KU 812 or K 562 cells in response to erythropoietin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 11/30 expressed Evi-1 by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these cases, 4/6 erythroleukemias without abnormalities of the 3q25-q28 region were found positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of acidophilic erythroblasts (15-47% of bone marrow cells) accounted for the existence of a terminal erythroid differentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Evi-1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML M6</z:e>, whereas one negative case was poorly differentiated and referred to as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML M6</z:e> variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Evi-1 mRNA expression can coexist with erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
