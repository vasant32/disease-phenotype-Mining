<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose-limiting factor is myelotoxicity with mild extramedullary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This Phase I study consisted of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335737" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received a total of 15 treatment courses of DWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The starting dose was 800 mg/m2 over 24 hours by continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose was first increased to 1200 mg/m2 and then to 1600 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical toxicity and urinary excretion studies of DWA suggested that 1200 mg/m2/d for successive days would be the best type of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When 1200 mg/m2/d was given for 5 days, Grade 2 to 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> were encountered requiring parenteral fluids and nutritional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the dose-limiting factor with this schedule was gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Myelotoxicity was severe, as expected, but tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) entered into complete remission and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in crisis returned to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A Phase II trial of DWA is warranted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, especially in myeloid diseases </plain></SENT>
