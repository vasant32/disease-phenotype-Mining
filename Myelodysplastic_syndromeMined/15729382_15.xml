<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 189 consecutive, adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> hospitalized in the hemato-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> ward of the University hospital Berne between 1995 and 1999 were included in a retrospective study to assess risk factors for IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 45 IA cases (nine proven, three probable, 33 possible), 11 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and 133 controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IA cases had more often <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (88 vs 38%, P &lt; 0.001) and a longer duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (mean 20.6 vs 9.9 days, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also had fewer neutropenic episodes during the preceding 6 months (mean 0.42 vs 1.03, P &lt; 0.001), that is, confirmed (82%) and probable (73%) IA occurred most often during the induction cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short time interval ( &lt; or = 14 days) between neutropenic episodes increased the risk of IA four-fold (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bacteremia</z:e>, however, was not related to the number of preceding neutropenic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neutropenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have the highest risk of IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk is highest during the first induction cycle of treatment and increases with short-time intervals between treatment cycles </plain></SENT>
