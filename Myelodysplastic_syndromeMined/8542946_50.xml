<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, no cure could be offered to patients relapsing following allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our long-term observations of the first patient with remission reinduced by allogeneic cell therapy (allo-CT) using donor peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we review the cumulative international experience with allo-CT used to treat 163 patients, 105 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 58 with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e>, who relapsed following allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient treated by allo-CT was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> resistant pre-B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in extensive third hematologic and extramedullary relapse shortly after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was given infusions of donor (sister) PBL in multiple increments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, he developed mild, reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) in parallel with regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematologic and cytogenetic disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 8 years after allo-CT, he is disease-free with Karnofsky score 100% and no evidence of residual male cells by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>International data show that relapse after BMT was successfully reversed by donor PBL treatment in 97 of 158 evaluable patients; 72/100 (72%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 25/58 (44.8%) with other malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (TCD) for prevention of GVHD was performed for 60/105 (57%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 31/58 (53.4%) patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete response after allo-CT was obtained in recipients of both TCD-BMT and unmodified BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GVHD due to allo-CT developed in 86/158 (54.4%) of the patients, 63/100 (63.0%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 23/58 (39.6%) with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) was given to 67.9% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 28.1% of patients with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cumulative experience shows that allo-CT can successfully reverse chemoradiotherapy-resistant relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and even more effectively of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> independently of alpha-interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although GVHD was frequent among responders, accompanied occasionally by transient or irreversible marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, remissions were also obtained in patients with no GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Allo-CT should therefore be considered as treatment of choice for overt relapse or de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Administration of donor peripheral blood lymphocytes in graded increments at an early stage of relapse may be the best approach for combining optimal timing at the stage of minimal disease while controlling and minimizing the risk of GVHD on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
