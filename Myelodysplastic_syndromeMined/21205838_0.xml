<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following metabolic activation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> are incorporated into DNA and invoke mismatch repair (MMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognition of 6-thioguanine (6-thioG) in DNA by key MMR proteins results in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rather than repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are suggestions that homologous recombination (HR) is involved downstream of MMR following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment, but the precise role of HR is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that cells deficient in RAD51D (a RAD51 paralogue) are extremely sensitive to 6-thioG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This sensitivity is almost completely rescued by the deletion of Mlh1, which suggests that HR is involved in the repair of the 6-thioG-induced recombinogenic lesions generated by MMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 6-thioG induces chromosome aberrations in the Rad51d-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Rad51d-deficient cells show a striking increase in the frequency of triradial and quadriradial chromosomes in response to 6-thioG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of these chromatid exchange-type aberrations indicates that the deficiency in RAD51D-dependent HR results in profound chromosomal damage precipitated by the processing of 6-thioG by MMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The radials are notable as an important source of chromosomal translocations, which are the most common class of mutations found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study thus suggests that HR insufficiency could be a potential risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancers</z:e> that result from long-term use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> in patients </plain></SENT>
