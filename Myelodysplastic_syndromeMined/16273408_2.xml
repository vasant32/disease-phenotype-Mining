<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, DAC) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analog, which, at low doses, acts as a hypomethylating agent and is fivefold to tenfold more active than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, Vidaza)--currently the only approved drug for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> has activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of a phase III multicenter North American trial comparing low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> to supportive care verified that therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> resulted in higher response rates, improved quality of life, and prolonged time to leukemic transformation and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, further elucidation of its mechanism of action is required, as clinical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> does not correlate with demethylation of the p15 gene promoter or the repetitive DNA element LINE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> appears to upregulate both hypermethylated and nonmethylated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ongoing studies aim to determine the optimal dose, schedule, and route of administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, and to evaluate whether efficacy can be improved by using it in combination with other agents, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
