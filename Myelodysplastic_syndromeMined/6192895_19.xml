<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal DNA content was found in two cases with aneuploid karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA content typical of a diploid population was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and in three patients with chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fraction of bone marrow cells in S- and G2-phase was higher in primary acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (without excess of blasts) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regardless to the diagnosis, the patients with low fraction of cells in S- and G2-phase had short survival time and showed high rate of evolution into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The labeling (LI) and mitotic (MI) indexes of both erythroblasts and granulocytic cells were decreased in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest values of LI and MI of the granulocytic compartment were found in the patients who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that cytokinetic analysis allows investigators to achieve useful information on the stage of disease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
