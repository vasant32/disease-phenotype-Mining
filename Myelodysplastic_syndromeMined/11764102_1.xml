<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here the beneficial effect of short-course HDMP therapy in a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> succinate (Prednol-L) was administered at a single daily dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days to a 4-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> before the initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to dramatic clinical improvement, the patient's white blood cell count increased from 2.3 x 10(9)/L to 5.0 x 10(9)/L, and peripheral blood blast cells disappeared 4 days after HDMP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated bone marrow aspirate 1 week after the initiation of HDMP disclosed increased cellularity with no blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, short-course HDMP treatment stimulated the increase in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD34+, and NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results obtained with HDMP from the previous studies and the present case suggest that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> is a promising agent in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and it is recommended as an initial treatment especially for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> at presentation </plain></SENT>
