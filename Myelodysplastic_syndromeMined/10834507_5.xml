<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduced expression of this antigen in patients with Wiscott-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aldrich syndrome</z:e>, in which progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> is a major problem, raised the question whether abnormal expression of this molecule could affect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of this antigen on the monocytes of ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) and compared the results with 67 patients suffering from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> syndromes and with 18 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We chose this series as it plays an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients where in most cases the neutrophils are defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the following antigens as indicative of activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the monocytes in these patients: CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD38, CD44, CD69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found decreased expression of CD43 on the monocytes of the RA, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t patients compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other activation molecules studied were found to be upregulated, suggesting the existence of activated monocytes in these patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further experiments are needed to investigate the significance of CD43 downregulation in these patients, its role in cell adherence and tissue migration, and the correlation of the phenomenon to the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
