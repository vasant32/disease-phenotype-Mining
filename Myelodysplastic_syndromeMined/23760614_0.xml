<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the potential use of peripheral blood and serum to identify and monitor bone marrow derived genetic markers using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array karyotyping (SNP-A) and parallel sequencing of 22 genes frequently mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pilot study, showed a 100% SNP-A karyotype concordance and 97% mutation concordance between the bone marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast mutation analysis by Sanger sequencing of peripheral blood and serum derived DNA showed only 65% and 42% concordance, respectively to bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show the potential utility of peripheral blood as a surrogate for bone marrow for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients avoiding the need for repeated bone marrow aspirates particularly in elderly patients and those with fibrotic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrows</z:e> </plain></SENT>
