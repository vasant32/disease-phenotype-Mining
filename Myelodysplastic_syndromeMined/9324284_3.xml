<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen varied according to diagnosis; 26 patients were conditioned with melphalan and total body irradiation, 66 received melphalan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and the remainder (50) were conditioned with melphalan alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up is 62 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> have occurred, both in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient developed Ph+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> 18 months post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, because of the timing of the haematological disorder, we considered the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> to be concurrent with or to have preceded the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> 20 months post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had been treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> for 10 years and was transplanted in third complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis in this case showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe this to have been an unequivocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our finding of a 1.1% incidence of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> (95% CI 0.02-4.96) from a census population adds weight to the hypothesis that haematological problems post-transplant reflects prior chemotherapy rather than toxicity from the transplant procedure itself </plain></SENT>
