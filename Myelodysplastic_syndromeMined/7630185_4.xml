<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Firstly, during the progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary macroglobulinemia</z:e> bone destruction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, a t(1;3)(p36;q21) was found as the sole clonal chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This translocation is characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with a high propensity for progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(1;3) has previously never been reported in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the abnormality is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation of cells of the myelopoietic lineages, it is possible that the t(1;3), found in cells of lymphoid origin in the present case, not only induced the neoplastic process as such but also brought about the unusually <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
