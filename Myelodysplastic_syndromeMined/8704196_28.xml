<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on 71 consecutive patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> referred to physicians belonging to the Société française de greffe de moelle from 1982 through 1991 and transplanted with marrow from HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 16 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 27 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells, and 28 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had received cytoreductive chemotherapy before the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease progressed in 17 patients between diagnosis and grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients are alive with a median follow-up of 6 years, whereas 24 died from relapse and 24 from transplant-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival, relapse and transplant-related mortality at 7 years were 32%, 48%, and 39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test and Cox's model revealed better outcome among young patients, patients in an early stage of the French-American-British (FAB) classification or with a low percentage of marrow blasts before transplantation, patients who did not undergo cytoreductive chemotherapy before transplantation, and patients conditioned with total body irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high rate of relapse in advanced FAB stages has led us to graft patients earlier in the course of the disease, and we are currently conducting a multicenter, randomized study to determine the value of intensive chemotherapy before grafting in patients with an excess of marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
