<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study we have addressed the question whether this situation reflects an increased programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the in situ end-labelling technique was applied to formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded trephine biopsies derived from patients and a control group without any haematological disorder </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in the haemopoietic marrow of patients with either disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using double-immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody PG-MI (CD68), we were able to demonstrate that approximately one third of the apoptotic cells were ingested by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings are in keeping with previously published data that postulated increased frequencies of macrophages in these disorders as well as raised serum levels of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
