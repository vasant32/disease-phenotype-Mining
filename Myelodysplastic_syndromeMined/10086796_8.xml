<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated 13 patients with morphologically advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and total body irradiation, followed by allogeneic marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added to the preparative regimen to selectively increase chemosensitivity of leukaemic cells and to improve transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No regimen-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, and no side-effects related to the addition of G-CSF were observed except for transient mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up time of 39 months the projected 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival were 67.7% and 75.5%, respectively, with only one case showing cytogenetic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen including G-CSF is feasible, and preliminary results seem to be encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a larger trial is clearly warranted to evaluate its efficacy </plain></SENT>
