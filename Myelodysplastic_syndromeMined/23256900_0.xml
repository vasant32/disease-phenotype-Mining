<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many countries have various requirements for local economic analyses to assess the value of a new health technology and/or to secure reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents a case study of an economic model developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs standard azole therapy (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>) to prevent invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (IFIs), which was adapted by at least 11 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Modeling techniques were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> as IFI prophylaxis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the core model, the probabilities of experiencing an IFI, IFI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes were estimated from clinical trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Locally changed parameters were probabilities of long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and survival, currency, drug costs, health utility, IFI treatment costs, and discount rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Locally adapted cost-effective modeling studies indicate that prophylaxis with posaconazole, compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>, prolongs survival, and, in most countries, is cost-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries, the model predicted that prophylaxis with posaconazole would be associated with an increase in life-years, with increases ranging from 0.016-0.1 life-year saved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries, use of the model led to posaconazole being approved by the appropriate reimbursement authority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study did not have power to detect differences between posaconazole and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 100 days was assumed to be equal for those who did and did not develop an IFI, and equal probabilities of IFI-related and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the trial period were used for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A core economic model was successfully adapted locally by several countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The model showed that posaconazole was cost-saving or cost-effective vs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> and led to positive reimbursement <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
