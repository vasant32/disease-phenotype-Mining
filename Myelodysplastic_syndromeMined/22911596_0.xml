<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was primarily undertaken to test the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) mutations may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed mtDNA sequences from 15 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples were obtained from bone marrow, and patients' oral epithelial cells were collected for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total DNA was amplified by PCR after extraction, and these segments were then sent for sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of oral epithelial tissues as well as mtDNA sequences in the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected 61 heteroplasmic mutations in 11 genes, including those encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (ND)1-2 and 4-6, tRNA glutamic acid (TRNE), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> (RNR) 1 and 2, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase (COX1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi> (CYTB), and tRNA glycine (TRNG); mutation rates were particularly high in ND2 (34.4%) and ND4 (21.3%) in the patients' mtDNA genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The products of these genes are involved in oxidation in the respiratory chain, and a large number of homoplasmic mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these 162 polymorphisms were mostly in the D-loop DNA structure (54.3%), in which numerous mutations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that functional impairment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain induced by mutation may be an important reason for hematopoietic failure in AA patients </plain></SENT>
