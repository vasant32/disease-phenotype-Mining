<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied mutations in TET2, ASXL1 and EZH2 in 153 Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TET2 mutations were detected in 35 patients (23%), ASXL1 in 33 patients (22%) and EZH2 in 8 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASXL1 mutations were associated with increased colony formation of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM (P-values, 0.049, 0.011 and 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EZH2 mutations were common in patients with poor IPSS cytogenetics (P=0.001) and in patients in the IPSS intermediate-2/high-risk cohorts (P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In uni- but not multi-variate analyses, mutated TET2 was associated with longer survival (P=0.044) whereas EZH2 mutations were associated with an increased risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest ASXL1 mutations might results in dominance of the mutant clone in Chinese with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> whereas EZH2 mutations might predict an increased risk of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
