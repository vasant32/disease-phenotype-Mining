<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic features were examined in a group of 68 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) referred to a single institution between 1971-1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphologic French-American-British (FAB) system of classification proved of limited value in this group of patients because 50% of the cases were categorized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 63 cases and clonal abnormalities were detected in 55%; the most common chromosome involved was number 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modification of the FAB system to incorporate additional diagnostic features such as pretreatment fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb F) and cytogenetics allowed incorporation of the categories of juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>) and infantile <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 syndrome (IMo7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting groups of patients had highly significant differences in survival (P = .00009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival for the patients was 31.9% (95% CI 21.7 to 44.1) and factors influencing prognosis included: modified FAB type, platelet count, Hb F level, and cytogenetic complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed a scoring system ("FPC") where each of the following findings at diagnosis scored one point: HbF greater than 10%, platelets &lt; or = 40 x 10(9)/L, and complex karyotypic changes (two or more clonal structural/numerical abnormalities), which produced groups with highly significant differences, patients with a score of 0 having a 5-year survival of 61.6% (CI 33% to 84%), whereas those with a score of two or three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died within 4 years of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The revised classification and scoring system may prove helpful in making treatment choices in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and now needs to be tested prospectively in large scale population-based studies </plain></SENT>
