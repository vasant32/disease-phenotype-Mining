<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several clinical trials have attempted to reverse cytopenia by using hematopoietic growth factors (HGF), success has been limited due in part to a limited understanding of the role of HGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FLT3 ligand, which binds to and activates the FLT3 receptor, does not have a stimulatory effect on hematopoietic cells, but can synergize with other HGF to support the expansion of both immature and committed progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA technology we measured endogenous serum levels in 93 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 29 RA, 1 RARS, 31 RAEB, 23 RAEBt, 9 CMML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>48.3% of RA patients' sera had significantly elevated FLT3 ligand levels ranging from 404 to 5735 pg/ml, whereas none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, RAEBt, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients sera had levels different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between FLT3 ligand levels and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, age, cytogenetic abnormalities, or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that FLT3 ligand levels can be upregulated early in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may represent an appropriate response to a decreased number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors, or alternatively a dysregulated HGF system </plain></SENT>
