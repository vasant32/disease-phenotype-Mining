<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined its effect on differentiation, proliferation, and gene expression in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays in semisolid medium combined with morphologic examination and flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed that NUP98-HOXA9 increased the numbers of erythroid precursors and impaired both myeloid and erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In continuous liquid culture, cells transduced with NUP98-HOXA9 exhibited a biphasic growth curve with initial growth inhibition followed by enhanced long-term proliferation, suggesting an increase in the numbers of primitive self-renewing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by a dramatic increase in the numbers of long-term culture-initiating cells, the most primitive hematopoietic cells detectable in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was done at several time points over 16 days, starting at 6 hours posttransduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early growth suppression was preceded by up-regulation of IFNbeta1 and accompanied by marked up-regulation of IFN-induced genes, peaking at 3 days posttransduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, oncogenes such as homeobox transcription factors, FLT3, KIT, and WT1 peaked at 8 days or beyond, coinciding with increased proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, several putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors and genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were repressed at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the changes in proliferation, differentiation, and global gene expression that underlie the leukemic transformation of human hematopoietic cells by NUP98-HOXA9 </plain></SENT>
