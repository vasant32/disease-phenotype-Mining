<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1983-1988 bone marrow samples obtained from 195 peroxidase-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients were analyzed for their surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these patients (6.7%) had myelomonocytic-positive and lymphoid-negative antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These leukemic cells reacted with CD13 in eight patients, CD33 in seven, CD11 in six and CDw41 in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In none of these patients did the leukemic cells react with CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD19 or CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells from two patients were reactive with CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These leukemic cells demonstrated L2 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in 11 patients and L1 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells from the final patient were diagnosed as those of leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormality was observed in approximately half of the patients examined (6/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical analysis revealed that the leukemic cells were negative for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff stain but positive for acid phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of these patients was markedly poor as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or typical peroxidase-positive nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was induced in only 30% of patients and duration of survival was short (4.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that myelomonocytic antigen-positive peroxidase-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> is a distinct type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and may require more aggressive therapy to improve survival </plain></SENT>
