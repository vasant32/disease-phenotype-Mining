<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the water-soluble bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> treosulfan demonstrated broad stem cell toxicity, immunosuppressive as well as antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to its well known low non-hematologic toxicity profile, treosulfan was considered an alternative agent for conditioning prior to allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A first clinical study, combining 3 x 10 g/m2 of treosulfan with 5 x 30 mg/m2 of fludarabine, demonstrated the feasibility of this conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fast, reliable and complete development of the donor hematopoiesis was evident as well as a low non-hematologic toxicity, transplantation-related mortality and relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second study treosulfan was escalated from 3 x 10 to 3 x 12 and 3 x 14 g/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this protocol, 55 pts (patients) not amenable to standard conditioning suffering from various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete donor chimerism was reached by day 28 in 80% of the pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So far, 8 pts (11%) died without disease progression and 11 pts (20%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treosulfan was very well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Especially no hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VOD</z:e>, severe cardiac or pulmonary toxicity was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GvHD (degrees 11-IV) occurred in 44% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD in 45% of pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering the poor prognosis of these study populations, treosulfan-based conditioning is considered to be safe and efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New phase 11 clinical protocols in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will be initiated </plain></SENT>
