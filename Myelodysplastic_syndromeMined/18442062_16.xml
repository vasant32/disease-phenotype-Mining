<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study of 126 adult patients with French-American-British-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), staging by the International Prognostic Scoring System was highly predictive of survival outcome (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement at diagnosis (P = 0.001), but not the number of RBC units transfused during the disease course (P = 0.17), was independently associated with inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no correlations between survival and serum ferritin level, measured either at diagnosis (median 567 ng/mL, range 16-3,475; P = 0.24) or during follow-up (median 1,108 ng/mL; range 238-43,500; P = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no difference in survival when patients were stratified by serum ferritin levels of &lt; or &gt; or =1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis or peak serum ferritin levels of &lt;1,000, 1,000-5,000, or &gt;5,000 ng/mL during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study does not support the contention that transfusional <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> is an adverse prognostic factor in "good risk" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
