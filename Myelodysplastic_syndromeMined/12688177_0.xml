<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), published in 1997 by Greenberg et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[9] is based on the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities and number of cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied criteria of the IPSS on 205 patients (pts) with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA = 82, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> = 49, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> = 42, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t = 8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> = 24 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IPSS discriminated within each of the FAB-subgroups: RA pts were present in low risk and intermediate (Int) I and II risk subgroups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> pts were separated into low and Int I, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> were distributed predominantly between Int I and Int II risk groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t in high-risk group, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> pts were distributed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrary to Greenberg's group of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients there are only three risk-groups in our study: low risk (score 0-0.5), intermediate (1-2) and high risk (&gt; 2); the median survival and the risk of the evolution to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.0001) are significantly different </plain></SENT>
