<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ringed sideroblasts ranging from 1 to 86% of cells were found in 76 (57%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> corresponding to the group entitled "acquired idiopathic sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>" had between 21 and 86% ringed sideroblasts; these were also found in 40% (26/65) cases corresponding to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 22 cases having morphological features of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation had ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It would appear that cases of acquired idiopathic sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> have at least 20% ringed sideroblasts; they also seem to occur frequently in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
