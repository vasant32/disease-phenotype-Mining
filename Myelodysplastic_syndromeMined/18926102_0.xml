<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry quantifies the gene product expression on hematopoietic cells, permitting the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells within a bone marrow aspirate and classifying them according to lineage and maturational stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationships in the expression of multiple markers on myeloblasts, maturing monocytes, and myeloid cells suggests that development of these cells is a stepwise process in which genes are not only turned on or off, but are up- and down-regulated at the junctions between stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e>, a loss of coordination of these steps is seen, resulting in the abnormal relationships identified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, the abnormal patterns can be identified on both the immature myeloblasts and maturing myeloid cells and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection of these abnormalities is useful in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> but requires a detailed understanding of the expression of these gene products to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> from a stressed marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the patterns of antigen expression for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis are precisely defined, each patient with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> has a unique repertoire of abnormalities that may evolve as the disease progresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, scoring systems, in which the abnormalities are counted, provide a means for determining the extent of dysregulation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the maturational steps, thereby determining a "distance from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" for a patient at a specific time in the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is useful, not only to facilitate diagnosis, but to provide prognostic information that may be complementary to the conventional classification schemes and scoring systems </plain></SENT>
