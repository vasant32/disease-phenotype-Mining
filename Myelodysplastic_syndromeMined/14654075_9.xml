<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>KIT and FMS, members of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family, are expressed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells and have important roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FLT3 is also a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family and plays important role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, NK, and dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, internal tandem duplication (ITDs) mutations have been found in the juxtamembrane (JM) region of FLT3 receptor expressed by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutations result in the constitutive dimerization and activation of the receptor, contributing to leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KIT and FMS are also frequently expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and are closely related to FLT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, similar ITD mutations could also occur in the KIT and/or FMS gene of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To explore this possibility, 13 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and 44 AML patient samples were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of ITD mutations in the JM region of the KIT or FMS receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 13 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines or 44 AML primary bone marrow samples express ITDs in either KIT or FMS in the JM region that is involved in FLT3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 13 cell lines and 44 AML samples were also examined for the possible co-expression of KIT and/or FMS receptors with their respective ligands, as we have seen for FLT3 and its ligand, FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This co-expression could contribute to leukemic transformation through autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine activation mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And 6/13 cell lines and 27/44 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples exhibit co-expression of the KIT receptor and ligand (SCF) while 10/13 cell lines and 35/44 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples exhibit co-expression of the FMS receptor and ligand (CSF-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, while ITD mutations were not found, the findings of co-expression of KIT and/or FMS with their respective ligands implies these receptors might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> through autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine interactive stimulation </plain></SENT>
