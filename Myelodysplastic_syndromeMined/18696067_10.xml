<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several randomized trials have shown favorable results concerning response rate, survival, transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these trials, treatment was administered continuously until progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the retrospective study presented here, we evaluated the outcome of patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) treated with a limited number of 5-AZA cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 patients received 5-AZA alone (n=30) or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-AZA was administered subcutaneously at a fixed dose of 75 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days and repeated every 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5-AZA was given for a median of four courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued for two more cycles as consolidation in patients who had achieved complete remission (CR), marrow CR, or stable disease with hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 50% according to the modified International Working Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete remissions were achieved in 15.6% and stable disease in 34.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood counts normalized in 6.3% of patients while hematologic improvement was achieved in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in responding patients was 45 weeks, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> occurred after a median of 14 weeks in non-responding patients (P= .038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 60 weeks; the median survival of responders was 74 weeks compared with 26 weeks in non-responders (P= .047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis, 5-AZA was associated with a survival advantage in responding patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These favorable results suggest that patients may benefit even from a limited number of courses of 5-AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A randomized controlled clinical trial is required to prospectively validate these findings </plain></SENT>
