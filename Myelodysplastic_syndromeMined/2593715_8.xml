<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease was preceded by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> of a different subtype in 24% of the patients and transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>Splenomegaly</z:hpo> was present in 54% of the patients and reached massive proportions in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities occurred in 34% of those studied, most commonly in the younger age group; the most frequent were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and deletions involving the long arms of chromosomes 20 and X </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When these factors were subjected to a multivariate analysis, only bone marrow blast cell percentage was an independent prognostic determinant </plain></SENT>
