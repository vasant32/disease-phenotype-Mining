<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE Updated results are presented after a median follow-up of 7.3 years from the phase III First-Line Indolent Trial of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ((90)Y) -ibritumomab tiuxetan in advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with CD20(+) stage III or IV FL with complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), or partial response (PR) after first-line induction treatment were randomly assigned to (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation therapy (rituximab 250 mg/m(2) days -7 and 0, then (90)Y-ibritumomab 14.8 MBq/kg day 0; maximum 1,184 MBq) or no further treatment (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) from date of random assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results For 409 patients available for analysis ((90)Y-ibritumomab, n = 207; control, n = 202), estimated 8-year overall PFS was 41% with (90)Y-ibritumomab versus 22% for control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients in CR/CRu after induction, 8-year PFS with (90)Y-ibritumomab was 48% versus 32% for control (HR, 0.61; P = .008), and for PR patients, it was 33% versus 10% (HR, 0.38; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation, median PFS was 4.1 years (v 1.1 years for control; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to next treatment (TTNT) was 8.1 years for (90)Y-ibritumomab versus 3.0 years for control (P &lt; .001) with approximately 80% response rates to second-line therapy in either arm, including autologous stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No unexpected toxicities emerged during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Estimated between-group 8-year overall survival rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Annualized incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was 0.50% versus 0.07% in (90)Y-ibritumomab and control groups, respectively (P = .042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation after achieving PR or CR/CRu to induction confers 3-year benefit in median PFS with durable 19% PFS advantage at 8 years and improves TTNT by 5.1 years for patients with advanced FL </plain></SENT>
