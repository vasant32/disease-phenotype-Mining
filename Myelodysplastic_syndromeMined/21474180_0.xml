<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a double layer culture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, there was no difference in the colony growth promoting capacity of autologous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> stimulated or unstimulated blood lymphocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, similar to control studies, increasing numbers of lymphocytes, (0, 1×10(5), 1×10(6)) led to a corresponding increase in the number of CFU-GM (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blood mononuclear cells have the ability to stimulate colony growth of autologous CD34+ cells while these selected progenitors show a proliferative capacity that is similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when they are isolated from the bone marrow accessory cells </plain></SENT>
