<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe molecular findings in a patient with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and t(11;17)(q23;q25) who responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated rearrangement of MLL, while RT-PCR analysis and sequencing identified the transcript fusion partner as SEPT9, a member of the septin family of GTPases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MLL-SEPT9 fusion appears to be rare, having been described to date in only seven cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and not, to our knowledge, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of MLL-septin family member fusion products such as the one seen here may provide further insights into the etiology of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and MLL-SEPT9 fusion may be worth seeking in other cases of MLL rearrangements with a translocation partner on chromosome 17q </plain></SENT>
