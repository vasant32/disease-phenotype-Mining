<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, complex chromosome aberrations can be seen, among which aberrations of chromosome 5 constitute a substantial part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With conventional cytogenetic technique, these aberrations are often identified as deletions or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed nine patients who, under conventional cytogenetic analysis, showed deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole-chromosome painting probes to identify the counterpart chromosome and locus-specific identifiers for 5q31 and 5q33 approximately q34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A deletion of 5q was found concomitant with unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results and cases from the literature showed that material from chromosome 5 could be translocated to almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but one had short survival; this one patient had a preserved 5q31 and 5q33 approximately q34 but a deletion of the q-arm more centromeric than these bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight of the nine patients, further 14 translocations were revealed, not involving chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
