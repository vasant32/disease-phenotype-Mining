<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports suggest that lenalidomide is anti-angiogenic and this property appears to be related to efficacy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effect of lenalidomide on the formation of microvessels in a novel in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> assay utilizing human umbilical arterial rings and in a capillary-like cord formation assay using cultured primary endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that lenalidomide consistently inhibits both sprout formation by arterial rings and cord formation by endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found an inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on the associations between cadherin 5, beta-catenin and CD31, adherens junction proteins whose interaction is critical for endothelial cell cord formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lenalidomide inhibited VEGF-induced PI3K-Akt pathway signaling, which is known to regulate adherens junction formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found a strong inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced endothelial cell formation of cords and HIF-1 alpha expression, the main mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-mediated effects and a key driver of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-metastatic activity of lenalidomide in vivo was confirmed in the B16-F10 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> model by a &gt;40% reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> lung colony counts versus untreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that inhibitory effects on microvessel formation, in particular adherens junction formation and inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced processes support a potential anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic mechanism for this clinically active drug </plain></SENT>
