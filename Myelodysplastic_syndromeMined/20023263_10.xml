<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in FA are not well established, nor is the significance of clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed bone marrow samples of 119 FA patients: 23 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with the most common subtype refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was highly correlated with the presence of clonal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased blasts were always associated with the presence of a clone, in contrast with dyserythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clones had gains of 1q and 3q and/or loss of 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotype complexity also correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One third of patients with 3q as a sole abnormality had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; patients with 3q and an additional abnormality <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data provide a rationale for integrating cytogenetic findings with independently evaluated morphologic findings for monitoring bone marrow status in FA </plain></SENT>
