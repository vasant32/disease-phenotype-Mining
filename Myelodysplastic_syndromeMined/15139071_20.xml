<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to investigate and characterize these rare SNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed clinical and treatment data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> institutional patients age &lt; 22 years at diagnosis of a primary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> who developed any type of SN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence rates were estimated, and putative risk factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNs investigated in the current study included 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> (42%), 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> (21%), 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_409'>fibrous histiocytoma</z:mpath>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had previously received radiotherapy, and 12 patients had received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SN was related to a genetic cause in 7 patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died of their SNs, including 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> and 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated 15-year cumulative incidence rate for malignant SNs was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085138" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroid plexus tumors</z:e> had an estimated 10-year cumulative incidence rate of 20.2%; 2 of those patients had germline TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age &lt;/= 2 years was a significant risk factor (P = 0.016) for development of an SN only when patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the estimated cumulative incidence of SNs was found among patients who had received different types of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of lethal SNs after pediatric <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Young patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085138" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroid plexus tumors</z:e> appear to have an increased risk of SNs that is associated with genetic factors </plain></SENT>
