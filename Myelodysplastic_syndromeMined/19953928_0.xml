<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis: Internet-based human gene expression open database was used to predict the genomic profiling by regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and gene expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And then possible target genes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> were screened to predict the feasibility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> combination regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, similar analysis of gene expression profiling was conducted to forecast the potential therapeutic drugs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical investigation: eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, non-responding to traditional drugs, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the latest WHO classification, the patients were divided into 7 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 2 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and 9 patients of refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distributions of age was 19-91 years old (mean: 79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 17 males and 1 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> plus recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) was used to treat the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration formula was as follows: the intravenous drip of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> at a dosage of 0.4 gram per day was given 5 days weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the subcutaneous injection of rhEPO at a dosage of 6 000 IU was given 3 times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effect was evaluated 2 weeks post-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 2.6 percent of human gene involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell cycle and differentiation was regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially, upregulation of ELK1 expression, which belongs to downstream functional gene of EPO pathway, and downregulation of Cyclin D1 expression were successfully predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on the potential therapeutic mechanism <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> plus EPO had dual effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, i. e. promotion of hematopoiesis and inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical investigation showed that the response rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, neutrophil and platelet were 83.3%, 66.7% and 55.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> plus EPO had better therapeutic effects than a single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully used bioinformatics analysis to screen target genes regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and optimize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> combination therapeutic regimen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics method is a convenient, economical and effective supplementary approach for studying the pathogenesis and therapeutics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
