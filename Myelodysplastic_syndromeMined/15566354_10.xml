<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L3MBTL represents a strong candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene since it lies within the common deleted region, is a member of the Polycomb-like family, encodes the human homologue of a Drosophila <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor and is expressed within haematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the structure of L3MBTL, identify two putative promoters each associated with two CpG islands and characterize a complex pattern of alternative splicing events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the gene in patients with and without a 20q deletion identified several polymorphisms but no acquired mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two CpG islands spanning promoter 2 undergo monoallelic methylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoietic cells consistent with imprinting of L3MBTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from patients with a 20q deletion retained either the methylated or unmethylated allele but retention of the methylated allele did not correlate with reduction in L3MBTL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of a correlation between L3MBTL methylation and transcription could be shown to reflect loss of imprinting in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results demonstrate that inactivation of L3MBTL is not a common occurrence in patients with a 20q deletion or in cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002872'>polycythaemia</z:mp> vera </plain></SENT>
