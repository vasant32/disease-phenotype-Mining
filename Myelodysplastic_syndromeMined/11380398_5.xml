<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of karyotypic patterns in a consecutive series of 389 adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Time period did not significantly influence the survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the analyses, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were subdivided into the cytogenetic subgroups used in the International Prognostic Scoring System, i.e. favourable [-Y, del(5q) or del(20q) as single aberrations or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, n = 241], poor [-7, del(7q), der(1;7) or complex karyotypes, i.e. &gt; or = three abnormalities, n = 89] and intermediate (other aberrations, n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival times correlated well with the prognostic subgroups, confirming that the cytogenetic classification was valid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expressed as hazard ratios (HRs), with the favourable subgroup as the reference, the intermediate and poor subgroup HRs increased to 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.1) and 3.2 (2.4-4.1) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, morphological subtype and smoking habits significantly modified this prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shorter survival was detected for men in the favourable and the intermediate subgroups, but not in the poor prognosis subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using women in the favourable subgroup as the reference and adjusting for age, the HR for men was 1.6 (1.2-2.1) in the favourable subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for smoking habits as well decreased the HR to 1.4 (1.1-2.0) and, when also excluding cases with del(5q) as the sole anomaly, no significant difference could be discerned [HR 1.2 (0.9-1.6], suggesting that the better outcome for women in the favourable subgroup was mainly as a result of the '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>' and to smoking habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the intermediate subgroup, the corresponding HRs were 3.0 (1.5-6.0) when adjusted for age and 2.7 (1.3-5.5) when also adjusted for smoking habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different survival times between men and women have never previously been reported for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although it remains to be elucidated whether environmental and/or constitutional factors cause the observed sex-related difference, these observations have obvious clinical ramifications, not least in designing and evaluating therapy protocols </plain></SENT>
