<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case, effector memory T (T(EM)) cells were expanded in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains uncertain whether the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was caused by the basic marrow defects or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, since CD8(+) perforin(+) T(EM) cells expanded in the bone marrow, as was previously described for 3 of our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>-associated PRCA, it is highly possible that the pathogenic mechanism of PRCA that is accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> is related to the expanded CD8(+) perforin(+) T(EM) cells in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-complicated case </plain></SENT>
