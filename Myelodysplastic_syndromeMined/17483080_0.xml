<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An 89-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and a poor performance status (4) underwent treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (mPSL) (125 mg/body), which resulted in a remarkable reduction of blast cells in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil counts were maintained or increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the suppression was of short duration, mPSL was useful for disease control because it selectively reduced blast counts while maintaining the patient's performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo and in vitro findings suggested that mPSL had direct inhibitory actions on the survival of blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this experience, we gave the same mPSL dose to other elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=5) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4 (n=1) who had a poor performance status (3 or higher) and appeared unable to tolerate standard cytotoxic chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selective and significant blast cell reduction was observed in 4 of the 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, whereas no effects were seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our experience is limited, these findings may provide a clue to understanding the mechanisms regulating the survival of blast cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and indicate that mPSL may provide a benefit to a subset of these patients </plain></SENT>
