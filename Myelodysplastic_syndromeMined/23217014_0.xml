<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R1) plays a crucial role in several signaling pathways and may act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the expression and methylation of the PLA2R1 gene in Jurkat and U937 leukemic cell lines and its methylation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sites of methylation of the PLA2R1 locus were identified by sequencing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-modified DNA fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis was then carried out to quantify PLA2R1 methylation at 5'-CpG sites identified with differences in methylation between healthy control subjects and leukemic patients using sequencing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-modified genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of PLA2R1 was found to be completely down-regulated in Jurkat and U937 cells, accompanied by complete methylation of PLA2R1 promoter and down-stream regions; PLA2R1 was re-expressed after exposure of cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MS-HRM analysis of the PLA2R1 locus in patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> indicated an average methylation of 28.9% Â± 17.8%, compared to less than 9% in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients the extent of PLA2R1 methylation significantly increased with disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, measurements of PLA2R1 methylation appeared useful for predicting responsiveness to the methyltransferase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, as a pre-emptive treatment to avoid hematological relapse in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study shows for the first time that PLA2R1 gene sequences are a target of hypermethylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which may have pathophysiological relevance for disease evolution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
