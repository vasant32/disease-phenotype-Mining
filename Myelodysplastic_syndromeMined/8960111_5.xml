<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we treated 53 myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with a low dose combination of cis-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (cRA, 20-40 mg/day) and 1,25 alpha (OH)2 cholecalciferol [(OH)2D3, 1-1.5 micrograms/day] +/- intermittent 6-thioguanine (30 mg/m2/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter was reserved for patients with bone marrow (BM) blast excess (&gt; or = 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated, without major toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 25 patients with BM blasts less than 5%, we observed one complete, eight partial and four minor responses (response rate 52%) with a median response duration of 8 months (2 +/- 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival, which did not correlate with response, is projected at 76 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients with BM blast excess (&gt; or = 5%), including three of the previous group who progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), were treated with the three-drug protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One complete, 12 partial and six minor responses were obtained (response rate 61%) with a median response duration of 6 months (2-29+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in survival (P &lt; 0.005) was observed between the 19 responders (median 25 months) and the 12 non-responders (median 9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the transfusion need was observed in 41% of the transfusion-dependent patients with blast excess and in 53% of those without blast excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, combined differentiating therapy seems more effective than previously reported single agent treatments and should be considered for a larger randomized study to assess its actual impact on survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
