<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, a general defect in the multipotent stem-cell compartment results in disturbed proliferation and differentiation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a number of genetic defects in myelodysplastic progenitor cells have been described, the intracellular signaling pathways underlying aberrant regulation of myelopoiesis remain relatively undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, an ex vivo differentiation system was used to selectively screen for molecules improving defective hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic CD34(+) progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells isolated from patients with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> showed impaired capacity to proliferate and differentiate as well as increased levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve the expansion and differentiation of the myelodysplastic CD34(+) progenitors, cells were treated with the p38MAPK pharmacological inhibitor SB203580, or retrovirally transduced to ectopically express active protein kinase B (PKB/c-akt), or the transcriptional regulators STAT5, C/EBPalpha or ID1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas treatment of progenitors with SB203580, PKB or STAT5 did not enhance neutrophil development, ID1- and C/EBPalpha-transduced cells exhibited increased granulocyte/macrophage colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha resulted in improved neutrophil maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that targeting the ID1 and C/EBPalpha transcriptional regulators may be of benefit in the design of novel therapies for low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
