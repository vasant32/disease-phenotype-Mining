<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify prognostic factors for survival and leukemic transformation, 235 untreated patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were analyzed in a single center retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To the well known FAB classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> a supplementary group of patients with pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (PSA) was added, characterized by the absence of dysplastic features of non-erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the morphological subtypes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), n = 55; PSA, n = 40; RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), n = 33; RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), n = 53; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T) n = 29; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), n = 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Having screened 28 clinical, cytological, and laboratory parameters by univariate analysis, multiple regression analysis identified six variables with independent prognostic value: percentage of bone marrow blasts, serum LDH activity, PSA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, age, and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If patients with PSA were excluded, the FAB classification no longer contributed independent prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this multivariate analysis, a simple scoring system was devised for predicting the survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A score of unity was allocated to each of the following parameters: bone marrow blasts greater than or equal to 5%, LDH greater than 200 U/I, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> less than or equal to 9 g/dl, and platelets less than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a function of their total score, patients were divided into three risk groups (group A, score 0; group B, score 1-2; group C, score 3-4), which differed significantly in both survival and rates of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival 2 years after diagnosis was 91% in group A, 52% in group B, and 9% in group C (p less than 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> at 2 years was 0, 19, and 54%, respectively (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of LDH enzyme levels qualified this scoring system for an accurate assessment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> whose prognosis is viewed too favorably when rated by other scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this score was able to identify those patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> who, without showing an excess of marrow blasts, have an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
