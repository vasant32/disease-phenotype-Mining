<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the cytogenetic pattern of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in Taiwanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A modified trypsin method of Seabright was used for G-banding of metaphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From October 1996 to January 1999, 111 children with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 73 patients had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and 63 of these patients had successful karyotyping of their leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 20 (30.3%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, five had hypodiploidy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had 45 chromosomes), five had low hyperdiploidy (47-50 chromosomes), 16 (24.2%) had high hyperdiploidy (&gt; 50 chromosomes), and 20 had pseudodiploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal translocation was identified in 24 (36.4%) of the ALL patients, 17 of whom had recurrent translocations including 10 with CD10+ B-precursor ALL [4 with t(9;22), 5 with t(1;19), and 1 infant with t(8;14)(q24;q11)], one neonate with CD10- early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> with t(4;11), three B-cell cases with t(8;14), and three T-cell cases [2 with t(11;19)(q23;p13), and 1 (11;14)(p13;q11)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One B-precursor patient had dic (9;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes of the 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) included eight with t(8;21); seven with the French-American-British-M2 subtype (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026999" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB-M2</z:e>) and one with M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of the patients with M3 had t(15;17), one patient with M4 had inv(16) and 7q-, one with M4Eo (M4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>) had t(7;16)(q21;q22), one with M0 had t(4;11)(q21;q23), and the remaining 11 had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of the five adult-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients had standard Philadelphia chromosome, and the other two had a variant-form of Philadelphia chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both of the patients with juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most findings were similar to previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026999" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB-M2</z:e> patients (7/8) with t(8;21) and the consequently higher frequency (26.7%) of this translocation in the 30 AML cases in this study might have significance, a larger series of cases is needed to establish this finding </plain></SENT>
