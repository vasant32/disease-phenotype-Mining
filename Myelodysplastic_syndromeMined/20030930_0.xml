<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marrow cells from 222 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, dysplastic changes in one or more hematopoietic lineages and blast cells less than 5% were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry(FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal immunophenotypes were evaluated in asynchronous antigen expression (CD34 or CD117 in mature granulocytes or mature monocytes, HLA-DR in mature granulocytes), in cross-lineage antigen expression (CD7 or CD56 in granulocytes or monocytes), in aberrant light-scatter (CD45/SSC in mature granulocyte or monocyte) and in abnormal expression of differentiation antigen (CD13/CD16 pattern in granulocytes and HLA-DR under-expression in monocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal immunophenotypes were determined on diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 222 cases, 127 cases were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by traditional diagnostic method and 95 cases were non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, autoimmune cytopenia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mature granulocyte gate, the sensitivity of asynchronous, cross-lineage antigen expression, aberrant light-scatter of CD45/SSC and abnormal expression of differentiation antigen were 31.5%, 30.7%, 49.6% and 60.6% respectively, and the specificity were 100%, 100%, 88.4% and 52.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In monocyte gate, the sensitivity of asynchronous, cross-lineage antigen expression, aberrant light-scatter of CD45/SSC and abnormal expression of differentiation antigen were 2.3%, 11%, 37% and 12.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 100% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 8 above mentioned items, sensitivity of more than 2 abnormalities was 77.9%, and specificity was 95.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 96.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the abnormal expression of asynchronous, cross-lineage antigen expression, aberrant light-scatter of CD45/SSC have a high specificity and a low sensitivity for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The abnormal expressions of differentiation antigens have a high sensitivity and a low specificity; however, the detection of multiple expression abnormalities possesses the high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
