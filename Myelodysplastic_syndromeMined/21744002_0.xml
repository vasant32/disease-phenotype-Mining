<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective multicentric study is to compare the peripheral blood and bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with ider(20q) (n = 13) and del(20q) (n = 21) and controls (n = 47) in order to investigate whether the ider(20q) harbors specific morphological features </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suspected ider(20q) by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> should therefore support targeted FISH tests in case of non informative karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This combined approach will allow a better estimation of the prevalence of this underdiagnozed entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival and progression-free survival did not statistically differ in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, hypogranulated and vacuolized neutrophils were significantly associated with survival </plain></SENT>
