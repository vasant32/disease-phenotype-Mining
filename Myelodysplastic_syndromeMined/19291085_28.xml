<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1273 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 62% (complete remission 54%, complete remission without platelet/neutrophil recovery 8%); 5-year survival was 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No benefits were observed in either dose escalation randomization, or from a fourth course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for inferior response in the PSC-833 arm due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified cytogenetics, presenting white blood count, age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> as the main predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although patients with high Pgp expression and function had worse response and survival, this was not an independent prognostic factor, and was not modified by PSC-833 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these four interventions have not improved outcomes in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New agents need to be explored and novel trial designs are required to maximise prospects of achieving timely progress </plain></SENT>
