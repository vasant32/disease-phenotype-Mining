<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was 6.5 g/dl, and the leukocyte and platelet counts were 2.85 × 10(9)/l and 55.5 × 10(9)/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level was high (3,204.5 IU/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum vitamin B(12) levels were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits at the initial evaluation, but a serial follow-up of the vitamin B(12) levels revealed either fluctuations or a gradual decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were initially diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and responded rapidly to a 7-day parenteral B(12) treatment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> complete blood counts (CBCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that patients suspected to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may suffer from vitamin B(12) deficiency and that this can be revealed by a normalization of CBCs following 7 days of treatment with parental vitamin B(12) </plain></SENT>
