<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) in combination with whole chromosome painting (WCP) in the detection of complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: M-FISH was used in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with R-banding CCAs to refine the complex chromosomal rearrangements, and to identify cryptic translocations and characterization of marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dual-color WCP procedures were further performed in 7 cases to confirm some rearrangements detected by M-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: M-FISH confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> results of R-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The composition and origin of 6 kinds of marker chromosomes, 9 kinds of chromosomes with additional material undetermined and 5 kinds of derivative chromosomes undefined by conventional cytogenetics (CC) were defined after M-FISH analysis; four kinds of cryptic translocations overlooked by CC were found on derivative chromosomes and previously <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, M-FISH revealed some nonrandom aberrations: aberrations involving chromosome 17 and -5/5q- were the two most frequent aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH were corrected by WCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: M-FISH is a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool in clarification of CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complementary WCP helps us to identify misclassified and missed chromosomal aberrations by M-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CC in combination with molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as M-FISH and WCP, can unravel complex chromosomal aberrations more precisely </plain></SENT>
