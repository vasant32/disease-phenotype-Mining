<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although diagnostic criteria are well established for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a significant number of patients have blood and bone marrow findings that make diagnosis and classification difficult </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to study hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow of 45 patients with straightforward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained in a series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, healthy donors, and patients with a history of nonmyeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were defined, and the diagnostic utility of flow cytometry was compared, with morphologic and cytogenetic evaluations in 20 difficult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics were adequate for diagnosis in most cases, flow cytometry could detect immunophenotypic abnormalities in cases when combined <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics were nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that flow cytometric immunophenotyping may help establish the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially when <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics are indeterminate </plain></SENT>
