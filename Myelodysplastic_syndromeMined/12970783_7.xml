<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 43% with no difference between the arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival times for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, CR patients, and non-CR patients were 280, 550, and 100 days, respectively, with no difference between the arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response rates were significantly better in patients with serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (S-LDH) levels &lt;/=9.5 microkat/l, bone marrow cellularity &lt;/=70%, and WBC counts &lt;4.0 x 10(9)/l, but S-LDH was the only variable independently associated with response by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox's regression analysis identified four significant prognostic factors for survival: bone marrow cellularity, S-LDH, cytogenetic risk group (International Prognostic Scoring System), and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only bone marrow cellularity (P=0.01) and S-LDH (P=0.0003) retained statistical significance in the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe adverse events were significantly more common in the GM-TAD arm (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, addition of GM-CSF to chemotherapy showed no clinical benefit in terms of response but carried an increased risk for side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We present a clinically useful tool to predict response to chemotherapy and survival in elderly patients with transforming <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, favoring patients with features of less proliferative disease </plain></SENT>
