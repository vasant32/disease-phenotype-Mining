<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA histograms were resolved into G0/1, S and G2/M compartments by fitting Gaussian distributions and the DNA content of G0/1 cells, expressed as DNA index (DI), was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 19 MDS patients the DI was outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, those with RA tending to be hyperdiploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> had a second G0/1 peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five cases of RA the number of cells in G0/1 was below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and the mean value was significantly lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for this group as a whole (P = 0 X 018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven (RA) patients had a higher percentage of cells in G2/M than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P = 0 001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients there is a suggestion of increased numbers in G0/1 and a decrease in S phase and G2/M cells </plain></SENT>
