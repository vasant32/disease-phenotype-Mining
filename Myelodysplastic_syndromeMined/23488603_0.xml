<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 93%, 79%, and 64%, respectively, with the median projected overall survival of 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (14%) had abnormal cytogenetics at any time during the disease course (no survival difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (12%) transformed during follow up, after a median of 8.5 years, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (4), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1); 8 had cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 133 patients, 39 were newly diagnosed: 33 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 6 with abnormal cytogenetics (no survival difference); 9 transformed (6 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 3 with abnormal cytogenetics at diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In keeping with other smaller series, the presence of chromosomal abnormalities may have a role in the transformation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>; survival was not affected likely due to short follow up </plain></SENT>
