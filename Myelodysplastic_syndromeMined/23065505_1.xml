<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of the World Health Organization 2008 classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is uncertain and its assessment was the major aim of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The different peripheral blood and bone marrow variables required for an adequate morphological classification were blindly evaluated by four cytomorphologists in samples from 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of agreement among observers was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient and the generalized kappa statistic for multiple raters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of agreement for the percentages of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood, ring sideroblasts in bone marrow, and erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic dysplastic cells was strong (P&lt;0.001 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After stratifying the percentages according to the categories required for the assignment of World Health Organization subtypes, the degree of agreement was not statistically significant for cases with 5-9% blasts in bone marrow (P=0.07), 0.1-1% blasts in peripheral blood (P=0.47), or percentage of erythroid dysplastic cells (P=0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the interobserver concordance for World Health Organization-defined subtypes showed a moderate overall agreement (P&lt;0.001), the reproducibility being lower for cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts type 1 (P=0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the reproducibility of the World Health Organization 2008 classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is acceptable but the defining criteria for blast cells and features of erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> need to be refined </plain></SENT>
