<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smad5 is a member of the signal transducer family conveying the pleiotropic TGF-gb/BMP cytokine signals with roles in development, cell growth control, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present a study of the Smad5 expression and its functional role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines as well as in primary CD34+ progenitors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent Smad5 gene expression in these cell types and the gradual increase in its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in a model of induced erythroid differentiation of murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (MEL) cells suggest a role of the gene in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) directs Smad5 activation in human hematopoietic cells, as monitored at the levels of protein phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and specific transcription response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CD34+ cells by BMP4 results in significantly increased proliferation of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and formation of glycophorin-A+ cells, whereas perturbation of Smad5 expression by antisense oligonucleotides causes significantly decreased rates of BMP4-induced erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have not detected any effects of Smad5 inhibition on BMP4-stimulated progenitors of the granulocyteNmacrophage lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that the BMP4/Smad5 signal transduction pathway activates hematopoietic differentiation programs that may be impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> manifestations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with Smad5 haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
