<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> is closely related to the oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity of neutrophils, and, hence, can be utilized as an index to indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This neutrophil function can be determined easily in ordinary clinical facilities by using flow cytometry, and care should be taken to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> production is reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
