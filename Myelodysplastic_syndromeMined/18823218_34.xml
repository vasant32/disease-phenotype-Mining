<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic subanalysis of a phase III, prospective, randomized, multicenter, evaluator-blinded trial comparing posaconazole with standard azoles (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who received posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg 3 times/day with meals or a <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplement</z:chebi> for a minimum of 7 days to achieve steady state and for a maximum of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: For the first 20 patients, blood samples were collected before the first dose on day 8 and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after that first dose; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients, blood samples were collected at 1 and 3 hours after the first dose on day 8 and during the first episode of evaluation for a possible IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The effects of the following covariates on average (Cav) and maximum (Cmax) posaconazole plasma concentrations at steady state were explored: age, sex, and race-ethnicity; proven or probable IFI; baseline body weight and body surface area; and baseline (on or before day 7) increases in liver enzyme levels, mucositis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, or use of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonist</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> use, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase level of 2 or more times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and race-ethnicity reduced Cav </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although statistically significant, these results were not considered clinically significant and did not necessitate posaconazole dosage adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean Cav and Cmax values did not appear different in the six patients with IFIs (three with proven IFIs, three with probable IFIs) compared with the entire sample of 194 patients; however, a definitive conclusion cannot be made due to the small sample size of patients with IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No factor found to affect posaconazole concentrations predominated in patients with IFIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral posaconazole 200 mg 3 times/day provided plasma concentrations adequate for preventing IFIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No dosage adjustments are recommended based on any covariate tested </plain></SENT>
