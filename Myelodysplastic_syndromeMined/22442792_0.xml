<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule on mesenchymal stromal cells from the bone marrow of patients and healthy donors was evaluated after 2-4 passages by the methods of immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 expression in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> was lower than in healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, VCAM-1 expression was not identified on mesenchymal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 expression on cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> did not differ from that in healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that VCAM-1 synthesis in bone marrow stromal cells is impaired in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes can be followed by the loss of relationships between hemopoietic cells and stromal microenvironment in bone marrow niches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemopoietic cells gain the ability for uncontrolled growth, which results in progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
