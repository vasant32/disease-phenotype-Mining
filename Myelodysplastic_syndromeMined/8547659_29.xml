<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with 12p abnormalities were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes mapped to specific regions in 12p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial analysis using the YAC 964c10 (D12S736) revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases with cytogenetically identified del(12p) had lost one copy of this YAC and that submicroscopic deletions had occurred in 10 of the 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with other 12p abnormalities, ie, translocations, additions, and insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletions were partially mapped with cosmids localized to subregions of 12p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One copy of the gene for p27kip1 (KIP1), involved in cell cycle entrance, was found to be lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which deletions could be detected by other probes and in one case with a translocation as the only detectable change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This implicates KIP1 as a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene affected by del(12p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four translocations with no apparent concomitant deletions were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four breakpoints resulted in a split D12S736 signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of these cases, we showed that <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> was disrupted as a result of a t(5;12)(q32-33;p12) and a t(12;22)(p12;q12), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>--one non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--with 12p amplifications were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases cyclin D2 (CCND2) was within the amplified region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, cytogenetic abnormalities of 12p in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> result in at least three different molecular changes: deletions of KIP1, amplifications of CCND2, and structural rearrangements of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
