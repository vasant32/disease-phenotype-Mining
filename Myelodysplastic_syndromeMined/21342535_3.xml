<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSS) are pre-leukemic disorders with increasing incident rates worldwide, but very limited treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about small regulatory <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> and how they contribute to pathogenesis, progression and transcriptome changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients' primary marrow cells were screened for short <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-seq) using next generation sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exon arrays from the same cells were used to profile gene expression and additional measures on 98 patients obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Integrative bioinformatics algorithms were proposed, and pathway and ontology analysis performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, observations implied extensive post-transcriptional regulation via microRNAs (miRNA) and the recently discovered Piwi interacting <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (piRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large expression differences were found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated and novel miRNAs, including 48 sequences matching to miRNA star (miRNA*) motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detected species were predicted to regulate disease stage specific molecular functions and pathways, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, results suggested extensive post-translation editing via <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17843">transfer RNAs</z:chebi> (tRNAs), providing a potential link for <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp>, a hallmark for this disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis confirmed important regulatory roles for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> linked miRNAs and TFs, and strengthened the biological significance of miRNA* </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The "<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II promoters" were identified as the tightest controlled biological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest their control by a miRNA dominated feedback loop, which might be linked to the dramatically different miRNA amounts seen between low and high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The presented results provide novel findings that build a basis of further investigations of diagnostic biomarkers, targeted therapies and studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
