<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 34 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, 11 achieved complete remission (CR) and six achieved partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CR rate of patients whose blasts had Auer bodies was significantly higher than that of the patients whose blasts did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the duration of remission was generally short, the overall survival was longer in the responders (CR cases + PR cases) than in the nonresponders </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of seven patients treated with a combination low-dose therapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, two achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical data in some cases suggested that blasts differentiate into mature myeloid cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-dose chemotherapy is one therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the therapy should be conducted to increase the CR rate and to prolong the duration of CR </plain></SENT>
