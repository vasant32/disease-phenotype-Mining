<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the importance of mismatch repairing genes in keeping the genetic stability in cells, any alterations in their structure or function could generate instability in the genome and predispose the development of oncogenic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>hMSH2 is the principal gene involved in the post-replicating DNA mismatch repair system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, exon 13 of the hMSH2 gene was analyzed in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our work was to determine the association between the presence of polymorphisms in this region with the development of alterations in the hematological system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 227 samples including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and myelodysplasic syndromes, where analyzed by PCR-SSCP followed by automated sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism was found in 30 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is a T to C substitution at the -6 intronic splice acceptor site of exon 13 of hMSH2 gene [gIVS12-6T &gt; C] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group the polymorphism frequency found was 0.09, with statistical significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) when compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the frequency of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group was the same of that of the control group (0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings agree with previous research results of other investigation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a probable association of the polymorphism with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
