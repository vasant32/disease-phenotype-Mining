<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> caused by defective erythropoietin (Epo) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 34 recipients of an allogeneic HSCT in three consecutive trials to determine the optimal utilization of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) therapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first trial (n = 7), rhEpo 1400 U/kg/week was given from day 1 until a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) level of 10 g/dL was achieved, for a maximum of 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second trial, rhEpo 500 U/kg/week was given to achieve Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL in 13 anemic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> 56 to 1440 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the third trial, rhEpo was scheduled to start on day 35 in 14 patients at a dose of 500 U/kg/week with the aim of achieving Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In trial 1, erythroid recovery to 1% reticulocytes and red blood cell transfusion independence were faster, but the number of transfusions was not reduced compared to 10 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were brisk in trial 2, with transfusion independence achieved after a median of 1 week in 12 of 13 patients, and 2-g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 6, 7, 10, and 10 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfusions were significantly reduced in the first month of rhEpo therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In trial 3, transfusion independence was obtained after a median of 1 week in 13 of 14 patients, and 2-g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transfusions rates were considerably reduced compared to the previous month in the same patients or compared to controls undergoing peripheral blood or marrow transplant without rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> after allogeneic HSCT is exquisitely sensitive to rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The benefit is minimal when it is given early post-transplant, as used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the rate of major response is greater than 90% when rhEpo is started after day 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data provide the basis on which to conduct a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of rhEpo therapy after allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
