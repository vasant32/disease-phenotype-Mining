<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The red cell ferritin (rFt) level in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) was measured and analyzed by column isoelectric focusing (IEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels in 9 of the 10 patients (90.0%) were higher than the upper limit in healthy controls (MV +/- SD: male 14.3 +/- 10.3 ag/cell, female 7.5 +/- 3.6 ag/cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The isoelectric point (pI) of rFt determined by IEF in healthy subjects ranged from 5.1 to 5.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the pI ranges for RA patients varied widely; the pI value was thought to correlate with the severity of the morphological abnormalities of bone marrow (BM) erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>That is, the greater the proportion of morphologically abnormal erythroblasts with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> erythroid precursors, the lower the pI range for rFt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rFt content was not related to serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, reticulocyte count, red cell iron content, or BM erythroblast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that rFt synthesis in RA patients is influenced by factor(s) other than iron; this is considered an essential feature of erythropoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
