<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival of the entire group was 74 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfusion-dependent patients had a median survival of 44 months vs 97 months for transfusion-independent patients (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfusion need at diagnosis was the most important patient characteristic for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 381 patients, 48 (12.6%) progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
