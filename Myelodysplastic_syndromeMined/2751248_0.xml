<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were six deletions, one ring chromosome and five reciprocal translocations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involving a chromosome band 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these twelve patients, five had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and seven a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RA was associated more frequently with 11q deletions as the sole abnormality, while translocations or multiple chromosome abnormalities were commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study shows that the 11q aberrations represent frequent structural chromosome rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
