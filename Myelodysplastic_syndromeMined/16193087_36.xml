<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) is considered the gold standard for risk assessment in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This score includes several prognostic factors except serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prognostic power of LDH as an additional variable in IPSS-based risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, a total of 892 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> registered by the Austrian-German cooperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> study group was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed the value of established parameters such as medullary blasts, karyotype and peripheral cell counts and showed that elevated LDH was associated with decreased overall survival (P&lt;0.00005) and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development (P&lt;0.00005), independent of the system used to classify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (FAB or WHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, elevated LDH was found to be a significant predictor of poor survival within each IPSS risk group and within each FAB group except <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To exploit these results for refined prognostication, each IPSS risk group was split into two separate categories (A=<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LDH vs B=elevated LDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this LDH-assisted approach, it was possible to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with unfavorable prognosis within the low and intermediate IPSS risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the IPSS+LDH score should improve clinical decision-making and facilitate proper risk stratification in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
