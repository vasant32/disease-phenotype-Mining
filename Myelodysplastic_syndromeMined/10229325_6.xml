<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that the levels of hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) are greatly reduced in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, only limited information exists on the growth kinetics of these cells in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC), particularly in terms of erythroid and multipotent progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have determined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> content in the bone marrow of 12 MDS patients and followed the proliferation kinetics of myeloid (including granulocyte, macrophage and granulocyte macrophage), erythroid (including early and late) and multipotent progenitor cells in LTMC throughout a 7-week culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the non-adherent and adherent fractions of the cultures were analyzed, so we were able to look at progenitor cells in suspension and those that physically associated to the stromal cell layer developed in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients were grouped based on their FAB subtype and the in vitro growth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> was analyzed accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results presented here indicate that in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, pronounced deficiencies exist both in the content and the long-term proliferation of marrow <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such deficiencies were particularly evident for multipotent progenitors and those committed to the erythroid lineage, in which alterations in the maturation process also seem to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, at least in some patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>--besides showing an impaired proliferative capacity--lose their ability to adhere to the stromal cell layers developed in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RA patients showed the less affected in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> growth, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t showed a markedly deficient growth in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, myelopoiesis was significantly increased in cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results give some new insights into the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
