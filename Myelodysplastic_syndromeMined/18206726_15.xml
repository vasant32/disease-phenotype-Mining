<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although clinically approved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> has not been well understood at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at characterizing the mechanisms for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as well as the presence of a possible link between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and DNA hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on a spectrum of specific apoptotic pathways, as well as on global DNA methylation, assessed by luminometric methylation assay, in myeloid (P39, HL60) and T cells (Jurkat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-Azacytidine</z:chebi> induced dose-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as non-dose-dependent global DNA hypomethylation at concentrations &gt;or=0.5 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation was observed in the sorted apoptotic fraction (41% decrease with 1 microM after 24 hours), while nonapoptotic cells retained a methylation pattern similar to untreated cells (+/-6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induced apoptotic pattern involved several pathways: cleavage of Bcl-2 family proteins, activation of caspase-2 and -3-like, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> involvement characterized by loss of transmembrane potential (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52282">tetramethylrhodamine</z:chebi> ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> [TMRE]) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> release, and acidification of cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selective inhibition of caspase-3-like, -2, -8, -9, and pan-caspase activity, as well as stabilization of cytosolic pH by monensin completely failed to block <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors only partially inhibited loss of TMRE (32% reduction) and caspase-2 activity (38% reduction); indicative of PARP operation (or action) upstream of caspase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> induced a similar degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while leaving methylation status mainly unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-Azacytidine</z:chebi> acts via multiple and separately regulated pathways, including parallel induction of hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The broad action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> may explain its therapeutic effects in poor-prognostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
