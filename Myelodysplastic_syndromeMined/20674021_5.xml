<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> cycles given to 28 patients was 131, and febrile episodes occurred in 15 cycles (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic prophylaxis was orally administered in 95 cycles (72.5%) </plain></SENT>
