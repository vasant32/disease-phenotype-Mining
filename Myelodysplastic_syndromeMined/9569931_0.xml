<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem cell transplantation has therefore been suggested as a potential means of increasing treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared with bone marrow stem cell autografts, peripheral stem cell autografts have a higher harvesting yield and a shorter duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> after reinjection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the results reported herein suggest that polyclonal stem cells harvested after chemotherapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and growth factor therapy are capable of ensuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and may provide prolonged remissions in some patients </plain></SENT>
