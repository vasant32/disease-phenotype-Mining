<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were randomized to either begin therapy with pentoxifylline, ciprofloxacin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (PCD) immediately (10 patients) or after a 12 week observation period (control arm, 15 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PCD was administered with the goal of suppressing cytokine-induced excessive intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No marked fluctuations of blood counts were noted during the period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients completed at least 12 weeks of therapy: 18/22 showed some type of hematologic response, 9/18 showing an improvement in absolute neutrophil count only (p = &lt; 0.001) and 9/18 showing multi-lineage responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No unique category of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> responded better, however 19/25 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA)/RA with ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 6 weeks and 3/18 responding patients maintained their responses beyond a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hematologic improvement in response to PCD therapy supports the validity of this unique anti-cytokine approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future trials should combine PCD therapy with established approaches (growth factors/chemotherapy) and also should focus on identifying more effective ways of suppressing the pro-apoptotic cytokines in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
