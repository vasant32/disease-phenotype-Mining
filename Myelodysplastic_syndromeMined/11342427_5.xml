<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of substance P (SP), a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with pleiotropic functions, was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of its functions-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_180'>fibroblast proliferation</z:mpath>, and stimulation of BM progenitors-are amenable to inducing BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a significant increase was found in SP-immunoreactivity (SP-IR) in the sera of patients with BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 44) compared with the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and no histologic evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 46) (140 +/-12 vs 18 +/-3; P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of sera SP indicated that this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exists in the form of a complex with other molecule(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was, therefore, hypothesized that SP might be complexed with NK-1, its natural receptor, or with a molecule homologous to NK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address this, 3 cDNA libraries were screened that were constructed from pooled BM stroma or mononuclear cells with an NK-1 cDNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A partial clone (clone 1) was retrieved that was 97% homologous to the ED-A region of fibronectin (FN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sequence analyses indicated that clone 1 shared significant homology with exon 5 of NK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated co-migration of SP and FN in 27 of 31 patients with BM <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted molecular modeling suggested that similar secondary structural features between FN and NK-1 and the relative electrostatic charge might explain a complex formed between FN (negative) and SP (positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that SP may be implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, though its role would have to be substantiated in future research </plain></SENT>
