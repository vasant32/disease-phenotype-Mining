<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But many potentially informative mutations in such genes are lethal early in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, inherited mutations may not reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the functional roles of such proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acquired, somatic defects should reflect a wider spectrum of mutations because they are not prone to negative selection in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been difficult to identify such mutations so far, but microarray analysis provides a new opportunity to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we have shown that in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha-thalassemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATMDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of the gene encoding the chromatin remodeling factor ATRX cause an unexpectedly severe hematological phenotype compared with the wide spectrum of inherited mutations affecting this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings cast new light on this pleiotropic cofactor, which appears to be an essential component rather than a mere facilitator of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene expression </plain></SENT>
