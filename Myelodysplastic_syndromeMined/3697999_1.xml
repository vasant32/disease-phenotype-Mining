<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined the ability of pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated human spleen cells to support the growth and proliferation of hemopoietic progenitors from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients, in the presence and absence of the maturation-inducing agents <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vit D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of various concentrations of vit D or RA to culture plates containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' marrow cells stimulated myeloid colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A higher number of myeloid colony-forming units-cell was noted in cultures containing vit D or RA in addition to pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> spleen-conditioned medium compared to these substances and placenta conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When colony-forming units-cell from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was incubated with 2 X 10(-8) M vit D the percentage of monocyte-macrophage colonies was increased and the number of granulocyte colonies was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither vit D nor RA affected the number of cells per colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> spleen-conditioned medium provides a more potent source than placenta-conditioned medium for humoral factors that stimulate the growth of hemopoietic progenitors from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and that the use of pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> spleen-conditioned medium may improve studies of hemopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
