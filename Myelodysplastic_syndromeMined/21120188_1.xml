<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) has been used as a standard myeloablative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies postulate that fludarabine (Flu) is a less toxic substitute for Cy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and received BuFlu (n=17) or BuCy (n=25) from August, 1999 to July, 2009 at Dong-A University Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 39.75 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BuFlu group showed a lower incidence of mucositis (P=0.005), but there was no significant intergroup difference in the time of engraftment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic veno-occlusive disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the 2 groups showed no significant difference in the cumulative risk of relapse, event-free survival, or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BuFlu administration can be employed as a preparative regimen for allogeneic HSCT and shows efficacy and transplant-adverse effects comparable to those of BuCy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, randomized prospective studies in more patients are warranted </plain></SENT>
