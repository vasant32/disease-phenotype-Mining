<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a differentiating agent, interferon alpha 2a (INF alpha) has been shown to be active in the correction of cytopenias related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical course of 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with low-dose subcutaneous INF alpha (1 x 10(6), 3 times per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was only demonstrated in one patient (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other, eight, therapy was totally ineffective and four of them could not receive the complete treatment due to worsening cytopenias or leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
