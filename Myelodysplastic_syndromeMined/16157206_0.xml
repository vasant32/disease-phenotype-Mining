<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular characterization of the 7p15 breakpoint showed that this was localized within a fully sequenced PAC clone RP1-170O19 containing the HOXA4 to HOXA13 genes and the EVX1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 9q34 breakpoint was mapped distal to ABL1 and proximal to NOTCH1 excluding their involvement as fusion gene partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a causal role for HOXA genes in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and warrant investigation of this locus in a larger series of patients </plain></SENT>
