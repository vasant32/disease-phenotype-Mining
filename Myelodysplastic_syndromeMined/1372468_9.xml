<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of an epidemiological survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in southern Tasmania, 62 MDS patients identified over a 2 year period were tested for the presence of CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen (HPCA), in their peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and patient survival, and CD34+ status was compared as a prognostic indicator with Bournemouth score, cytogenetics, and CFU-GM colony growth which were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating CD34+ cells were found in 23 of the 62 MDS patients; 9 of the 23 patients with circulating CD34+ cells transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as compared with none of the 39 CD34 negative patients (P less than 0.0001); and 11 of the 23 patients with circulating CD34+ cells were dead at the end of the 2 year period, as opposed to 6 of the 39 with no CD34+ cells (P less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Bournemouth score was also significantly associated with transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P less than 0.0001) and poor survival (P less than 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were the only significant associations of the possible prognostic factors studied with either transformation or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, the presence of circulating CD34+ cells was significantly associated with both progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and poor survival and was found to be a better prognostic indicator than cytogenetics or CFU-GM colony growth </plain></SENT>
