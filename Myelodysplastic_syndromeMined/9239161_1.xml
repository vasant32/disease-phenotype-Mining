<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 15 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> including 7 de novo cases and 8 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 14 patients had complications, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> showed high peripheral WBC counts and higher cellularity of bone marrow than those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, it was difficult in some cases to distinguish these types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from hematological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 AML cases, three had entered complete remission (CR) by a standard dose of combination chemotherapy (BHAC-DMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One CR patient has had CR for more than 9 years now with good QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 patients treated by low-dose Ara-C, one attained CR but only for a short period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four other patients received BRM, such as G-CSF or Ubenimex, and 2 patients died without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at more than 80 years of age is a highly heterogenous disease, it would be reasonable to give antileukemic agents according to the individual patient's condition </plain></SENT>
