<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The safety and possible efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) were evaluated in 40 consecutive patients who received transplants from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rhGM-CSF was administered by 2-hour daily intravenous infusion from day 0 to day 20 or day 27 after the marrow infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 78 historical patients who received transplants from unrelated donors who did not receive rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rhGM-CSF-treated patients were older (P = .037) and were treated less frequently in laminar air flow rooms (P = .005) than were control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the rhGM-CSF-treated group had a higher proportion of "good risk" patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (P = .006) than did the comparison group (P = .017), rendering comparisons of transplant-related complications not meaningful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rhGM-CSF was well tolerated and did not adversely increase the incidence of graft rejection or increase the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median day the absolute neutrophil count reached 500/mm3 in patients who received rhGM-CSF was day 21, which was not different from that of historical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the numbers of febrile days and septicemic episodes within the first 28 days in patients who received rhGM-CSF were less than in historical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of nonrelapse mortality at 1 year in patients who received rhGM-CSF was 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In view of the retrospective nature of the control group, we cannot conclusively determine whether rhGM-CSF administration was beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prospective, randomized controlled study of rhGM-CSF is required to confirm these suggestive data </plain></SENT>
