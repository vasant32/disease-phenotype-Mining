<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was done to assess the impact of the HCT-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) in addition to other pre-transplant factors on the outcome of RIC transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 121 such patients were transplanted between 2002 and 2008 at two centers using fludarabine, melphalan and alumtuzumab conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The OS and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 56% and 30% at 2 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NRM of patients with HCT-CI ≥ 3 was not significantly different from the NRM of those with HCT-CI 0-2 (P value 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age and disease status at transplantation were significant factors affecting OS (P value 0.07 and 0.008, respectively), with no impact on NRM (P value 0.14 and 0.24, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although HCT-CI on its own did not independently predict NRM or survival, taken together with age and disease status at transplantation, it can be utilized to further delineate RIC allograft recipients into groups with different outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with none or one of these three adverse factors (age ≥ 60 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in second CR or PR/high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and HCT-CI ≥ 3) had a 2-year NRM and survival of 18% and 80%, respectively, which was significantly better than those of patients with two or more of these adverse factors with 2-year NRM and survival of 46% (P value 0.03) and 40% (P value 0.02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three adverse factors (age ≥ 60 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in second CR or PR/high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and HCT-CI ≥ 3) had survived for 2 years (median survival 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This information can be used to guide patient selection for RIC transplants and to appropriately counsel patients of the risks and benefits of this treatment </plain></SENT>
