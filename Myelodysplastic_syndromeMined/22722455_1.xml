<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to assess current diagnosis and treatment patterns in Germany, the data of 269 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from 57 representative centers were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common symptom leading to an initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WHO classification, cytogenetic analysis, and IPSS scoring were performed in 92, 67, and 61% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5q deletions were identified in 34% of patients whose cytogenetic status was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was the major trigger for initiating therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>49% of patients received supportive care only, and 49% received active therapy (i.e., chemo-, immunomodulatory, or epigenetic therapy), including 5% who received allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those patients treated with active therapy, approximately half of the higher-risk patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, and approximately half of the lower-risk patients received lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 80% of patients received some form of supportive care, mainly red blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While the WHO classification system is widely used in clinical practice, karyotyping and IPSS risk assessment do not seem to be common standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite encouraging data on the use of effective and novel drugs, such as lenalidomide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> therapies, management of the disease could be further improved by more widespread use of risk stratification of patients using cytogenetics and IPSS assessment </plain></SENT>
