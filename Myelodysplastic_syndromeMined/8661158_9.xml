<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of a novel gene, MLF2, which contains an open reading frame of 744 bp encoding a 248-amino-acid protein highly related to the previously identified MLF1 protein (63% similarity, 40% identity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the tissue-restricted expression pattern of MLF1, the MLF2 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> is expressed ubiquitously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MLF2 gene locus was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to human chromosome 12p13, a chromosomal region frequently involved in translocations and deletions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> of lymphoid or myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a physical map of chromosome 12, MLF2 was found to reside on the yeast artificial chromosome clone 765b9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting analysis of malignant cell DNAs prepared from a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cases with translocations involving chromosome arm 12p, as well as a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> with various cytogenetic abnormalities, failed to reveal MLF2 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
