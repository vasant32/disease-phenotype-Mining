<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was obtained in sixteen patients (33%) and partial remission (PR) in six (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight patients with hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> entered CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, LDAC was not effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ANLL developing from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of remission was 7 months (range: 3-20 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of the sixteen patients who achieved CR were received LDAC at the same dose for 10 days every month as a maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
