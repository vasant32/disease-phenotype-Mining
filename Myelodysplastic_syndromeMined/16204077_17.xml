<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of the p38 pathway in the generation of the effects of myelosuppressive cytokines on human hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 using BIX-01208 resulted in reversal of IFN-, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-mediated suppression of human erythroid (blast-forming unit-erythroid) and myeloid (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit) colony formation, consistent with a key role for p38 in the generation of myelosuppressive signals by different cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the myelosuppressive effects of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta were reversed by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> targeting p38alpha expression, further establishing the requirement of this kinase in the induction of myelosuppressive responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As TNF overproduction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> states, we determined whether pharmacologic inhibition of p38 reverses the hematopoietic defects seen in bone marrows from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of pharmacologic inhibitors of p38 on such bone marrows resulted in increased numbers of erythroid and myeloid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, inhibition of the activity of the downstream effectors of p38, MAPK activated protein kinase-2, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> and stress activated kinase 1 partially restored the hematopoietic defect seen in these bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken altogether, our data implicate the p38 MAPK in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo> and suggest that p38 pharmacologic inhibitors may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
