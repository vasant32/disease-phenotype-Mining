<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was defined by a rise in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration to 9-11 g/dl and/or a reduction in the transfusion requirement during the treatment period compared with the 12 weeks before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients completed the 12-week treatment and 4 were still under treatment, 1 at 10 weeks, 2 at 8 weeks and 1 at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only those patients completing treatment were included in the efficacy evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment there was no significant change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations, reticulocyte counts, or transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the number of patients included is too low to allow any definitive conclusion to be made </plain></SENT>
