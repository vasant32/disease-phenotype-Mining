<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic aberrations, including rearrangements, deletions, and amplifications of chromosome 12p, have been documented in B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, rearrangements targeting <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> have rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that had a complex karyotype including t(9;12)(q22;p13), which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization to represent rearrangement of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional cytogenetic abnormalities included t(3;14)(q27;q32) involving the variant, alternative breakpoint region of the BCL6 gene and del(6)(q13q23), resulting in the loss of 1 allele of BLIMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case reiterates the importance of correlating morphologic and phenotypic findings with the results of cytogenetic analysis to avoid errors in diagnosing hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and highlights the rare association of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with aberrations of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
