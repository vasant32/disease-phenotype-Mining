<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case of a 62-year-old Japanese male with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and a Philadelphia (Ph)-like chromosome, which probably involved bands 11q23 and 22q11, is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed a Ph chromosome as well as -5, -7, +8, +11, -16, and an extra Ph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of the cells had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis using breakpoint cluster region probes (5' bcr and 3' bcr) did not detect a rearrangement within the bcr DNA sequences, indicating that the breakpoint at 22q11 occurred outside the bcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the bone marrow cells from this patient did not express an 8.5-kb c-abl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Ph chromosome in this case differs from that of Ph-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and the present case suggests that we should retain the term of "Ph-like chromosome" in such cases </plain></SENT>
