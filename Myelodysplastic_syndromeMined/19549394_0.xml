<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allo-HSCT without T lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was used in 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from November 1999 to June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4 cases out of them received allo-PBSCT from HLA matched sibling donors with conditioning regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) and Bu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was prevented by the administration of immunosuppressive drugs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) and short-course MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 patients received haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (hi-alloBMT) after preconditioning with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (TBI) with a linear accelerator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GVHD was prevented by the administration of immunosuppressive drugs including CSA, short-course MTX, MMF, anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody and ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients were engrafted successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time of granulocyte recovery exceeding 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets exceeding 20 x 10(9)/L were days 15 and 20.3 respectively, and 100% donor hematological cells were detected by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients did not experience serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 18 - 108 months of following-up, 2 cases died of pulmonary complication and of relapse; the other 4 cases survive in a disease-free situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, allo-HSCT was an effective approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
