<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, randomized studies comparing front-line rHEPO vs rHEPO+G-CSF are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of "standard" doses of rHEPO with the combination of rHEPO and G-CSF in the treatment of anemic patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in a prospective randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anemic patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive either rHEPO (10,000 IU s.c. three times a week) or the same dosage of rHEPO+G-CSF (300 mug s.c. twice a week) for a minimum of 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who were unresponsive to rHEPO were offered the combination therapy for another 8 weeks, whereas non-responders to rHEPO+G-CSF were considered "off study" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders continued the treatment indefinitely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both haematological response and changes in quality-of-life (QoL) scores (Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>) were recorded and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty consecutive patients [10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 5 RA with ringed sideroblasts, 7 refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 5 RA with less than 10% blasts and 3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>] were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them (15 in the rHEPO arm and 15 in the rHEPO+G-CSF arm) were valuable after the first 8 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erythroid response was observed in 6/15 (40%) patients in the rHEPO arm and in 11/15 (73.3%) patients in the rHEPO+G-CSF arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 4/9 (44.4%) patients who were unresponsive to rHEPO, the addition of G-CSF induced erythroid response at 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No relevant adverse effects were recorded for either treatment in any of the study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Erythroid response to HGF was associated with a relevant improvement in QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty responders continued the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, 8/20 (40%) discontinued therapy because of the following: losing response (2), progression to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to other causes (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 are still responding and continuing treatment, with a median follow-up of 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was cumulatively observed in 4/30 (13.3%) patients (2 in each arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although our data were obtained from a relatively small cohort of patients, they indicate that the rHEPO+G-CSF treatment is more effective than rHEPO alone for correcting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and for making a relevant improvement in their QoL </plain></SENT>
