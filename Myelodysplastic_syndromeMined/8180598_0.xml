<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a need for decision models both for predicting the natural course of the disease and the outcomes of different treatment alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 102 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, pre-treatment variables were studied in relation to the response to treatment with low-dose ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (29%) responded with either a complete remission or a significant rise in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 71%, the treatment was ineffective and in some cases hazardous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with a poor response to treatment could be divided into two groups: one included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> and the presence of chromosomal aberrations, both signs of progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a short survival, and the other comprised morphological findings, indicating ineffective hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with platelet counts &gt; 150 x 10(9)/l had a response rate of 55%, compared to 24% in patients with subnormal platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression identified low bone marrow cellularity, absence of ring sideroblasts and &lt; 2 chromosomal aberrations as predictors of a favourable response in patients with platelet counts &lt; 150 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These factors and the platelet count were combined in a predictive model which divided patients into three groups with different probabilities of response: one favourable (38% of the patients), with a response rate of &gt; 50%; a second, intermediate group (33% of the patients), with a response rate of 24%; and a third, unfavourable group (29% of the patients) with only 3% responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
