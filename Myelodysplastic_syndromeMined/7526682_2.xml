<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SCF as a single factor did not induce significant colony formation, and even in the presence of rhEPO or rhG-CSF it very weakly stimulated erythroid colony formation and was rarely capable of inducing myeloid colony formation by clonogenic leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In culture dishes supplemented with SCF, both myeloid and erythroid colony formations were dramatically enhanced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, regarding both colony number and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colony-formation abilities by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors were improved following costimulation with SCF and rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SCF may have a therapeutic role in restoring hematopoiesis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
