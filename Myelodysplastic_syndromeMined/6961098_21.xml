<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 14 patients with "pure" <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and their clinical and haematological data are analysed in order to clarify the possible implications of this chromosome anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following points are considered: 1) In spite of the apparent variability of clinical forms in which <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 is found, several characteristics are common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 patients, i.e. the presence of a preleukaemic phase and blood and marrow features suggesting the early involvement in the disease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> marrow cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The different diagnoses associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 are correlated with different steps of a unique <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> whose typical course can be reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 has a negative prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When it is found in a preleukaemic disorder it indicates a high risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, while in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> it implies <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>recurrent infections</z:hpo>, poor response to therapy and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3) The significance of the lack of Colton blood group antigens in <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 patients is discussed, with particular regard to the fact that the patients in whom this lack was found are the only ones who had not received transfusions in the months before the tests were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) The finding of defective neutrophil chemotaxis in <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 patients is confirmed and the clinical importance of this fact is emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5) The data on the 14 patients support the opinion that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, in general, is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 is a marker of a specific pathogenetic pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which implies the beginning of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in a pluripotent stem cell </plain></SENT>
