<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow metaphases revealed both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> female karyotype and a single clonal abnormality, 46,XX,del(5)(q22q35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in ET, their incidence is very low, and no specific abnormality has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of the reported cases of ET with chromosomal aberrations, including 5q-, do not meet the diagnostic criteria proposed by the PVSG, and may represent one of the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patient appears to be the first example of untreated ET clearly meeting the PVSG criteria in which 5q- was the only clonal abnormality seen at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
