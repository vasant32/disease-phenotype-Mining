<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical outcomes of 295 lenalidomide-treated patients from two clinical trials (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-003 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-004) and 125 untreated red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with del(5q) Low- or Intermediate-1 (Int-1)-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from a large multicenter registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) progression and mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with left truncation to adjust for study entry differences between cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were well balanced across cohorts, except for a higher RBC transfusion burden in lenalidomide-treated patients (median, 6 vs 2 units/8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 4.3 years from first dose for lenalidomide-treated patients and 4.6 years from diagnosis for untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-year cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression incidences were 6.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3-13.9) and 12.1% (95% CI: 7.0-20.3) and 2-year overall survival (OS) probabilities were 89.9% (95% CI: 84.1-96.0) and 74.4% (95% CI: 66.1-83.7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression risk was similar in both cohorts (hazard ratio (HR) 0.969, P=0.930); however, lenalidomide treatment was associated with significant improvement in survival (HR 0.597, P=0.012), after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, lenalidomide treatment does not increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression risk, but instead confers a possible survival benefit in RBC transfusion-dependent patients with del(5q) Low- or Int-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
