<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the presence of an empty bone marrow, clinical distinction from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> seen in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> raises questions about etiologic and pathophysiologic relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to compare the degree of the hematopoietic failure in these diseases at the level of the most immature progenitor and stem cells that can be measured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a systemic, prospective fashion, we have studied bone marrow (n = 45) and peripheral blood (n = 33) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for the number of long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) in comparison to 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with new, untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (46 marrow; 62 blood samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the low numbers of cells available for the analysis, formal limiting dilution analysis could not be performed, instead secondary colony-forming cells (CFC) after 5 weeks of LTBMC were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the number of these cells is proportional to the input number of LTC-IC, the number of secondary CFC per 10(6) mononuclear cells (MNC) initiating the LTBMC can be used as a measure of the content of immature stem cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group consisted of 34 RA, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients with mean absolute neutrophil values of 1992, 1413, 1441, and 380 per mm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established based on bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and results of cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison to controls (147 +/- 38/10(6) MNC), significantly decreased numbers of bone marrow secondary CFC were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: in patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, 21 +/- 7 secondary CFC per 10(6) bone marrow MNC (P &lt; 0.001); patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>: 39 +/- 12 CFC per 10(6) marrow MNC (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups tested, the decrease in peripheral blood secondary CFC numbers was consistently less pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e>, secondary CFC were lower but not significantly different in comparison to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with hypercellular marrow (18 +/- 6 vs 35 +/- 11; NS; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> also was not associated with significantly lower neutrophil counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in 24% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, bone marrow secondary CFC were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, while in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> group only one of the patients showed secondary CFC number within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and blood secondary CFC numbers in hypoplastic RA were significantly higher than those in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> 919 +/- 5 in bone marrow, P &lt; 0.01; 7 +/- 2 in blood, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This trend was even more pronounced in hypoplastic RA with chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences were found between the secondary CFC numbers in hypoplastic RA and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We concluded that, although the deficiency in the stem cell compartment is less severe in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of early hematopoietic cells is an essential part of the pathophysiology in both diseases </plain></SENT>
