<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of tools for the prediction of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) would offer a major guidance in the therapeutic decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) has been associated with increased NRM risk in several retrospective studies, but its clinical utility has never been demonstrated prospectively in an adequately sized cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we prospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 1937 patients receiving HSCT in Italy over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HCT-CI was strongly correlated with both 2-year NRM (14.7%, 21.3%, and 27.3% in patients having an HCT-CI score of 0, 1-2, and ≥ 3, respectively) and overall survival (56.4%, 54.5%, and 41.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an excellent calibration between the predicted and observed 2-year NRM in patients having an HCT-CI score of 0 and 1-2, whereas in the ≥ 3 group the predicted NRM overestimated the observed NRM (41% vs 27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HCT-CI alone was the strongest predictor of NRM in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in first remission (c-statistics 0.66, 064, and 0.59, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We confirm the clinical utility of the HCT-CI score that could also identify patients at low NRM risk possibly benefiting from an HSCT-based treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
