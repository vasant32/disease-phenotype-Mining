<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some data indicate that leukapheresis products may also contain non-hematopoietic stem cells, as they occur in whole bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is still controversy whether MSC expand in the host after transplantation like blood progenitor cells do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were interested in finding out if graft MSC can be detected in leukapheresis products and in bone marrow after BMT and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every sample from total bone marrow transplants exhibited growth of MSC after in vitro culture, but not one of nine leukapheresis products did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, bone marrow aspirates of 9 patients receiving BMT and of 18 patients after PBSCT were examined for origin of MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MSC samples exhibited a complete host profile, whereas peripheral blood cells were of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that even if trace amounts of MSC are co-transplanted during PBSCT or BMT, they do not expand significantly in the host bone marrow </plain></SENT>
