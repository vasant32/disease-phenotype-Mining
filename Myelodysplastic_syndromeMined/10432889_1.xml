<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_404'>Soft tissue tumors</z:mpath> are rare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and the role of fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) cytology in their diagnosis has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASES: Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) developed soft tissue swellings during the course of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a third patient, soft tissue swelling was a presenting feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The swellings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152276" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">extramedullary myeloid cell tumor</z:e> (EMT) on FNA and showed increased blasts (10-14%), dyspoietic changes, Auer rods and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_404'>Soft tissue tumors</z:mpath> appearing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are likely to be EMTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FNA is therefore particularly valuable in their diagnosis as <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic cells are best studied on aspirated material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that FNA be preferred over excisional biopsy for the diagnosis of soft tissue swellings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
