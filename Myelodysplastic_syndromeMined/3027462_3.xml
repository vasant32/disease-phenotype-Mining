<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of eight patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) treated with Roacutane (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi>, Roche, Basel, (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-RA</z:chebi>)) 20 mg/m2 for 6 weeks and an additional 100 mg/m2 for 4 weeks (3 patients), 4 responded either with a slight increase in peripheral blood neutrophil count or a decrease in myeloperoxidase deficient neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In agar cultures 2 patients showed a concurrent increase in growth of day 11 colonies and clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 of the patients a decrease in the number of immature bone marrow cells positive for the myeloid antibody anti-My7 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only minor alterations were seen in natural killer cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients showing clonal chromosomal abnormalities before treatment a disappearance of minor clonal abnormalities during treatment was observed, and in 3 chromosomal abnormalities reappeared after cessation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even though the overall impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-RA</z:chebi> on the hematopoietic system was minor, the increase in myeloperoxidase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocytes in the blood and the decrease in My7 positive cells and in clonal chromosomal abnormalities warrants further interest in this agent as a treatment modality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side effects, especially experienced by the patients receiving 100 mg/m2, were, in spite of symptomatic treatment, of such a degree that only low dose treatment (10-20 mg/m2) administered for prolonged periods of time (3-6 months) would seem recommendable </plain></SENT>
