<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations of ras genes are associated with certain types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, indicating that they are related in some way to the malignant process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined bone marrow cells from nine children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 35 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) for activating point mutations of ras genes by in vitro amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), oligonucleotide hybridization and sequencing of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found N-ras mutations in cells from 3 of 9 children (33%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and only 2 of 35 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (6%; 95% confidence interval is 0.7-19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutations the second nucleotide of codon 12 or the first nucleotide of codon 61 of N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent correlation with clinical or laboratory characteristics, including karyotype; however, an association of N-ras activation with the most aggressive type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 2 of 6 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 had N-ras mutations; however, three children with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 which presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> lacked ras mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was studied at time of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and again after progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the preleukemic stage of disease, an N-ras mutation was identified; however, after development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> this mutation was not present in the leukemic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data show that ras mutations, while not necessary for leukemic transformation, may be important for the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemias</z:e> evolving into overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
