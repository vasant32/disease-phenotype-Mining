<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FLT3 receptor gene have been reported in 30% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether abnormal phosphorylation of FLT3 may be more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated FLT3 protein and its phosphorylation in the plasma from 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the level of plasma FLT3 protein level in the different diseases (p=0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients had a significantly higher level of phospho-FLT3:FLT3 ratio (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLT3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations were present in 27 (32%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated FLT3 was significantly higher in the plasma from patients with FLT3 mutation (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was no correlation between survival and the plasma level of FLT3 protein or its phosphorylated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, amongst the patients without FLT3 mutations, those with a higher level of phosphorylated FLT3 had a significantly shorter duration of remission (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms may be responsible for abnormal phosphorylation of FLT3 and inhibitors of FLT3 should also be investigated in patients without mutations </plain></SENT>
