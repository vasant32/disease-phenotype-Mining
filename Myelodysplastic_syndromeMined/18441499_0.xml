<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abdominal CT images resulted in a diagnosis of renal subcapsular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> thus conservative treatment, including blood transfusions of platelet, was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> enlarged, and she also had a spiking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was punctured and we drained an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> caused by Klebsiella Pneumoniae, the hematomal legion subsided, and the inflammatory symptoms improved </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the cause of the renal subcapsular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> has not yet been identified, the vulnerability due to aging of the small vessels along with a decrease in the number of platelets have been considered as contributing factors in this elderly case </plain></SENT>
