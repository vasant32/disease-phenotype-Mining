<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies investigating the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase Tl (GSTT1) null genotype and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reported controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the effect of GSTT1 null genotype on risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association was measured by odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen studies were finally included, involving a total of 1,796 cases and 2,502 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis was performed by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 studies showed that the GSTT1 null genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (OR = 1.47, 95 % CI 1.16-1.88, P OR = 0.002; I (2) = 54.4 %) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis by race suggested that this association existed in both Caucasians (OR = 1.40, 95 % CI 1.04-1.89, P OR = 0.027) and Asians (OR = 1.68, 95 % CI 1.00-2.81, P OR = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis suggests the GSTT1 null genotype is significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in both Caucasians and Asians </plain></SENT>
