<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many recurrent deletions, however, such biallelic inactivation has not been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One prominent example is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, a subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> characterized by a defect in erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated interference (RNAi)-based approach to discovery of the 5q- disease gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that partial loss of function of the ribosomal subunit protein RPS14 phenocopies the disease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoietic progenitor cells, and also that forced expression of RPS14 rescues the disease phenotype in patient-derived bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified a block in the processing of pre-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> in RPS14-deficient cells that is functionally equivalent to the defect in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, linking the molecular pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> to a congenital syndrome causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> is caused by a defect in ribosomal protein function and suggest that RNAi screening is an effective strategy for identifying causal haploinsufficiency disease genes </plain></SENT>
