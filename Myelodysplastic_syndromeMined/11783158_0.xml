<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Fuzheng Quxie Tablet (FZQXT) in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with FZQXT, changes of peripheral blood cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of bone marrow smear, bone marrow pathology and immunology were monitored before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of FZQXT on hematopoietic stem cells of mice were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The remission rate and total effective rate were 24.24% and 72.72% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FZQXT had obvious effect in promoting the proliferation of colony forming unit-erythrocytes (CFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of FZQXT in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> might be reached through promoting the proliferation of erythrocytic hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
