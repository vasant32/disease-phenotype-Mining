<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the relevance of p53 mutations in haematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, we performed polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis on the p53 gene in 45 patients with various types of haematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In exons 5-8 containing highly conserved regions, mobility shifts indicating sequence alterations were detected in four of the 45 patients, and subsequent sequencing was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A point mutation resulting in a novel stop codon was detected at codon 213 in one of 23 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (one of five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Point mutations causing amino acid substitutions were detected in one of four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> at codon 195, one of three cases of adult T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at codon 281, and one of eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at codon 281, and these missense mutations were accompanied by loss of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients harbouring these nonsense and missense mutations were in advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that mutational inactivation of the p53 gene is infrequent but is involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of several types of haematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> at least in some cases </plain></SENT>
