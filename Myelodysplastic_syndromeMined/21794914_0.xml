<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For more than 20 years erythropoietin (rHEPO) has largely been used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early clinical trials showed erythroid responses in no more than 15-25% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, a better selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients suitable for a therapeutic challenge with rHEPO, alone or in combination with G-CSF, allowed for an increased response-rate, averaging around 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, an even higher percentage of responses have been obtained using higher-doses of rHEPO (up to 80,000 IU/weekly) in lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This treatment however, especially at such high doses, is costly and not easily affordable for prolonged periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to verify if the use of "standard" doses of rHEPO could induce a satisfying response-rate with a less expensive treatment schedule in IPSS-defined "lower-risk" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> anemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From January 2005 to December 2009 a total of 55 consecutive anemic (Hb â‰¤ 10 g/dL) patients (29 males, 26 females, median age 78 years) with low-intermediate-1 risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated after informed consent with rHEPO (40,000 IU once a week subcutaneously) for at least 3 months; at the end of this period, erythroid response was assessed, and responders were allowed to continue the treatment indefinitely, whereas non-responders were considered "off study" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both efficacy and safety of the treatment were recorded and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of treatment, 36 out of 55 (65.5%) patients achieved an erythroid response to rHEPO according to IWG 2006 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher response-rates to rHEPO were related with both lower IPSS and particularly WPSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment was safe, and only 1 patient had to discontinue the treatment because of unmanageable side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 36 responders, 28 (77%) maintained the response after a median follow-up of 46 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that standard doses of rHEPO are at least as effective as higher-doses for correcting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; in this clinical scenario, this schedule allows for a consistent reduction of costs without precluding the achievement of a durable erythroid response </plain></SENT>
