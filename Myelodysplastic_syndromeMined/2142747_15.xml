<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction and hybridization of oligonucleotide probes to the amplified sequences, we have detected mutations in eight of 41 patients, at codons 301 and 969 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro work has highlighted mutations at these codons as being oncogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report the detection of potentially activating mutations of the human FMS gene in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequence of these mutations in the multistep pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> and their relevance to prognosis remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
