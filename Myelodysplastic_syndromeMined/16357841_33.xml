<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed a pilot study to target DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylation through the sequential administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> phenylbutyrate (PB) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten evaluable patients (eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with seven consecutive daily subcutaneous injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> at 75 mg/m2 followed by 5 days of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> PB given intravenously at a dose of 200 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients (50%) were able to achieve a beneficial clinical response (partial remission or stable disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is alive without evidence of disease 39 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination regimen was well tolerated with common toxicities of injection site skin reaction (90% of the patients) from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> from the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> PB infusion (80% of the patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlative laboratory studies demonstrated the consistent reacetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4, although no relationship with the clinical response could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from this pilot study demonstrate that a combination approach targeting different mechanisms of transcriptional modulation is clinically feasible with acceptable toxicity and measurable biologic and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
