<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been established as an informative technique in genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, differences in the ratio of hybridization intensities were reported for particular chromosomes, which may affect CGH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define these differences in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, CGH results of 70 samples of bone marrow cells (BMC) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in conventional cytogenetics (CC) were evaluated using seven different reference DNAs and two different DNA labeling systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: CGH using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi>-conjugated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> for DNA labeling indicated signal deviations in 21/70 BMC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deviations affected chromosomes 1 (n = 21), 2 (n = 11), 4 (n = 11), 5 (n = 9), 6 (n = 7), 7 (n = 2), 8 (n = 2), 12 (n = 5), 13 (n = 15), 14 (n = 1), 16 (n = 17), 17 (n = 11), 19 (n = 21), 20 (n = 12), and/or 22 (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the imbalances were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-conjugated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in exemplary cases (n = 5) led to the disappearance of the signal deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated CGH experiments using seven different reference DNAs showed remarkable variations in the signal deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hybridization differences depend not only on the hapten or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> used for DNA labeling, but also on the reference DNA chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, close control of CGH experiments is mandatory, and additional techniques such as FISH should be performed to confirm the results obtained by CGH </plain></SENT>
