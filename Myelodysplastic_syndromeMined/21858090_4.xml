<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The DNA methylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (DAC) is approved for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), but resistance to DAC develops during treatment and mechanisms of resistance remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to DAC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed Quantitative Real-Time PCR to examine expression of genes related to DAC metabolism prior to therapy in 32 responders and non-responders with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as 14 patients who achieved a complete remission and subsequently relapsed while on therapy (secondary resistance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then performed quantitative methylation analyses by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing of 10 genes as well as Methylated CpG Island Amplification Microarray (MCAM) analysis of global methylation in secondary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most genes showed no differences by response, but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>/DCK ratio was 3 fold higher in non-responders than responders (P&lt;.05), suggesting that this could be a mechanism of primary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences at relapse in DAC metabolism genes, and no DCK mutations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global methylation measured by the LINE1 assay was lower at relapse than at diagnosis (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On average, the methylation of 10 genes was lower at relapse (16.1%) compared to diagnosis (18.1%) (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAM analysis showed decreased methylation of an average of 4.5% (range 0.6%-9.7%) of the genes at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, new cytogenetic changes were found in 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pharmacological mechanisms are involved in primary resistance to DAC, whereas hypomethylation does not prevent a relapse for patients with DAC treatment </plain></SENT>
