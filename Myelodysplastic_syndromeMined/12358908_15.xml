<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), measuring clonality and T-cell receptor Vbeta (TCRBV) expression of CD4 and CD8 T cells by polymerase chain reaction and by flow cytometric analysis of TCRBV families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD4 and CD8 T-cell repertoire in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is characterized by an abnormal TCRBV-restricted expansion of T cells in CD4 and CD8 cells, and increased expression of the CD8 effector marker CD57 of multiple TCRBV in CD8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonality analysis of CD4 and CD8 cells showed that seven of 10 patients analysed had a major clone in the CD8 cells but not in CD4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in one patient we found that both the CD57- and CD57+ fraction contained the clone (which was absent from the TCRBV-negative fraction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, multiple T-cell expansions can be found in both helper and cytotoxic T cells, and that, in the CD8 cells, T cells functionally differentiate in vivo from memory to effector T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, these data support the hypothesis of the involvement of T cells in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
