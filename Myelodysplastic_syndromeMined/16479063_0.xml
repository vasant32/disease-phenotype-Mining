<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of pentoxifylline (P) and ciprofloxacin (C) has been shown to reduce the serum levels of TNF-alpha, and an earlier trial of P and C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (D) provided good palliation for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to assess the hematologic response to PCD therapy for patients suffering with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>21 of 25 patients who completed at least of 12 weeks of treatment were evaluable for the treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the patient's median age was 60 yr (range: 18-75 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses according to WHO classification included: RA (n=5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (n=10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>/RS (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>11 patients (52%) had at least single lineage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 patients (11%) showed improvement of triple lineage cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the response rates between the FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 4 weeks (range: 2-12 weeks), and it is interesting that 9 of 11 patients who had a response remained without relapse for a median of 177 days (range: 78-634 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results indicate that anti-cytokine therapy with PCD is an effective and well tolerated palliative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
