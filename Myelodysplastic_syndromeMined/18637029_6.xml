<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 149 patients de novo diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> between December 1994 and February 2007, were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WPSS presented an excellent method for risk-stratifying patients into five subgroups, with different risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and leukaemic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, three components of WPSS - cytogenetic risk, WHO category and transfusion dependency - had good correlations with overall survival (OS) and time to leukaemic evolution (TTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, one component of IPSS - number of peripheral cytopenias - did not correlate with OS or TTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WPSS could distinguish the truly low-risk patients (very low) who had an excellent long-term survival with rare leukaemic evolution, while IPSS could not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients should be managed with clinical observation and delayed treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, on multivariate analysis for OS, WPSS was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival along with age [P = 0.04; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.85] and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.002; HR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.41-4.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the prognostic significance of IPSS was not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the WPSS might be a more powerful predictor of prognosis than IPSS and that independent validation of several other, larger data sets should be necessary </plain></SENT>
