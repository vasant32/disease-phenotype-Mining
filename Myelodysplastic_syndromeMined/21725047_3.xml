<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because of the ubiquitous expression of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-deficient patients often present also with nonimmunologic clinical problems, affecting the skeletal, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, and gastrointestinal systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report that myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> features and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> are often found in patients with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a clinical correlate to this finding, we have observed vulnerability to antibiotic-induced myelotoxicity and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> after nonmyeloablative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also noted that, in the absence of enzyme replacement therapy, absolute neutrophil counts of patients with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> deficiency vary inversely with the accumulation of deoxynucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data have significant implications for the application of standard and investigational therapies to patients with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> and support further studies to investigate the possibility that <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> deficiency is associated with a stem cell defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00018018 and #NCT00006319 </plain></SENT>
