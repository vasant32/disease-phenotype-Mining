<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we described a group of patients with hemocytopenia who did not conform to diagnostic criteria of known hematological and nonhematological diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients responded well to adrenocortical hormone and/or high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, indicating that cytopenia might be mediated by autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies were detected on the membrane of various bone marrow (BM) hemopoietic cells by bone marrow mononuclear-cell-Coombs test or flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the hemocytopenia was termed "Immunorelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo>" (IRP) to distinguish it from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantigens in IRP were investigated by membrane protein extraction from BM hemopoietic cells and BM supernatant from IRP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody IgG was detected in the BM supernatant of 75% of patients (15/20), which was significantly higher than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> patients (0%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls (0%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoantigens had approximate molecular weights of 25, 30, 47.5, 60, 65, 70, and 80â€‰kDa, some of which were further identified by mass fingerprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study identified that a G-protein-coupled receptor 156 variant and chain P, a crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of human erythrocyte band-3 protein, were autoantigens in IRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the antigenicity of these autoantigens </plain></SENT>
