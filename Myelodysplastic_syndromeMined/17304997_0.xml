<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore some operative problems of correcting paralytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (PS) by using vertebral pedicle screws-rods system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2000 to May 2005, 18 patients with PS were corrected by screws-rods system which were made of <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> alloy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 10 males and 8 females, aging from 11 to 26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poliomyelitis</z:e> in 13 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (MS) in 5 patients (2 cases for second correction) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of an average 85 degrees Cobb angle (55-125 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pelvic obliquity was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an average 24 degrees angle (3-55 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients,3 cases were given perioperative halo-pelvic traction, 2 cases were given vertebral wedge osteotomy and correction and fixation, the other patients were purely underwent the treatment of pedicle screw-rods system implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fusion segment at operation ranged from 6 to 15 sections, applied screws the most was 16, the fewest was 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and neurologic complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> wounds healed by the first intention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> obtained obvious correction (P&lt;0.001), the correction rate averaged 52.95% (44%-81%); the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008454'>lumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> and pelvic obliquity were apparently corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average clinical follow-up (16 cases) was 21 months (6-36 months), there was no implants failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with MS had a worse Cobb magnitude, the other patients had no curve progression (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of vertebral pedicle screwsrods fixation to multiple vertebral bodys and short segment fusion for PS, the treatment method is reliable and the outcome is satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While performing the correcting operative procedures, the spinal, pelvic and lower extremity deformities and functions should be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> considered as a whole </plain></SENT>
