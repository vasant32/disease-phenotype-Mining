<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to investigate the toxicity and efficacy of a novel preparative regimen of Bu 14 mg/kg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 50-60 mg/kg, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 120 mg/kg in patients with primary refractory and relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-seven patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 14-67 years) underwent transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen was well tolerated, with 5.5% treatment-related mortality at 100 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow up of 6.7 years, the 5-year progression-free survival was 48 +/- 5%, and the 5-year overall survival was 51 +/- 5% </plain></SENT>
