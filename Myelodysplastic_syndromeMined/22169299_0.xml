<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were divided into low-risk group and high-risk group according to IPSS score system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 levels, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells and microvessel density (MVD) of BM were detected by ELISA, flow cytometry and immunochemistry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the SDF-1 level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls(p &lt; 0.05), and SDF-1 level in low-risk group was significantly higher than that in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells significantly increased in low-risk group compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MVD in BM biopsy significantly increased in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (p &lt; 0.05), compared with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group which also had higher MVD than the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive correlation was found between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells and SDF-1 levels in low-risk group, and SDF-1 level and MVD in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of SDF-1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of BM CD34(+) cells and MVD were significantly abnormal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, especially in different risk group, suggesting that SDF-1 level is related to cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
