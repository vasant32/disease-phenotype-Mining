<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-level CMV antigenemia (10 or more positive cells on two slides) or CMV antigenemia at any level in patients with grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) were chosen as risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also retrospectively evaluated virus reactivation in plasma using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 27 patients with or without grade I aGVHD developed high-level CMV antigenemia or CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 patients with grade II-IV aGVHD, 12 patients (52%) developed CMV antigenemia and were treated pre-emptively, of whom two developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV gastroenteritis</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> in spite of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of the remaining 11 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV gastroenteritis</z:e> before CMV antigenemia was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the eight patients with CMV diseases were successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly related to CMV disease occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four of the seven evaluable patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV gastroenteritis</z:e>, real-time PCR was able to detect virus reactivation earlier than CMV antigenemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although our risk-adapted pre-emptive therapy effectively reduced CMV-related mortality, further refinements of this approach, particularly in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV gastroenteritis</z:e>, may be achieved by incorporating real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
