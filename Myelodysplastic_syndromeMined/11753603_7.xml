<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, approximately half of myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients presents a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is more sensitive than CCA allowing for the detection of minor clones and of submicroscopic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed by FISH 101 MDS patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype for the occurrence of the abnormalities which are most frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (ie -5/5q-, -7/7q-, +8, 17p-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients, 15 to 32% of interphase cells were found to carry one FISH abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients presented <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, five had del(5)(q31), five del(7)(q31), one <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and one del(17)(p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH abnormalities were more frequently observed among patients with an increased percentage of bone marrow blasts (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH abnormalities were also associated with a higher rate of progression into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (13/18 vs 12/83, P &lt; 0.001) and were predictive for a worse prognosis (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that FISH positivity and IPSS risk group were independent predictors for a poor survival (P = 0.0057 and 0.0123, respectively) and for leukemic transformation (P = 0.0006 and 0.035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukemic transformation in FISH-positive patients was associated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with an expansion of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that a significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype presented, if analyzed by FISH, clones of cytogenetically abnormal cells which played a determinant role in the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of FISH abnormalities identified a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype characterized by an inferior prognosis </plain></SENT>
