<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> was found in eight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in two and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 bone marrow biopsies were obtained from seven individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow evaluation revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with marked trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since an excess of myeloblasts or an increase of CD34 positive progenitor cells was not seen, the disorders were designated as 'refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>' or with regard to the dysplastic megakaryopoiesis '<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, unclassifiable' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients died after 10 and 55 months of follow-up due to infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a further patient, bone marrow analysis repeatedly showed an unexplained granulopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, which, however, was not dysplastic enough to allow a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients had clearly reactive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the notion that RP is a heterogenous disorder and suggest that RP may at times represent a paraneoplastic phenomenon of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since HLA typing revealed a significantly increased frequency of the antigen DR4 (10/17 patients positive = 59%), we hypothesize that immunological imbalances due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in conjunction with a specific immunogenetic background may play key roles in the pathogenesis of RP in these patients </plain></SENT>
