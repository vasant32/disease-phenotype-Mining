<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found LA in 51/206 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation with age, disease progression or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group with LA had lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values (P=0.03), and was associated with an increase in reticulin fibres (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although they were more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most LA had a benign <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and showed CD20 expression in three distinct patterns: central, perinodular or diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence of an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA probably represent an ongoing immune stimulation and are probably related to an altered bone marrow microenvironment, with no impact on prognosis </plain></SENT>
