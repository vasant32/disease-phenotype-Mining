<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on analysis of deletions of chromosome 7 in such patients, it has been suggested that there is a critical region of the chromosome lying within bands q21-q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukaemia</z:hpo> who had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for or rearrangement of chromosome 7, seeking evidence of non-random allele loss that might suggest the presence of imprinted genes on the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells from one patient with the infant <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 syndrome had loss of maternal alleles as did two patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_503'>biphenotypic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five out of five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and both patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had loss of paternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the latter patients had a del(7) (q31q36) rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that imprinting of a gene(s) on chromosome 7, within the bands q31-q36, may be of importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
