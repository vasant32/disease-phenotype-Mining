<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 35-year-old woman with a single hypopigmented patch on the right leg present since birth, had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor, for treatment of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beginning on day +38 post-BMT, the patch developed changes which were histologically consistent with GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Syngeneic mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (MECLR) testing of tissue from the patch, and from adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin, showed differences which suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0007544'>piebaldism</z:hpo>-affected skin is immunologically different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings may offer new insight into the pathophysiology of this disorder </plain></SENT>
