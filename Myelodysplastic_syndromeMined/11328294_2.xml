<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 and 7q deletions are the most frequent abnormalities, although translocations and inversions involving 7q also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region 7q22--q34 may contain as many as four distinct minimal regions of deletion (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDRs</z:chebi>), which are thought to contain one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid tumour</z:e>-suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have defined previously the proximal breakpoint of a constitutional 7q22--q34 inversion, carried in a cell line derived from a member of a family with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A YAC clone spanning this breakpoint was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both inversion breakpoints have now been cloned and sequenced, placing the proximal breakpoint 40 kb centromeric to the TAC2 (tachykinin 2) gene and the distal breakpoint 42 kb telomeric to the SSBP (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi>-binding protein) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence alignments revealed small (3--4 bp) duplications at the inversion breakpoints, suggesting that the mechanism of inversion involved the creation of staggered breaks and filling in of the overhanging ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 190-bp Alu--Alu deletion close to the distal breakpoint was also detected and may have contributed to the inversion </plain></SENT>
