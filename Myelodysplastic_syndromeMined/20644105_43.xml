<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, data on a comprehensive cytogenetic or molecular genetic characterization are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Here, we analyzed 81 thoroughly characterized patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> type 1, n = 45; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> type 2, n = 36) by applying next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to investigate CBL, JAK2, MPL, NRAS, and KRAS at known mutational hotspot regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, complete coding regions were analyzed for RUNX1 (beta isoform) and TET2 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cytogenetic aberrations were found in 18.2% of patients (14 of 77 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, at least one molecular mutation was observed in 72.8% of patients (59 of 81 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean of 1.6 mutations per patient was observed by this unprecedented screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 105 variances were detected by this comprehensive molecular screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After excluding known polymorphisms or silent mutations, 82 distinct mutations remained (CBL, n = 15; JAK2V617F, n = 8; MPL, n = 0; NRAS, n = 10; KRAS, n = 12; RUNX1, n = 7; and TET2, n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to clinical data, a better outcome was seen for patients carrying TET2 mutations (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of molecular markers used to categorize myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is constantly increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Here, NGS screening has been demonstrated to support a comprehensive characterization of the molecular background in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A pattern of molecular mutations translates into different biologic and prognostic categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
