<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Current prognostic models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) do not consider the prognostic value of a bone marrow blast level that is &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exploring the prognostic value of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and a marrow blast level that is &lt;5% may lead to better risk-adapted therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the World Health Organization classification, most of our patients (65.5%) fell into the new category 'refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>' (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prognostic value of the IPSS in 435 adult patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in the 285 of them that had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the prognostic value of bone marrow blast levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and in different IPSS risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a significant difference in survival times between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients with a marrow blast level of 3.5% or higher vs. those with a blast level of &lt;3.5%, with median survival times of 23.7 and 40.8 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, application of a marrow blast level cutoff of 3.5% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> could identify patients with a lower IPSS risk but with a potentially worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed marrow blast level (using 3.5% as the cutoff) to be an independent factor that impacted survival times of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also found that IPSS had strong prognostic value in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, a higher percentage of marrow blasts was associated with a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
