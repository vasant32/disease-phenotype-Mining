<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small clinical trials of 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) have shown modest efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> prevented the administration of doses that have been shown to be effective in vitro </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> analog is unique because it has little hypercalcemic potential; but in vitro, it has strong anti-leukemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted a clinical trial of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7931">paricalcitol</z:chebi> to 12 MDS patients whose disease varied between an IPSS of low to high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drug was well-tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No responses were observed according to international working group (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the platelet count of 1 of the 12 individuals rose from 53,500 to 120,000/microl blood over 5 weeks; but the patient succumbed to a fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
