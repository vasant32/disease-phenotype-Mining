<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study of 309 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at two transplantation centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine the effect of pretransplantation hyperferritinemia on survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both univariate and multivariate analysis, elevated ferritin levels were significantly associated with shorter overall and relapse-free survival times and increased relapse rate, but lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated ferritin levels were not associated with non-relapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that ferritin may exert an immunosuppressive effect, reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> and graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effects, resulting in increased risk of relapse and impaired survival </plain></SENT>
