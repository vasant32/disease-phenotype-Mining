<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in mice and humans have emphasized an important contribution of host-reactive minor histocompatibility antigen (mH)-specific lymphokine-secreting donor T-helper cells (Th) for the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using limiting dilution (LD) and clonal specificity analyses, we investigated in 14 patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD after non-T-depleted HLA-identical sibling BMT whether posttransplant host-reactive mH-specific interleukin-2 (IL-2)-secreting Th are involved in the development of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and the establishment of tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At different time intervals posttransplant (I, days 0 through 45; II, days 45 through 90; III, days 90 through 180), host-specific IL-2-secreting Th-precursors (Th-p) were quantitatively assessed in six patients during clinically apparent grade II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of responding Th-p ranged from 1/13,000 to 1 4,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of host-specific Th-p was significantly correlated with the development of grade II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (P = .0003 by Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detectability of host-specific Th-p preceded the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of grade II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Host-specific Th-p were no longer detectable after the clinical resolution of grade II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, prolonged occurrence of host-specific Th-p was accompanied by clinically persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (grade 0) (n = 7) and grade I (n = 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, host-specific Th-p were not detectable at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that host-reactive Th are critically involved in the development and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and may contribute to the establishment of tolerance after genotypically HLA-identical sibling BMT </plain></SENT>
