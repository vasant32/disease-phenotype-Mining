<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether TD also affects outcome after allogeneic transplantation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in 172 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (median age, 51 years), we analyzed the impact of TD on outcome after high-dose conditioning and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 37 months, the probability of 3-year overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between patients who were TD and those who were not TD before PBSCT (P=.1); however, transfusion burden, as reflected by ferritin levels, was correlated with a greater probability of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD; P=.03) and a higher comorbidity index (P=.01), and OS was inferior in those patients with a ferritin level&gt;1000 microg/L before PBSCT (P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only marrow myeloblast count (P=.01) and comorbidity index (P=.001) had a significant impact on OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data do not identify TD as an independent negative prognostic factor for outcome after allogeneic PBSCT' however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (presumably transfusion-related) may contribute to poor transplantation success by adding to the overall comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether clinical intervention in the form of iron chelation can improve the outcome of allogeneic PBSCT in TD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
