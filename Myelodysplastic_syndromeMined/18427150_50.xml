<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lenalidomide is a novel therapeutic agent with uncertain mechanism of action that is clinically active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of high (MM) and low (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) doses of lenalidomide has been reported to have clinical activity in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we highlight life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e> when higher doses of lenalidomide are administered to patients with CLL and provide a potential mechanism for its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854802" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed CLL</z:e> were treated with lenalidomide (25 mg/d for 21 days of a 28-day cycle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies examining drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and activation of CLL cells were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four consecutive patients were treated with lenalidomide; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Tumor flare</z:e> was observed in three patients and was characterized by dramatic and painful lymph node enlargement resulting in hospitalization of two patients, with one fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated lenalidomide-induced B-cell activation (upregulation of CD40 and CD86) corresponding to degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e>, possibly explaining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e> observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide administered at 25 mg/d in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854802" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed CLL</z:e> is associated with unacceptable toxicity; the rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and adverse clinical effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853891" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor flare</z:e> represent a significant limitation of lenalidomide use in CLL at this dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drug-associated B-cell activation may contribute to this adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies with lenalidomide in CLL should focus on understanding this toxicity, investigating patients at risk, and investigating alternative safer dosing schedules </plain></SENT>
