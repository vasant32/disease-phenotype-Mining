<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is variable, and risk factors related to disease progression are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical and laboratory data of the patients who were diagnosed with non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from 1997 to 2007 at Seoul National University Hospital and analyzed the clinical course and outcomes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> with cytopenia in the peripheral blood, which does not meet the criteria for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (at least two of the following: ANC &lt; 500/microl, platelet &lt; 20,000/microl or reticulocyte &lt; 20,000/microl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 96 patients, 53 (55.2%) were male and the median age was 37.6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As much as 41.7% (40) of the patients were initially asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients who were treated with oxymetholone, ATG/ALG, cyclosporin or other agents after initial diagnosis showed significantly lower levels of initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, red blood cell count and platelet count than those who did not receive any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 18 patients progressed to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 29.9 years and the median progression time was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count in the evolution group tended to be lower than in the other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> did not respond to treatment showed markedly higher frequency of progression to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment itself and responsiveness in reticulocyte and absolute neutrophil count were not correlated with their clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients showed overall improvement, whereas three patients developed secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has a relatively indolent and mild clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, 18.8% of the study population progressed to severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>White blood cell and absolute neutrophil count at diagnosis and treatment responsiveness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Careful monitoring and early management are needed for patients at risk </plain></SENT>
