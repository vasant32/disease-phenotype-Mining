<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cell surface phenotype of immunoregulatory lymphocytes in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a stem cell disorder, was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells from 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and nine with RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) were characterized by two-color flow cytometry using various monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant change of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in PB, but a decrease of the percent of positive cells for CD8++ among the total lymphocyte (%CD8++) was noticed in RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in BM of RA patients, a decrease in the number of CD4+ cells, but not CD8++ cells, was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients, the absolute numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD8++ cells in BM were decreased; however, the ratio of these lymphocytes was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No change was observed among the CD4+ subsets in PB of RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BM, a decrease in percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ (%CD4+CD45RA+; naive cell) and increases in CD4+CD45RO+ (%CD4+CD45RO+; memory cell) and CD4+CD29+ (%CD4+CD29+; helper/inducer) among CD4+ cells were found in both RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the CD8++ subset showed an increased number of CD8++CD11a+ cells (activated CTL) in both BM and PB of RA patients, but not of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increments in CD56+ and CD16+ cells among CD3- cells (natural killer; NK cells) were seen in RA patients but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were involved in the abnormal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) clones, but our results regarding the increments of CD8++CD11a+ and NK cells in RA patients suggest that the mechanism of immune surveillance against the abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clones was activated in these RA patients, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is required to clarify the functions of these immunoregulatory lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
