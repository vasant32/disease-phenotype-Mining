<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical data of 69 consecutive patients diagnosed as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> over a period of 5 years were collected and stored by Epi Data 3.0, 63 patients out of which were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPSS 13.0 software was applied to deal with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The statistical methods included life table, Kaplan-Meier, Log-rank test and Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the median age of 63 patients was 38 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>26 out of 63 patients had karyotype aberration (41.27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 30.63 months, and 33 patients (52.38%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five prognostic scoring systems could successfully discriminate risk groups as regards overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IPSS, Lille and Spanish prognostic scoring system were more effective (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that IPSS (p&lt;0.0001) and Lille chromosome classifications (p&lt;0.0001) were most important factors for OS followed by bone marrow blasts (p=0.00062), Spanish prognostic scoring system (p=0.00064) and Lille prognostic system (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The WHO classifications also successfully discriminated between risk groups (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The new WHO subgroups [refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>), with or without ringed sideroblasts] showed a significantly different prognosis (p=0.003) for OS, in comparison to the subgroups having erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> only (RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reclassified to FAB classification, and the low risk group (RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and high risk group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) also had significant difference (p=0.00012) as regards OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the major independent prognostic variables for OS are percentage of bone marrow blasts and karyotype aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of WHO classification have more significance for improving predictive value than that of the FAB classification, and the IPSS can be used for clinical decision-making in patients with cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the hospitals which cannot carry out the cytogenetic examination, Spanish prognostic system can be applied to the patients without cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
