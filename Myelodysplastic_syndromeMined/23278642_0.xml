<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GSTP1 enzyme plays a key role in the biotransformation of a variety of carcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The corresponding gene is subject to a single nucleotide polymorphism (A(313)G) leading to abolished enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate whether the GSTP1 polymorphism influences <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> susceptibility, we conducted a case-control study comprising 310 de novo patients and 370 healthy controls using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GSTP1 gene status was also evaluated in relation to patients' characteristics and chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher incidence of the GSTP1 variant genotypes was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results revealed increased frequencies of heterozygotes in patients younger than 60 years old and of homozygotes G/G in older patients (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence for a pathogenetic role of the GSTP1 polymorphism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk, probably in an age-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
