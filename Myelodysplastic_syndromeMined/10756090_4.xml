<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous study localized the breakpoints of two acquired isodicentric X chromosomes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> to a 450-kb region proximal to the XIST gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the construction and extensive characterization of a reliable 1-Mb P1 artificial chromosome and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome contig covering a highly problematic region in Xq13 that includes the previously described isodicentric breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to mapping of the brain-specific gene (NAP1L2) and the phosphoglyceryl kinase alpha subunit 1 gene (PHKA1) and generation and mapping of a large number of STSs throughout the contig, we have mapped a putative transcriptional regulatory protein (HDACL1), and 35 ESTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing data, Southern blot analysis, and fiber-FISH analysis have permitted characterization of extensive region-specific duplications and triplications in addition to an unusually high concentration of long interspersed repeat elements, both of which could be implicated in isodicentric chromosome formation and other Xq13 chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes from two previously unpublished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and one preleukemic patient using cosmid clones and selected subclones allowed mapping of the idic(X)(q13) breakpoints to a 100-kb interval, consistent with the involvement of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> gene in the genesis of this form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>, disruption of which may represent a preliminary step in progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assembly and physical mapping of this complex 1-Mb contig establish a foundation for ongoing sequencing and gene identification projects in the region </plain></SENT>
