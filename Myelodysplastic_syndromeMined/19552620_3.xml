<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were identified between 05/01/2000 and 09/30/2003 from a longitudinal, retrospective claims database for a large, geographically diverse US health plan and their medical histories were followed for at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as transfusion-dependent (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TD) or transfusion-independent (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variables were categorized as demographic, health status, utilization, or cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilization (inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient facility visits, emergency department visits, and physician office visits) is reported as the mean and median numbers of each specified encounter per subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs were measured as the sum of patient and plan liability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variables were analyzed descriptively, and appropriate statistical tests were used to compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TI cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacy, medical, and total health care costs, adjusted for demographics and comorbidity, were estimated using gamma regression with a log link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TI cohort consisted of 2864 patients, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TD cohort comprised 336 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age for the entire study sample was 70.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TI cohort tended to receive most of its medical care at physicians' offices, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TD cohort received nearly as much medical care at outpatient facilities (e.g., infusion clinics, hospital outpatient clinics) as it did in physicians' offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-TD cohort had significantly higher mean annual costs: pharmacy, $4457 vs. $2926; medical, $50,663 vs. $17,469; total, $51,066 vs. $19,811 (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, transfusion dependence was associated with an incremental cost of $31,255 per patient per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Some limitations inherent to using claims data and diagnosis codes for research apply to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that an important consequence of transfusion dependence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was markedly greater use of, and consequently higher costs associated with, inpatient and outpatient services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Continued research and efforts to develop biologic and pharmaceutical therapies may help more patients achieve transfusion independence, thereby reducing the financial burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
