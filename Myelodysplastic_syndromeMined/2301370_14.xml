<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients, five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and one with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), were found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 by conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repetitive DNA sequences from the heterochromatic region of human chromosomes 1 and 7 were used as probes for in situ hybridization experiments on interphase cells of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A double hybridization protocol was used to reveal the particular chromosomes as distinct spots or clusters of signals within interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 1 sequence served as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous detection of the sequences showed the presence of two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number 1 chromosomes and a missing 7 chromosome from individual cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While cytogenetic preparations showed only -7 metaphases in 3 AML and 1 MDS patients, in situ hybridization of interphase cells showed many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells as well as the presence of -7 in fully mature granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient studied in remission showed only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases yet had 9% interphase cells with a missing 7 and relapsed within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that examination of interphase cells by in situ hybridization provides clinically useful data since every cell including mature granulocytes can be examined, the lineage of a cell can be determined, and efficacy of differentiation therapy can be evaluated </plain></SENT>
