<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective sequential evaluation of BMD in the lumbar spine and nondominant hip using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in a cohort of 47 adult patients (median age, 43 years) who were undergoing radiation-based BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline DEXA studies were performed before BMT and repeated at 3 to 4 months, 6 to 8 months, and 12 to 14 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (60%) had been minimally treated with combination cytotoxic chemotherapy, having received no more than 1 treatment regimen before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> in combination with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean lumbar spine and hip BMD were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> before BMT (spine: 1.01 g/cm2, z score = 96%; hip: 0.86 g/cm2, z score = 100%) and gradually decreased (spine: 0.98 g/cm2, z score = 94%; hip: 0.76 g/cm2, z score = 91%) at 12 to 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These declines were statistically significant (P &lt; .006 and &lt; .002 for lumbar spine; P &lt; .001 and &lt; .001 for hip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the sharpest decline occurred during the first 6 months after BMT and was more marked in the hip than the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that BMT adversely affects BMD in this patient population </plain></SENT>
