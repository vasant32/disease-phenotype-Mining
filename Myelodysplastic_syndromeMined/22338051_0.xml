<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 9 cases of APL at our institution in which there was a history of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppression, or antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that secondary and de novo APL had abnormal promyelocytes with similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features, comparable cytogenetic findings, comparable rates of FMS-like tyrosine kinase mutations, and similar rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that secondary APL is similar to de novo APL and, thus, should be considered distinct from other secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
