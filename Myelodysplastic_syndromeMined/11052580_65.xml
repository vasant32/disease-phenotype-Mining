<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy drug distribution varies greatly among individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed an individualised fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (FEC) regimen to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then did a randomised trial to compare this individually tailored FEC regimen with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 525 women younger than 60 years of age with high-risk primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were randomised after surgery to receive nine cycles of tailored FEC to haematological equitoxicity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (n=251), or three cycles of FEC at standard doses followed by high-dose chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, thiotepa, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> (CTCb), and peripheral-blood stem-cell or bone-marrow support (n=274) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups received locoregional radiation therapy and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was relapse-free survival, and analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 34.3 months, there were 81 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast-cancer</z:hpo> relapses in the tailored FEC group versus 113 in the CTCb group (double triangular method p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the tailored FEC group and 82 in the CTCb group (log-rank p=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the CTCb group experienced more grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity compared with the tailored FEC group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.7%) occurred in the CTCb group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients in the tailored FEC group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and three developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Tailored FEC with G-CSF support resulted in a significantly improved relapse-free survival and fewer grade 3 and 4 toxicities compared with marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy with CTCb as adjuvant therapy of women with high-risk primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
