<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lenalidomide is effective in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with deletion 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report results of a phase I dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and four adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide was given orally at escalating doses of 25 to 75 mg daily on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to provide pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 22 to 79 years) and a median of two prior therapies (range, one to four therapies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DLT was <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>; 50 mg/d was the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infectious complications were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally with dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, five (16%) of 31 patients achieved complete remission (CR); three of three patients with cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR (none with deletion 5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response duration ranged from 5.6 to 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses occurred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with low presenting WBC count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient with ALL responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two of four patients who received lenalidomide as initial therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> relapse after allogeneic transplantation achieved durable CR after development of cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, without donor leukocyte infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide was safely escalated to 50 mg daily for 21 days, every 4 weeks, and was active with relatively low toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Remissions achieved after transplantation suggest a possible immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide, and results provide enthusiasm for further studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, either alone or in combination with conventional agents or other immunotherapies </plain></SENT>
