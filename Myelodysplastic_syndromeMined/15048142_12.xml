<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 36 patients (median age 55 years) underwent RIST from an HLA-matched related donor between September 1999 and December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evolving from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=10), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts n=6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RIST regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog (cladribine or fludarabine)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, with or without antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regimen was well tolerated, and 34 patients achieved durable engraftment and most achieved remission after RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients developed grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, and 27 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients relapsed, and five of them received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of the preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 patients died (four disease progression, six transplantation-related complications, and two others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Estimated 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) in low- and high-risk groups was 85 and 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RIST can be performed safely in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, and has therapeutic potential for those who fail conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of the significant association between GVHD or ATG and DFS, defined management of GVHD following RIST should become a major target of clinical research </plain></SENT>
