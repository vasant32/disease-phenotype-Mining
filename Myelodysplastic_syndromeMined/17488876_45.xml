<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included high-dose total-body irradiation (TBI)/chemotherapy (n = 83); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (BU)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) (BUCY, n = 122; with BU targeting [tBUCY], n = 93); fludarabine (Flu) with tBU (FLUtBU; n = 12); Flu plus 200 cGy TBI (n = 26); and miscellaneous regimens (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-identical or partially mismatched family members in 135 and unrelated individuals in 122 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year relapse-free survival was highest (43%) and nonrelapse mortality lowest (28%) among tBUCY-conditioned patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared with results in 339 patients who received transplants for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/tAML, and a multivariate analysis failed to show significant differences in outcome between the 2 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relapse probability and relapse-free survival correlated significantly with disease stage (P &lt; .001) and karyotype (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse incidence was lower (P = .003) and relapse-free survival superior (P = .02) with unrelated donor transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that overall inferior outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/tAML was related to the frequency of high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both cohorts, transplantation outcomes improved over the time interval studied </plain></SENT>
