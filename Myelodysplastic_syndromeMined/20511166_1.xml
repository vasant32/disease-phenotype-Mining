<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the feasibility of therapy with hypomethylating agents (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29760,29763,29764,29765">HAs</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> (RI) has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 41 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 15), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 9) who had RI and were receiving therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median number of administered cycles was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients (39; 95%) received a standard dose of the drugs at the initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (22%) required treatment interruptions or discontinuation, and 10 patients (24%) required dose reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 63%, and 4 patients (10%) achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (51%) experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression-related toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization was required in 68% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 12 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL per minute or less, 6 required dose reductions attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> (n = 3) or to worsening renal function (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) at 18 months was 12%, and the median OS was 8.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of HA in patients with RI is feasible, but is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dose adjustments and the use of growth factor may be necessary for some patients </plain></SENT>
