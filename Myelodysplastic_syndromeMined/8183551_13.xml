<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate expression of the Evi-1 zinc finger gene is associated with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in mice and humans and has been hypothesized to contribute to pathology by blocking myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 contains two domains of zinc fingers, an amino-terminal domain of seven fingers and a carboxyl domain of three fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first domain binds a consensus sequence of GA(C/T)AAGATAAGATAA in binding and amplication reactions or GATA repeat containing regions of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments described here, establish a consensus sequence for the carboxyl domain of zinc fingers consisting of GAAGATGAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike the first domain, the consensus sequence established for the carboxyl domain is identical to that which would be predicted by the current rules relating to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27518,29854,46880">C2H2</z:chebi> zinc fingers and DNA recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substitution of sequences in finger 8 with those in finger 9, demonstrate that the individual fingers bind the predicted region of the consensus sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to engineer binding of constructs containing the carboxyl domain, a variety of mutations were made in the middle finger that would be predicted to change the consensus sequence in specific ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, most of the mutations were deleterious and destroyed specific DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although Evi-1 contains potential transcriptional activation domains, it was not able to activate gene transcription from CAT constructs containing the consensus sequence </plain></SENT>
