<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphisms in the promoter of CYP3A4 (CYP3A4*1B) and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (NQO1609C--&gt;T substitution) have been associated with the risk of t-ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) affects CYP3A activity and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele (CYP3A5*1) is in partial linkage with the CYP3A4*1B allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the genotype frequencies for the CYP3A5*3, the CYP3A4*1B and the NQO1609C--&gt;T substitution in 224 children with ALL who did not develop t-ML (controls) and in 53 children with ALL who did develop the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies differed significantly among whites, blacks and Hispanics (P &lt; 0.001 for CYP3A5*3, P &lt; 0.001 for CYP3A4*1B and P = 0.004 for NQO1609), thus we performed the comparisons between ALL controls and t-ML patients after accounting for race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in the CYP3A4*1B allele distribution between ALL controls and t-ML patients in whites (P = 0.339, 6.6% vs. 9.8%), blacks (P = 0.498, 93.8% vs. 87.5%) or Hispanics (P = 0.523, 39.1% vs. 25.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies for the NQO1609C--&gt;T allele did not differ between control and t-ML groups in whites (P = 0.191, 35.0% vs. 44.9%), blacks (P = 0.664, 37.5% vs. 37.5%) or Hispanics (P = 0.447, 65.2% vs. 50.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no differences between the control and t-ML group in the incidence of homozygous CYP3A5*3 genotypes: 82.0% vs. 85.4% in whites (P = 0.403), 6.5% vs. 12.5% in blacks (P = 0.508), and 69.6% vs. 75.0% in Hispanics (P= 0.663) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support an association between common CYP3A4, NQO1 or CYP3A5 polymorphisms and the risk of t-ML in children treated for ALL </plain></SENT>
