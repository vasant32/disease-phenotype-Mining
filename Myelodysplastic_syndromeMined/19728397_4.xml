<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center for patients who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy between January 2001 and December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were a known history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancy</z:e> and a newly detected, undiagnosed pulmonary lesion on chest CT that required tissue sampling for diagnosis; 213 met these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed the biopsy results for diagnostic yield, factors affecting diagnostic yield and effect on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 213 procedures, 191 (89.7%) yielded sufficient material for pathologic analysis; 130 (60%) yielded specific diagnoses, while 61 (28.6%) yielded nonspecific benign diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions larger than 1 cm, cavitary lesions and lung masses were more likely to yield a specific diagnosis than were lesions smaller than 1 cm, lung nodules and consolidations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common specific diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (62.8%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (34.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter was more common in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, cavitary lung lesions or consolidations, active underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, respiratory signs and symptoms and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, bone marrow transplant recipients, and in patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lung lesions discovered upon follow-up imaging in patients who did not have any respiratory signs/symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> were mostly malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic changes were more likely after a specific diagnosis than after a nonspecific diagnosis or a nondiagnostic biopsy (88.4% vs. 18.1%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT-guided lung biopsy has a high diagnostic yield in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancies</z:e> that present with unexplained pulmonary lesions and provides a specific diagnosis in a majority of these patients, leading to therapeutic changes </plain></SENT>
