<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because natural killer (NK) cells can be potent anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effectors after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we investigated NK reconstitution and receptor expression in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, focusing on the activating receptors that trigger anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined that NK levels in the peri-transplant period were inversely proportional to the dramatic rise and fall in plasma levels of the NK homeostatic cytokine IL-15, which increased more than 50-fold from pretreatment to the day of transplant during the lymphoreductive preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in NK cells cultured with IL-15, we observed an up-regulation of the activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, and NKp46, associated with an increase in anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the expression of these activating receptors increased significantly during the early post-transplant period, concurrent with a rapid increase in total NK cells and a shift toward increased expression of CD56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the cytokine milieu of transplants, in particular elevated levels of IL-15, may contribute to anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> efficacy post-transplant by enhancing the recovery of NK subsets and modulating expression of activating receptors </plain></SENT>
