<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) can be detected in a substantial proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, de novo as well as secondary or therapy-related, and are associated with an adverse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive analysis of the chromosomal rearrangements in these complex karyotypes has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, our knowledge concerning the cytogenetics of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) study of CCAs in 36 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>M-FISH generated a genome-wide analysis of chromosomal aberrations in CCAs, establishing several cytogenetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>-5/5q- was demonstrated in the majority of patients (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other rearrangements (present with or without -5/5q-) included: deletion of 7q (47%), 3q rearrangements (19%), and MLL copy gain or amplification (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genetic subgroups seem to display biological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>: MLL copy gain or amplification in association with 5q- was detected only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and was significantly associated with extremely short survival (median overall survival: 30 days, P = 0.0102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A partially cryptic t(4;5)(q31;q31), a balanced t(1;8)(p31;q22), and an unbalanced der(7)t(7;14)(q21;q13) were detected as possible new recurrent rearrangements in association with CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Novel reciprocal translocations included t(5;11)(q33;p15)del(5)(q13q31) and t(3;6)(q26;q25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with CCAs can be subdivided into molecular cytogenetic subclasses, which could reflect different clinical behavior and prognosis, and that three recurrent chromosomal aberrations are associated with karyotype complexity </plain></SENT>
