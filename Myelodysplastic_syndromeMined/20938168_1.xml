<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained to determine the presence of Hp-I using a rapid urease test, i.e. the Campylobacter-like organism (CLO) test, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood (PB) flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19 and CD34 was conducted in 35 patients and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hp-I was detected by: (a) serology in 75.34% of patients (p = 0.000), (b) INFAI in 57.69% of patients, (c) CLO in 60.71% of patients and (d) histological confirmation in 80.36% of patients (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation between Hp-I and CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19 expression, leukemic transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in 20 cases, significant variation in the PB lymphocytic proportion possibly attributable to Hp-I was ascertained, in contrast to the expected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there is no evidence for a causal relationship between Hp-I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the increased prevalence of Hp-I among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is an interesting finding that deserves further investigation as it may indicate a common factor causing susceptibilities to both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and Hp-I or that Hp might influence the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
