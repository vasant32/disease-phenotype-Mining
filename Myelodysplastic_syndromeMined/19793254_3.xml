<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune-dysregulation</z:hpo> for emergence, dominance and progression of dysplastic clones has been suggested, but valuable criteria to obtain insight into these connections are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed significant increase of CD8 lymphocytes and mature B cells in the bone marrow (BM) compared to peripheral blood (PB) of low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different BM levels of Regulatory T cells (Treg) identified two sub-groups in these patients; only the sub-group with lower Treg percentage showed BM recruitment of CD8 lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different levels of CD54 on BM CD8 cells revealed two sub-groups of Intermediate-1 (Int-1) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sub-group with higher CD54 expression on BM CD8 showed high levels of this molecule also on CD4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM recruitment of CD8 lymphocytes in the low risk group and/or the presence of high CD54 expression on BM CD8 in Int-1 patients were associated with more pronounced dyserythropoiesis and erythropoietin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data shed light on the involvement of immune-mediated mechanisms in Low and Int-1 risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and suggest that BM versus PB levels of immune effectors could represent useful criteria for a more homogeneous grouping of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
