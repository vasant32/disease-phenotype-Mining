<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior to 2007, the erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa were indicated for use in chemotherapyinduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> to achieve target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels of approximately 12 grams per deciliter (gm per dL), and treatment was to be withheld if Hb exceeded 13 gm per dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In March 2007, the FDA changed the labeling of the ESAs to add boxed warnings, updated in November 2007, to include the following key points: (a) ESAs should be used only to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that occurs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> while they are undergoing chemotherapy; (b) treatment with ESAs should be stopped when chemotherapy ends; and (c) dosing ESAs to an Hb target of 12 gm per dL or greater has resulted in more rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> or shortened overall survival in patients with breast, head and neck, lymphoid, cervical, and non-small cell lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In January 2008, the FDA specified that the increased risk of more rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> or shortened survival was associated with ESAs when "administered in an attempt to achieve a Hb level of 12 gm per dL or greater, although many patients did not reach that level." A new black-box warning regarding this association was added to the labels of the ESAs in March 2008, and the FDA mandated further label changes on July 30, 2008, that ESA therapy should not be initiated in patients receiving chemotherapy at Hb levels of 10 gm per dL or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To (a) assess the prevalence and predictors of ESA administrations at Hb levels above 12 gm per dL among patients with a diagnosis of solid or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who began their first regimen of conventional myelosuppressive chemotherapy between 2002 and 2006, and (b) describe patterns of ESA treatment subsequent to the first ESA administration at Hb above 12 gm per dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant Varian Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> database of de-identified electronic medical records from 17 U.S. outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices, adults (aged 18 years or older) with any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis who began chemotherapy between January 1, 2002, and September 30, 2006, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Hb value associated with each ESA administration was defined as the closest Hb measurement within 7 days prior to the ESA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A first ESAHb &gt; 12 was defined as the first time an ESA, either epoetin or darbepoetin, was given with an associated Hb greater than 12 gm per dL during the first chemotherapy regimen recorded in the database for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hb levels and ESA administrations after the first ESAHb &gt; 12 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models identified predictors of initial receipt of an ESAHb &gt; 12, and of receiving further ESA treatment following the first such administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 1, 2002, and September 30, 2006, there were 17,731 patients on chemotherapy, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13.2) years; 58.9% were female; 24.6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, 22.2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, 15.8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 11.8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancer</z:e>, and 25.6% had other or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8,086 (45.6%) received an ESA at any time during the regimen, and 7,606 (42.9%) received an ESA at a known Hb level (i.e., Hb measurement within 7 days prior to ESA administration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the first recorded chemotherapy regimen, 1,844 patients (10.4% of the chemotherapy cohort, 24.2% of ESA users with a known Hb; n = 1,226 epoetin, n = 618 darbepoetin) received an ESAHb &gt; 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving ESA treatment at a known Hb level, significant predictors of receiving an ESAHb &gt; 12 included treatment in a community-based clinic rather than a hospital-affiliated clinic (odds ratio [OR] = 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.40-3.65), location of practice in the eastern United States (OR for Midwest = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.57- 0.78; OR for West = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.22-0.34), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancer</z:e> rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.21-1.71), private health insurance (OR for public health insurance = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.70-0.93; OR for other/ unknown insurance = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.47-0.62), and year of regimen 2002- 2003 (ORs = 0.75, 0.74, and 0.71 for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Following the first ESAHb &gt; 12, 276 (22.5%) of the patients on epoetin and 276 (44.7%) on darbepoetin received no further ESA treatment during the next 6 weeks (Pearson chi-square = 96.1, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices between 2002 and 2006 revealed that 24% of ESA users with a known Hb level received ESAHb &gt; 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Dose withholding subsequently occurred in 23%- 45% of those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of patients on epoetin than darbepoetin continued ESA treatment after the first administration of ESAHb &gt; 12 </plain></SENT>
