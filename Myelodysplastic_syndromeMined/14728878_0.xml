<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole blood cell culture procedure was applied to activate T lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (20 mg/L) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression rates of CD(69) on CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes at 0 h and 4 h after culture were analyzed with two-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 in serum and bone marrow were measured with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an increase in the expression rates of CD(69) on CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) cells in RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients (8.32% and 9.88% respectively) and in the expression rate of CD(69) on CD(8)(+) cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients (7.92%) before PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD(69) expression on CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) cells were significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients after PHA stimulation (53.46% and 51.63% in RA + <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>; 42.93% and 41.96% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) and the expression rate on CD(4)(+) cells was similar to that on CD(8)(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of the two sTNF-R in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sTNF-R1 in RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (1.58 +/- 0.68) micro g/L (PB), (2.10 +/- 0.26) micro g/L (BM); sTNF-R2 in RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (1.41 +/- 0.50) micro g/L (PB), (1.95 +/- 0.64) micro g/L (BM); sTNF-R1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> (2.62 +/- 2.55) micro g/L (PB), (3.12 +/- 0.67) micro g/L (BM); sTNF-R2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> (1.96 +/- 0.56) micro g/L (PB), (3.09 +/- 0.62) micro g/L (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of sTNF-R2 in serum positively correlated to the expression rate of CD(69) on CD(8)(+) cells before PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is indicate that the increased early activation and activated potentials of T lymphocytes, along with abnormally elevated immunologically active molecules play an important role in immune pathogenesis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
