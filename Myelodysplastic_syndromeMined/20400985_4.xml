<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between August 1998 and June 2009, 33 adult patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with unrelated CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses at transplantation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (n=7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> (sAML) (n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received four fractionated 12 Gy TBI and chemotherapy as myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 42 years, the median weight was 55 kg and the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.51 × 10(7) cells per kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 50 was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery was significantly faster in sAML patients (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of plt recovery at day 200 was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plt recovery was significantly faster in CMV seronegative patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) and extensive-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 67 and 34%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Degree of HLA mismatch had a significant impact on the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD (P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TRM and relapse at 5-years was 14 and 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No factor was associated with TRM, relapse and EFS </plain></SENT>
