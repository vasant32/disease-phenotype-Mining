<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who later progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> had significantly decreased percentages of anti-T8 positive T-suppressor cells in the blood at diagnosis compared to those who did not (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential analysis showed a decrease with time also in the percentages of anti-T8-positive cells (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, progressing patients initially showed significantly increased percentages of anti-My9-positive immature myeloid cells (p less than 0.001), and the percentages of anti-My9-positive cells in the bone marrow increased with time (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the pooled data revealed a statistically significant relation between increasing percentages of anti-My9-positive cells and the frequencies of clonally abnormal (p less than 0.001) and abnormal (p = 0.004) metaphases </plain></SENT>
