<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and 12 controls were cultured for granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (CFU-gm) assays using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual proliferating cells were mapped at 3 days of culturing and their fates were followed by daily in situ cell counting contained within each cell aggregate until day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By retrospective analysis of the daily growth of the cells, a significantly greater proportion of noncolony-forming cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were found to proliferate initially, but failed to do so thereafter and degenerated in the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells showing these abnormal growth characteristics apparently contributed to ineffective granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present method may be useful for clarifying ineffective granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
