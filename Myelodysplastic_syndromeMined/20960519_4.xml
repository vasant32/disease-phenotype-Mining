<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a phase 1/2 study of tipifarnib in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (IA) in 95 patients with previously untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Induction consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 12 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 1.5 g/m(2) intravenously continuously daily on days 1-4 (days 1-3 if age â‰¥60 years), and tipifarnib, with the first cohort (n = 6) receiving 200 mg orally twice a day and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others receiving 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consolidation consisted of 5 courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 8 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 0.75 g/m(2) a day on days 1-3, and tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 14 days every 4-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance with tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 4-6 weeks was continued for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 33 months, 61 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (64%), and 9 achieved complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CR was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 adverse events were gastrointestinal toxicities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with historical IA, IA and tipifarnib showed a better CR duration (P = .04) and a trend toward a higher CR rate in patients with chromosome 5/7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IA and tipifarnib is safe and active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies exploring different dosages and schedules are warranted, particularly in patients with poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
