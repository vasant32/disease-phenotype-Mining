<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants to assess the cytokine network after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-4 mRNA expression decreased in five of five (100%) patients with &gt; or = grade III (severe) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and increased in 10 of 22 (45%) patients without severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-12 mRNA expression increased in two of two (100%) patients with severe GVHD, but increased in only six of 18 (33%) patients without severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-10 and/or IL-13 mRNA expression increased in 19 of 22 (86%) patients without severe GVHD, but increased in only one of three (33%) patients with severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with allogeneic PBSCT who had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, the cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in patients with allogeneic PBSCT, who had no severe GVHD, showed a similar pattern to that in patients with allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-4 mRNA expression increased in three of five (60%) patients and IL-10 and/or IL-13 mRNA expression increased in five of five (100%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-12 mRNA expression increased in only one of three (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-4 concentration in allogeneic PBSCT patients in the early engraftment phase was relatively high, while serum IL-12 concentration was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that severe GVHD may be related to the cytokine imbalance between type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and type 2 helper T (Th2) cells </plain></SENT>
