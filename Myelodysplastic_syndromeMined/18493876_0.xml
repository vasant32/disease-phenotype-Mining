<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygous deletion genotypes do not express the enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesised that individuals with homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 gene may have lower detoxification capacity towards <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> therefore those individuals may be at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> which is a preleukemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphism of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val was investigated in a case-control study in a Hungarian patient population comprising 86 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 99 hospital-based controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls for the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequencies for any of the three genes separately and in various combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these genetic polymorphisms may not be strong risk factors, if any, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
