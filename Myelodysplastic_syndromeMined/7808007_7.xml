<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the characteristics and outcome of patients with de novo or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with abnormalities in chromosome 11q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients had 11q abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations involved 11q23 in 38 patients and other 11q abnormalities in 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e>, 12 involving 11q23, and four with other 11q abnormalities; 26 patients with de novo disease had 11q23 abnormalities and 19 other 11q abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common 11q23 abnormality was t(9;11), significantly more common in secondary (9/12) than in de novo (6/26) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between de novo and secondary groups involving 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of 12 patients (42%) with secondary and 20/26 (77%) with de novo disease achieved complete remission (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 6 weeks in the secondary group and 71 weeks in the de novo group (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no long-term survivors in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results are similar when other 11q abnormalities are included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, 11q abnormalities define a population with a poor prognosis even when presenting de novo </plain></SENT>
