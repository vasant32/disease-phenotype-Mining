<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, were not effective, and he required frequent red cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In September 1995, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> developed (peaking at 10,100/microliter white cells and 98.1 x 10(4)/microliter platelets, respectively, in November 1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the patient's peripheral blood count began to decrease in July 1996, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> progressed thereafter i(17) (q10) chromosomal abnormality of bone marrow cells was detected in November 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was readmitted due to the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1.2 x 10(4)/microliter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His bone marrow has 16.6% blasts, and a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient died in November 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His hematological state demonstrated significant changes in a relatively short period and severe hypoerythropoiesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> of the bone marrow persisted throughout the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that a common deranged stem cell was the origin of 3 different states; PRCA, chromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The i(17) (q10) anomaly may have caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> proliferation of blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
