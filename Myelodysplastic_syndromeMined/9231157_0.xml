<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the haemopoietic function of bone marrow blood forming cells in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nucleoli were investigated in bone marrow blast cells and in erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic cells from 12 haematologically healthy subjects, and from 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 14 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), nine with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The investigation was performed before treatment using a one step silver staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case 50 to 100 blasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, immature (pronormoblastic and basophilic normoblastic) and mature (polychromatic normoblastic) erythroid elements, and megakaryocytes were evaluated for the mean numbers of nucleoli and AgNORs per nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Student's t test was used to compare the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other statistical analyses were carried out by the computer assisted "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>" system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, the number of AgNORs in blasts, promyelocytes, immature erythroid elements, and megakaryocytes was decreased, whereas in myelocytes and polychromatic normoblasts it was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also a difference in the AgNOR scores in blood forming cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t v RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The loss of AgNOR sites in cellular series in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may result from the decrease of their proliferative potential with disease progression, intrinsic defects in maturation, and extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
