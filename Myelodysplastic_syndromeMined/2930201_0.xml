<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients (85.7%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic bone marrow cell culture studies in the patients have demonstrated intrinsic hemopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After Bestatin treatment, these abnormalities involved in differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic progenitors were markedly improved and resulted in the improvement of hematological findings in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition to the culture system of Bestatin at a concentration of 0.01 microgram/ml and 1 microgram/ml enhanced CD4 positive T cell colony formation without enhancing CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the effects on hematopoiesis of Bestatin may be mediated by T cells, not by direct action of the drug </plain></SENT>
