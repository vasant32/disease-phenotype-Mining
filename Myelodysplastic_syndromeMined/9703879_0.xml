<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the possible connection between autosomal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> sensitive Fragile Sites (FS) and genetic susceptibility to haemopoetic disease in children we investigated the frequency and distribution of FS in the Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBL) of 56 children with newly diagnosed and untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancies</z:e> and their parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence was compared with that of 146 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (children and adults) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the Bone Marrow (BM) karyotype was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heritable FS were detected in 49 patients (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>20 children had more than one FS and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases it was inherited from one of their parents, although there was a significant excess of transmitting mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>19 different FS were identified: 14 common, 4 rare and one, 22q11, which has not been previously reported, but it is considered as important as it coincides with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> breakpoint resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FS in the PBL of the patients was significantly higher than in the controls and this increase was independent of any abnormality detected in the malignant cells of the BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, patients with an abnormal BM karyotype displayed increased frequency of FS induction as compared to patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three cases the heritable FS was found to be at or near the breakpoints of the chromosomal rearrangements detected in the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings are discussed with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific breakpoints, oncogene loci and sites where <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA can be inserted to the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that autosomal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> sensitive FS may increase the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancies</z:e> through a complex mechanism which remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
