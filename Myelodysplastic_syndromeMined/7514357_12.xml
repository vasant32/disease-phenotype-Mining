<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) biopsies from 58 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied using QBEND10, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human progenitor CD34 antigen in routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi>-fixed paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FAB subtypes were RA (5 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (9 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (20 patients), RAEBt (11 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 MDS patients whose BM biopsies revealed heavy reticulum <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither the percentage of CD34+ cells nor the number of CD34+ aggregates (defined as clusters of 3 or more cells) correlated with the presence and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of abnormal localizations of immature precursors (ALIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered, median survival was 69 months in those with less, and 25 months in patients with more than 1% CD34+ cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 15 months in patients with CD34+ aggregates and 41 months in those without aggregates (P = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients were considered median survival was 41 months in those with less than 1%, and 29 months in those with more than 1% CD34+ cells; the 4-year survival chance was 45% in the former and 18.3% in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CD34 positivity of more than 1% identifies a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients with shorter life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, leukemic transformation was observed in 11 of 35 patients (31%) with no CD34 aggregates, but in 14 of 23 patients (60%) with aggregates (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD34 immunostaining, which can be easily performed on routinely prepared BM biopsies, was found to be a powerful prognostic tool for predicting survival and outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
