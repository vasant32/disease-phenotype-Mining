<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attempts to induce a graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect have been used with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, sustained complete remissions have generally been limited to patients with long-term remission after transplant and those with low numbers of marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 41-year-old Caucasian woman with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and a high blast percentage six months after undergoing an allogeneic transplant who achieved a sustained complete remission after withdrawal of immunosuppression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of a reasonable period of observation after withdrawing immunosuppression to induce graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and the potential effectiveness of that approach </plain></SENT>
