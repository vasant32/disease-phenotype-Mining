<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only potential cure for such patients is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As data on allogeneic SCT in this context are limited we did a retrospective study of allogeneic SCT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 65 patients (16 children, 49 adults) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=33) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=32) who had chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities and who underwent allogeneic SCT in six Dutch Centers between 1983 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients are recorded in the Netherlands Stem Cell Transplant Registry (Typhon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival rate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients below the age of 40 years had significantly fewer relapses (40%) and better survival (38%) than those above the age of 40 (86% and 8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapses were less frequent in recipients of unrelated grafts than in those whose grafts were from HLA-identical siblings (30% versus 69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) grades II-IV was independently associated with significantly higher transplant-related mortality (TRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with either chromosome 5 or chromosome 7 abnormalities had a significantly better survival than patients with both chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients with poor-risk chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were compared with a group of patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics and were found to have significantly more relapses and significantly worse survival but a similar TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities do rather poorly after allogeneic SCT, mainly because of the very high relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this is the only approach that can cure some of these patients </plain></SENT>
