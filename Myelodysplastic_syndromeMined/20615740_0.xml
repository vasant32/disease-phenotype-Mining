<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of LDM in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective observational study which included patients at our hospital who were monitored by the haematology unit, diagnosed with MM, MF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and candidates for LDM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment effectiveness was assessed after approximately 4 cycles of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between February 2007 and March 2008, 16 patients were listed as candidates for receiving treatment with LDM (50% female/50% male, with a mean age of 69.6 years); of these candidates, 3 never initiated treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients with MM treated at our hospital obtained some sort of response (83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 patients with MF, 2 (66.6%) experienced some sort of response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, treatment was initiated in 3, and it had to be suspended in 2 cases due to different reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment only had to be suspended in two of the 13 patients who began it (15.4%) due to adverse effects (AE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LDM is well-tolerated and produces sustained clinical benefits, especially in MM and MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed for in-depth examination of treatment duration, new indications and the use of treatments combined with other drugs </plain></SENT>
