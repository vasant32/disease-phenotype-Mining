<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The groups were comparable regarding diagnosis, stage, age, conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis, Adverse events were less frequent after ATG-F treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF were increased after OKT-3 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis OKT-3 treatment (P = 0.01), G-CSF treatment (P = 0.02) and a cell dose &gt;/=2.7 x 108/kg (P = 0.03) gave a faster engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD grades II-IV occurred in 25% of the ATG-F patients, 12% of the TMG-patients and 43% (P &lt; 0.001 vs TMG) of the OKT-3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OKT-3 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TRM was 26% using TMG as compared to 43% in the OKT-3 group (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient survival at 4 years was 63%, 50% and 45% in the ATG-F, TMG and OKT-3-treated patients, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapses were 8%, 49% and 34%, respectively (ATG-F vs TMG, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relapse-free survivals were 61%, 40% and 37% (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients the probability of relapse was 61% in TMG-treated patients, while no patients relapsed in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To conclude, the type of anti-T cell antibody affects GVHD and relapse after HSCT using unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
