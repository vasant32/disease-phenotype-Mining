<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has been described in the United States since its inclusion in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2001, and the Seattle-Puget Sound region of Washington State has among the highest rates of the registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we described small-scale incidence patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> within the Seattle-Puget Sound region from 2002 to 2006 and identified potential spatial clusters to inform planning of future studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a spatial disease mapping model to estimate smoothed relative risks for each census tract and to describe the spatial component of variability in the incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also used two methods to describe the location of potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clusters: the approach of Besag and Newell and the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three approaches indicated the most likely areas of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence were located on Whidbey Island in Island County </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interpretation is limited because our data are based on the residential location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> case only at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, inclusion of identified cluster regions in future population-based research and investigation of individual-level exposures could shed light on environmental risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
