<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes lack malignant clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Literary data on the clonality of blood cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we examined the clonality in the group of our own <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were especially interested in the comparison of the clonality of myeloid and lymphoid cell line-ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIAL: Using X-chromosome inactivation methods based on polymorphism in human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene (HUMARA), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33820">iduronate</z:chebi> sulphatase gene (IDS) and protein p55 gene, we assessed the clonality of granulocytes, monocytes and T-lymphocytes of 49 female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 control women of various ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Though the results were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, certain trends were observed: most frequently monoclonality of monocytes was found (51%), granulocytes were monoclonal in 33% of cases, monoclonal T lymphocytes only in 8% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no case with monoclonal T lymphocytes and simultaneously polyclonal myeloid cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results differ in relation to the subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among controls we observed monoclonality of myeloid cells in one case of an old lady </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WE CONCLUDE: The results confirm the presence of malignant clone of myeloid cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which can be of variable size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The examination of the clonality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be significant for the therapy decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal myeloid cells are found least frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, most frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Monoclonality of cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> is interesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prevailing polyclonality of T lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be explained by the presence of a long-lived cell population originating from the period before the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The role of the polyclonal memory T cells in the antitumor immunity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
