<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review our experience with portosystemic shunts during the era of liver transplantation at the Mayo Clinic to provide insight into the selection of patients for these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We reviewed the charts of a cohort of 57 patients who underwent portosystemic shunting between 1985 and 1990 for the management of variceal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up survey by letter and telephone was also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: These patients were not considered transplantation candidates at the time of the shunt because of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, extensive portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Portosystemic shunts; the exact type was at the surgeon's discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: Survival after shunt surgery among patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients died during follow-up after being shunted for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and one of the shunted patients subsequently required liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves between various groups of patients indicated that patients who were actively alcoholic had a poorer chance of survival (P &lt; .003) than did those who were abstinent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein obstruction</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002611'>cholestatic liver disease</z:hpo> appeared to do better after shunt surgery than did patients with other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other factors such as age, Child-Pugh score, or presence of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> did not reliably predict outcome from portosystemic shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In well-selected patients who may not be deemed candidates for liver transplantation, portacaval shunts can be effectively employed to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> that are resistant to obliteration by sclerotherapy </plain></SENT>
