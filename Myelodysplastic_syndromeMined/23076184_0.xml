<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The original multiple-probe FISH techniques were optimized by adjusting the cell density and adding a process of protease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic anomalies were detected in 141 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) using the modified technique, and 35 of the patients were also examined using the original technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The successful detection rate and positive site detection rate were compared between the modified and original techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Modification of the pre-coated multiple-probe FISH technique resulted in an significant increase of the successful detection rate (from 85.3% to 100%) and the positive site detection rate (from 5.1% to 8.6%) in ALL patients; in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients, the successful detection rate was significantly improved from 67.4% to 99.8% and the positive site detection rate from 3.5% to 6.0% (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The modified pre-coated multiple-probe FISH technique can significantly increase the diagnostic efficiency of cytogenetic abnormalities in leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
