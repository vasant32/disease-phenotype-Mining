<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the classification system used, they comprised two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) of which one can be reclassified as juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>) and one cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or an alternative diagnosis of atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them on examination of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the two CMMoL, one had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 21, whereas the other had hypodiploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> had a complex karyotype of 46,X,del(X)(q24),t(1;7) (p22;q32),add(15)(q26)(8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The balanced translocation (1;7) seen in this patient was exceedingly rare and, to the best of our knowledge, was reported only twice in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The karyotypic abnormalities that we saw in our patients were not well recognized in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report emphasizes the importance of cytogenetic study in children suspected of suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which remains a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> of childhood, and a need to rationalize current classification schemes </plain></SENT>
