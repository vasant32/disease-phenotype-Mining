<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Loss of bone mass is usually detected after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during the early post-transplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the long-term effects of BMT on bone metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have prospectively investigated 11 patients undergoing BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured before BMT, and 1, 2, and 3 yr after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum markers of bone turnover were serially measured before BMT and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 yr after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean change in the lumbar spine (L2-4) BMD, calculated as the percent change from the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -4.7% (NS), -1.1% (NS), and +6.4% (p&lt;0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean change in the total proximal femur BMD from the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -8.5% (p&lt;0.01), -8.7% (p&lt;0.05) and -5.6% (p&lt;0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, there was little decline in lumbar BMD at 1 yr following BMT and gradual recovery until 3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, femoral BMD decreased much more than the lumbar area at 1 yr and did not recover until 3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of skeletal site-selective differences in the changes of BMD needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
