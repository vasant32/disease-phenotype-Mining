<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 30 healthy individuals were tested by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that no ZO-1 promoter methylation could be detected in healthy controls. methylation of ZO-1 gene promoter of bone marrow was found in 56.5% (48/85) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference between these two kinds of subjects was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of ZO-1 gene promoter region in the subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was as following: RA (18/37, 48.6%), <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (4/6, 67%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (19/30, 63%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (7/12, 58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Every subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had statistical difference from healthy people (p&lt;0.05), but between the subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> there were no significant statistical differences in the methylation status of ZO-1 gene, while the level of ZO-1 promoter methylation in group of RA was lower than that in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the ZO-1 promoter region in bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient shows a hypermethylation status, which is specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> with clonal proliferation, it is difficult to differentiate from many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> in clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the change of ZO-1 gene methylation status is closely related to pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, therefore the ZO-1 gene as valuable diagnostic marker has important clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ZO-1 gene may be a potential gene related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
