<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the incidence and the predictive signs of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (tMDS/tAML), we undertook a prospective study over a 4-year period of 221 patients who underwent autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only seven patients (3.1%) were identified to have tMDS/tAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral cytopenia was the first sign; diagnosis could be achieved by cytological analysis of bone marrow smears using World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with bi- or trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haematopoietic reconstitution was significantly delayed in patients progressing to tMDS/tAML compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typical cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in five of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval between transplantation and cytological diagnosis, or detection of cytogenetic abnormalities, was 20.0 months and 31.2 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pantelomeric fluorescence analysis using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization enabled us to make two major observations: (i) the fluorescence intensity in metaphases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> autografted patients was weak, and highly variable between tMDS patients; (ii) a drastic reduction of the telomere fluorescence intensity was observed in two patients who rapidly evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, early detection of tMDS/tAML could be achieved by close follow-up of the bone marrow repopulation, and confirmed by cytological bone marrow examination and cytogenetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results address the implication of several factors, such as the initial telomeric status, and the effect of cytogenetic abnormalities and clonal expansion on bone marrow repopulation </plain></SENT>
