<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies in different parts of the world have revealed controversial results on the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy suggests that HCV lymphotropism or its effect on host lymphocytes may be influenced by regional and racial factors, as well as by genomic variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> diagnosed and treated in our institute in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 212 consecutive patients (95 males and 117 females) treated in our hematology outpatient clinic between August 1997 and September 1999 was screened for anti-HCV antibodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was confirmed by the presence of HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HCV in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> was compared to that in a control group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was more prevalent in the group of LPD patients than in the control group, but this finding was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HCV among LPD patients was 7.8%, while that in the group with myeloproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> was 1.19% and in the general population 0.64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the different classes of LPD, a significant association with HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was established only in patients with diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was significantly more prevalent than HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the LPD group, but not in the myeloproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of a significant association between HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> leads us to suggest that anti-HCV antibodies be performed routinely in such subjects </plain></SENT>
