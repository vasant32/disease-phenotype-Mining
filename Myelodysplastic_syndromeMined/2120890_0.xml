<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In earlier studies we have found clonal occurrence of a 17p deletion (17p-) in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the time patterns of 17p- and morphological characters of bone marrow cells in 14 myelodysplastic patients with clonal 17p- who have been reinvestigated within 3- to 6-month intervals for 15-56 (median 37) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the 17p- frequency increases significantly with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, the deletion is positively correlated with bone marrow myeloblast frequencies and negatively with those of maturing granulocytes (myelocytes and later forms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that 17p- interferes with and delays granulocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inactivation or deletion of genetic material in 17p in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, and a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> further suggests that genes present on 17p may have a central position in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of cells in a number of different tissues </plain></SENT>
