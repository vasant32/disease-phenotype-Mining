<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to study function and apoptotic state of platelets from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with different platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reticulated platelets, platelet activation, activated caspases and annexin-V binding were evaluated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins were determined by western blots and plasma thrombopoietin by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microparticle-associated procoagulant activity and thrombin generation capacity of plasma were determined by an activity kit and calibrated automated thrombography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High plasma thrombopoietin levels and low immature circulating platelet count showed a pattern of hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelets from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed reduced activation capacity and more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signs than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with the lowest platelet count showed less platelet activation and the highest extent of platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On this basis, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> should suffer more haemorrhagic episodes than is actually observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we tested whether there were some compensatory mechanisms to counteract their expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microparticle-associated procoagulant activity was enhanced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, whereas their plasma thrombin generation capacity was similar to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This research shows a hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> that platelets from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients possess an impaired ability to be stimulated and more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> markers than those from healthy controls, indicating that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a stem cell disorder, and then, both number and function of progeny cells, might be affected </plain></SENT>
