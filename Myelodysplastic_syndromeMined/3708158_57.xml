<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a study of 56 consecutive adult patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were successfully analyzed with two refined chromosome banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients (44 of 56, 79%) were found to have a chromosome defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients had a recurrent loss of chromosomal material rather than a reciprocal translocation or inversion, as commonly found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three largest chromosomal categories found were associated with a wide range of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (21%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes, a stable clinical course, and long survival (median follow-up time of 49 months, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients alive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had in common a single chromosome defect resulting in either <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 or deletion 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had a median survival of 12 months, and four died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 12 patients with complex defects, 11 had a complete or partial loss of a chromosome 5 and a complete or partial loss of the long arm of a chromosome 7 or 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had a poor median survival of four months, and six patients died of ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the French-American-British (FAB) classification was also found to have some prognostic value, FAB subgroups were chromosomally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and showed less dramatic differences in median survival than the larger chromosomal subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have shown, for the first time, that a refined chromosomal analysis is an independent prognostic indicator in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be helpful in establishing therapeutic approaches in this difficult group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
