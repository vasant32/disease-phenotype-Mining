<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this, the largest reported trial of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> therapy to date, 1,857 eligible patients, mostly less than 56 years old, were randomized: 929 (including 143 children under 15 years old) were allocated to DAT and 928 (143 children) to ADE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two groups were well matched for presentation features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete remission (CR) rate was 81% with DAT and 83% with ADE (P = .3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of remitters achieving remission after 1, 2, or more than 2 courses were 70%, 22%, and 8% for DAT and 74%, 21%, and 5% for ADE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages failing to achieve a CR due to resistant disease were 11% with DAT versus 9% with ADE (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a slightly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in CR during consolidation chemotherapy with ADE (9%) than with DAT (6%) (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving DAT took slightly but significantly longer to recover from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> but the median number of days in hospital were similar in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ADE patients experienced slightly more severe nonhematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference between the groups in the longer-term measures of efficacy: disease-free survival at 6 years from CR was 42% (+/-4) for DAT and 43% (+/-4) for ADE (P = .8); relapse rate at 6 years was 50% (+/-4) for DAT and 49% (+/-5) for ADE (P = .6); survival at 6 years was 40% (+/-4) for both DAT and ADE (P = .9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis failed to show any benefit for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in patients with monocytic or myelomonocytic disease, or in any other diagnostic subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DAT and ADE both achieve high remission rates and good long-term survival, and are equally effective chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients aged up to 55 years </plain></SENT>
