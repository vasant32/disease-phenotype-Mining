<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, focusing on the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) pattern of their CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte expansions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 30 patients and 15 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The beta-variable (betaV) subfamily flow-cytometry analysis was performed on peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectratyping TCR-CDR3 analysis was carried out on isolated helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes after immunomagnetic separation and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We first identified by flow cytometry an increased frequency of expanded betaVs in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then showed, by spectratyping, that the CDR3 profile was mostly Gaussian in their CD4(+) T cells, whereas CD8(+) T cells usually showed skewed or oligoclonal CDR3 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we compared spectratyping and flow-cytometry findings in each patient, we showed that most CD4(+) lymphocyte expansions detected by flow cytometry had Gaussian CDR3 profiles, whereas most CD8(+) expansions were oligoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirm that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients the TCR-betaV repertoire is overall extremely contracted, especially in cytotoxic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern is mainly determined by selective proliferations of both helper and cytotoxic T cells, which are, however, mostly polyclonal in the former and oligoclonal in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such a difference, possibly related to the different human leukocyte antigen restriction, could reflect the selective involvement of cytotoxic T cells either in the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune surveillance or in an autoreactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> toward hematopoietic precursors </plain></SENT>
