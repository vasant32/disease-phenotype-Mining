<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Roquinimex is an orally active drug with immunostimulating activities demonstrated in vitro and clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility was limited to cytopenic patients with &lt;20% marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug was given orally twice weekly for 12 weeks with frequent monitoring of clinical, hematologic, and immunologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in CD8+ and CD56+/CD3- cells was detected by 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no augmentation of natural killer or lymphokine-activated killer cell activity; progenitor cells were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had improvement in neutrophil counts, and two patients had improvement in platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite this improvement, the responses were transient or not maintained after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, who was red cell transfusion dependent, experienced a complete remission that has persisted 14 months after completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events developed in &gt;25% of patients and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These side effects led to early withdrawal of therapy in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that roquinimex may be of occasional benefit to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
