<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, many cytokines have been defined and some of them used clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been widely used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), some leukemic cells may be induced to proliferate by these cytokines and they must be used with care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated cell reactivity and proliferation with G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CMF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO) in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also investigated the reactivity of some myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines to TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, SCF and TPO caused proliferation of leukemic cells in 25%, 58.3%, 8.3%, 21.1% and 0% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of this result, the use of G-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> should be regarded as potentially hazardous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TPO did not cause proliferation of leukemic cells in any case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, or in cell lines except MO7E, which is a megakaryocytic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that TPO might cause proliferation of some megakaryocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We cannot conclude that TPO does not cause proliferation of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells, as the number of cases was small and it has been reported elsewhere that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells may proliferate when exposed to TPO in 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reactivity of AM L cells to TPO is an important factor when deciding the indications of TPO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
