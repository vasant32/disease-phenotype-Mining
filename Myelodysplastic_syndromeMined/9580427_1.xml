<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of the treatment of a group of patients aged above 70 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosed in our Hospital since 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have studied retrospectively the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients older than 70 years diagnosed in our Service since January 1990 to June 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction treatment was performed, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but one, with two cycles of Ara-C 10 mg/m2/12 h s.c. for 21 days and after haematological recuperation, if complete remission had been achieved, monthly maintenance treatment with Ara-C (25 mg/m2/12 h oral x 5 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (40 mg/m2/day x 5 days) y <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (1 mg/m2 i.v. x 1 day) was begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the period of study 48 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> have been diagnosed in our Service, among them 22 (45.8%) were older than 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of them could not be considered for the study as not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data from him could be compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the other 21 patients 5 presented previous haematological processes (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 1 Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial diagnosis according to FAB classification for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was as follows: 7 M1, 6 M2, 4 M4, 2 M5 and 2 M6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these 21 patients 2 received no treatment due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, among the other 19, one was directly treated with a modification of the maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> without response (survival 2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 18 patients were treated with low-dose Ara-C (described above), among them 3 (16.7%) were not evaluable as they did not finish the first cycle of induction treatment; 8 (44.4%) showed no response; 2 (11.1%) achieved partial remission and 5 (27.8%) complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient did not show any response after two cycles of low-dose Ara-C but she obtained complete remission when treated with Ara-C and idaurubicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall mean survival was 5.7 months (median 2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-9.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients treated with low-dose Ara-C mean survival was 6.6 months (median 3.5; 95% confidence interval 1.9-11.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We consider that the treatment with low-dose Ara-C is a valid option in the treatment of elderly patients (aged 70 or above) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> because 28% complete remissions can be achieved, specially in those ones in which other more aggressive treatments are not possible </plain></SENT>
