<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a family with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo>, incompletely penetrant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, affecting at least eight, and probably ten, individuals from three generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> differing in morphologic subtype, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytogenetics, and abruptness of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some have presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> and others with protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This family does not have an unusual incidence of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>; however, one person at 50% risk of inheriting this gene developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical mycobacterium infection</z:e> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but also without appreciable risk factors for acquired deficiencies in cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Features common to affected family members, including the individual with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026918" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycobacterium infection</z:e>, are the early presence in the bone marrow of red cell and platelet maturation defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A search for mutations in diseased marrows fails to detect abnormalities of p53 or N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the affected family members, third degree relatives, have co-inherited a constitutional chromosomal banding variation of 9p21-22, potentially suggesting linkage to this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variable penetrance and expressivity of this syndrome support a multistep model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evolution, in which the gene defined by this family's syndrome is the signal step </plain></SENT>
