<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 144 of 475 previously untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, n = 87) and 'high-risk' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, n = 57) who failed to achieve a complete remission with fludarabine- and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>-containing regimens between 1991 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups were comparable with regard to age, major prognostic indicators, supportive care received, type of antileukemia response and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and were considered together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 118 evaluable patients were compared to a series of 123 AML initial remission induction failures previously reported from our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The induction failure rate was significantly lower (30 vs 43% P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a significant decrease in fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (autopsied patients, P = 0.001) and a reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> (autopsied and non-autopsied patients, P &lt;0.005) but not fungal (non-autopsied patients, P = 0.93; autopsied patients P = 0.15) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> as causes of induction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>Pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> was twice as common in the present report (P &lt; 0.005, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> almost three times as common as fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison restricted to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients in the present study yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the mortality profile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> remission induction has undergone substantial changes at our institution since our last report, probably as a consequence of the introduction of new chemotherapy regimens and supportive care modalities </plain></SENT>
