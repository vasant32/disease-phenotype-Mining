<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 69) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 43) received G-CSF 400 micrograms/m2/d 1 day before (presenting WBC count &lt; 50,000/microL) and/or during (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d and ara-C 2 g/m2/d for 5 days (FLAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF continued until a CR was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those in 85 newly diagnosed patients (54 AML, 31 MDS) previously treated with FA without G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in both groups were relatively old (median age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 63 years), and were likely to have prognostically unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (36% had abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7 [-5/-7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-CSF accelerated recovery to &gt; or = 1,000 neutrophils (P &lt; .0001; median, 34 days for FA, 21 days for FLAG), but logistic regression provided no evidence that the CR rate was higher with FLAG than with FA (P = .50), with unadjusted CR rates of 63% and 53%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may reflect relatively high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before neutrophil recovery in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up duration in remission is short, and much of these data remain censored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To date, survival is similar with FA and FLAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On average, G-CSF before, during, and after FA had no effect on CR or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates in this population, in which elderly patients and poor prognostic factors were prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of FA and laminar airflow rooms rather than more usual therapy needs to be considered when analyzing the results </plain></SENT>
