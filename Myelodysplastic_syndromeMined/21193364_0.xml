<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are detected in 40-60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified by cytogenetics including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which is now widely recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics by GTG-banding, FISH, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was done on 40 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 40 subjects, 10 (25%) were abnormal and 30 (75%) showed apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes with GTG banding and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The various aberrations observed were del 5q-, del 7q-, 20q-, +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA copy number changes including losses (30%) and gains (20%) were detected by CGH in 11 (36.6%) out of 30 karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However chromosome 7 (37%) and 1 (25%) is frequently involved in current study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the apart from non-random chromosome aberrations, other chromosome regions also involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occupational, environmental and geographical variations might be influencing the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore cytogenetic studies are warranted in larger groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases to identify newly acquired chromosome aberrations that may aid in cloning new genes involved in the neoplastic process, ultimately helping in the development of targeted therapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
