<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene expression pattern of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) from 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was studied by two-color cDNA microarray techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm the microarray results, a semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze gene expression in fifty additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five genes were shown to be abnormally expressed in at least five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, involving cell growth and differentiation regulation, cell cycle control, signaling and redox; such as thrombospondin 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, MAD, DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), and G1 to S phase transition 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD36 was also revealed up-regulated in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in early and advanced stages could be clustered into two distinct groups by hierarchical clustering, wherein a case with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and other RA patients were clustered into two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent expression patterns of 3/5 (60%) genes were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed the different transcript levels of RNAHP, DDIT3 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in different stages, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the different significance of RNAHP and ETV1 expression was revealed between RA and untypical anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the technology of microarray may reveal the intrinsic molecular features and the expression levels of RNAHP, DDIT3, and ETV1 may provide useful markers for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
