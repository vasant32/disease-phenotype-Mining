<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 39 patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> following radioiodine treatment, whose data were reported to the Duesseldorf <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> Register (8 of 3814 patients) and five other German <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> centers (n=31) between 1982 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were compared with those from 165 patients from our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> Register with therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> following chemotherapy (n=90), radiation (n=30), or radiochemotherapy (n=45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median latency of 79 months, 18 patients developed therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 21 presented with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts I/II, 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with del(5q), 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> II, 1 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> unclassifiable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment according to the International Prognostic Scoring System was low-risk in 23%, intermediate-1 in 29%, intermediate-2 in 35%, and high-risk in 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was abnormal in 68%, with chromosomes 7 (30%), 5 (26%), 8 (26%) and 3 (17%) being most frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in the distribution of gender, World Health Organization subtype, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> progression, International Prognostic Scoring System score, and cytogenetic risk were observed between patients with therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> following radioiodine or other treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 17 patients who received induction chemotherapy, 71% were refractory to this treatment or died from treatment-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival in the entire group was 21.7 months (95%-CI 10.5-33 months) and did not differ significantly in comparison to the survival of patients with therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> following other cytotoxic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> had significantly inferior overall survival (12.4 versus 28.7 months, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients developing a therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> after radioiodine treatment usually present with biological characteristics similar to those seen in patients with therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> following other cytotoxic treatment modalities, associated with a low response rate to induction chemotherapy and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
