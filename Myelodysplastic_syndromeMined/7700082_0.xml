<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the role for aggressive and conservative approaches in ANLL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we evaluated retrospectively 78 patients in a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (16 males and 15 females, median age 57.5 years, median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration 5.5 months) were eligible for aggressive chemotherapy; 17 patients (54.8%) achieved complete remission (CR), 10 (32.3%) were resistant and 4 (12.9%) died during induction from infective complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients that achieved CR relapsed, with a median CR duration of 6 months (range 2-28 months); median survival of the whole group was 8.5 months, while median survival of responders was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No prognostic factor revealed a statistical significance in the outcome, due to the small number of patients in each subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (27 male and 20 female, median age 71.8 years, median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> duration 10.1 months) were not eligible for aggressive chemotherapy; 16 patients (34.2%) received supportive care only, 31 patients (65.8%) needed conservative chemotherapy for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival of the conservatively treated group was 5.5 months, without statistical difference from the aggressively treated group; 10/47 conservatively treated patients (21%) survived for longer than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aggressive chemotherapy may play a role only in a selected population of ANLL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, while further studies could be helpful to identify the optimal conservative approach </plain></SENT>
