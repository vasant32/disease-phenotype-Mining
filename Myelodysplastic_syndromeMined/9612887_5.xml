<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of fatal diseases often focus on one or more non-fatal events, in addition to survival, both to characterize morbidity and to improve survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three statistical complications are that the time to each non-fatal event and subsequent residual survival may be either positively or negatively associated, the times to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with or without an antecedent event often have very different distributions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may censor some of the non-fatal event times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the overall survival time distribution is a mixture of the distributions corresponding to the possible antecedent non-fatal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conditions violate the usual assumptions underlying many statistical methods for analysing multivariate time-to-event data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we consider a general parametric model for multiple non-fatal competing risks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model accounts for positive or negative association between the time of each non-fatal event and subsequent survival while accommodating covariates and the usual administrative censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each event time distribution is specified marginally by a three-parameter generalized odds rate model, and the time of each non-fatal event and subsequent residual survival are combined under a bivariate generalized von Morgenstern distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The approach is illustrated by application to two data sets from clinical trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
