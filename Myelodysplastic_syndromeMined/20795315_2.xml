<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a D+, multi-transfused Caucasian woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> who exhibited several alloantibodies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D alloantibodies do not occur in patients with most weak D types, but some patients with a weak D phenotype, including those with type 21, can produce antibodies to nonself <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> D antigen </plain></SENT>
