<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 50 t-MN patients (34 MDS and 16 AML) selected among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (AZA) at 10 Italian Hematology Centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had developed a t-MN at a median of 6.5 years (range 1.7- 29) after treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004377'>hematological neoplasm</z:hpo>, 27 patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e>, 23 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 42% (complete remission: 10 patients, partial remission: 2 and hematological improvement: 8 patients) and was obtained after a median of 3 cycles (range 1-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 21 months (range 1-53.6+) from AZA start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly better in patients with less than 20% blasts, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and when AZA was used as front-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reports efficacy of AZA in the largest series of therapy-related MN patients treated with 5-AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that blasts and karyotype maintain their important prognostic role in t-MN also in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> era </plain></SENT>
