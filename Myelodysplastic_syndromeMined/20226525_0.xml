<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although conventional cytogenetics is considered the gold standard to detect chromosomal abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is being increasingly used additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the real contribution of FISH analysis in the cytogenetic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH studies are able to reveal chromosomal abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients undetected by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-four FISH studies were performed on bone marrow samples of 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of FISH studies in each patient was variable (1-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH studies confirmed the G-banding cytogenetic findings in 99.4% (153/154) of samples and detected cytogenetic abnormalities in 25% (5/20) of cases in which the conventional cytognetic study failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that FISH studies provide relevant information in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> in which the conventional cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful but add little value to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> katyotype in conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
