<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus as a risk factor for survival and treatment-related mortality (TRM) in 125 patients allografted from an unrelated donor between 1994 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received pretransplant in vivo T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> using rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had primary graft failure and severe grade III/IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> occurred in 14% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 70% for CMV-negative patients (n = 76) and 29% in the seropositive cohort (n = 49) (P &gt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, CMV seropositivity remained an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (RR: 2.1; CI: 1.2-3.8; P = 0.014), apart from age &gt; 20 years (RR: 2.74; CI: 1.2-3.8; P = 0.004) and late leucocyte engraftment (RR: 2.4; CI: 1.2-4.9; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TRM for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite monitoring for CMV antigenaemia and preemptive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> when reactivation occurred, seropositive patients had a three times higher risk of fatal treatment-related complications than seronegative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, CMV seropositivity remained the strongest independent negative factor for TRM (RR: 5.3; CI: 1.9-14.6; P = 0.002), followed by age &gt; 20 years (RR: 4.8; CI: 1.3-18.1; P = 0.02) and delayed leucocyte engraftment (RR: 3.6; CI: 1.2-11; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TRM was identical in seropositive patients with (n = 27) or without (n = 22) CMV reactivation (44% versus 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CMV seropositivity, despite preemptive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> therapy and even without reactivation, is a major negative prognostic factor for survival as well as for TRM in unrelated stem cell transplantation using pretransplant in vivo T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with ATG </plain></SENT>
