<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few clinical reports have been published describing the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ET in the form of a vascular accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe four cases of patients with no known haematological pathology who began with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and were later diagnosed as suffering from ET, following an aetiological investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> young, under 45 years of age, with no significant vascular risk factors, who presented a clinical picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and platelet counts above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, although in two cases they were below 600 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As they progressed, their platelet counts were constantly above this threshold and a diagnosis of ET was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although ET is an infrequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, it must be taken into account even in young patients and when platelet counts do not exceed 600 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet drug therapy must be indicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and the clinician must evaluate the suitability of cytoreductive therapy in patients with a high risk of thrombotic event recurrence, especially if platelet counts are above 600 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
