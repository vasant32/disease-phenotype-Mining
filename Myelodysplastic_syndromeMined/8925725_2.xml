<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 255 patients (144 men, 111 women, median age 67 [14-97] years) in whom primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had been diagnosed between 1986 and 1995 (refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> [RA]: n = 40; RA with ring sideroblasts: n = 38; RA with increased blasts: n = 76; RA with increased blasts in transformation: n = 45; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>: n = 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>69 healthy persons (28 men, 41 women, median age 33 [24-62] years) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laboratory range for sTK was between 0.9 and 4.9 U/microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At time of diagnosis 83% of patients had sTK levels higher than 5 U/microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between sTK levels and the proportion of medullary blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But serum sTK levels correlated with LDH activity (P &lt; 0.0005) and with peripheral leukocyte count (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times patients with sTK levels &lt; 10 U/microliter had a higher survival rate than those &gt; or = 10 U/microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative survival rates in both groups was 69 +/- 10% (&lt; 10 U/microliter) and 43 +/- 11% (&gt; or = 10 U/microliter), respectively, after 2 years and 37 +/- 9% (&lt; 10 U/microliter) and 20 +/- 7% (&gt; or = 10 U/microliter) after 5 years (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that sTK, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and proportion of medullary blasts were independent prognostic survival factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have an increased sTK level when the diagnosis is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This reflects the impaired proliferation and differentiation of haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>sTK is a simply and rapidly measured prognostic indicator for estimating survival probability of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
