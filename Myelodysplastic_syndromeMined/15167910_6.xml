<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 23 patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at presentation, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts, RA and excess blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> RAEBt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean platelet count was 167.9 x 109/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a platelet count less than 70 x 109/l were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) was 2.7 min </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation (PA) was studied with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (Epi), <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), ristocetin and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 16 (70%) patients had PA abnormality, 65% had impaired Epi-induced PA, 57% demonstrated reduced <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AA, ristocetin and collagen was decreased PA in 48, 22 and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (22%) demonstrated spontaneous PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only seven patients (30%) were found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five inducers </plain></SENT>
