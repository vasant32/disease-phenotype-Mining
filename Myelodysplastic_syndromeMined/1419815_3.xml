<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical, haematological and cytogenetic features of three patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with complex bone marrow karyotypes when first cytogenetically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction chemotherapy led to remission from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither clinically nor morphologically did this remission mean a return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two patients who displayed myelodysplastic features before and when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was diagnosed, again developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and the third patient, who had a long history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002872'>polycythaemia</z:mp> vera, returned to this myeloproliferative condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nor was cytogenetic normalization achieved; instead, abnormal cell clones were found in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the karyotypic aberrations present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> diagnosis had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The solitary anomalies that were detected in these reemerging clones must correspond to the primary cytogenetic aberrations of the patients pre-leukaemic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were del(5) (q11q33) and del(17) (p11) in the two myelodysplastic cases, and der(18)t(9;18) (p11;p11) in the patient with long-standing <z:mp ids='MP_0002872'>polycythaemia</z:mp> vera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other, secondary, aberrations were probably the leukaemogenic changes, and with the eradication or reduction of the subclones containing them, the leukaemic phenotype disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three cases add cytogenetic evidence to the growing understanding that the remission obtained in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> is actually a return to a preleukaemic, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic, syndrome </plain></SENT>
