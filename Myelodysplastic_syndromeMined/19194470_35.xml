<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated cellular and molecular effects of the three substances relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in Kasumi-1 AML blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under in vitro conditions mimicking those used in clinical trials, the DNMT inhibitors inhibited proliferation and triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but did not induce myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNMT inhibitors showed no interference with cell-cycle progression whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> treatment resulted in an S-phase arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative methylation analysis of hypermethylated gene promoters and of genome-wide LINE1 fragments using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing and MassARRAY suggested that the hypomethylating potency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> was stronger than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> showed no hypomethylating activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a comparative gene expression analysis, we found that the effects of each DNMT inhibitor on gene transcription were surprisingly different, involving several genes relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the gene methylation and expression analyses suggested that the effects of DNMT-inhibiting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogues on the cellular transcriptome may, in part, be unrelated to direct promoter DNA hypomethylation, as previously shown by others </plain></SENT>
