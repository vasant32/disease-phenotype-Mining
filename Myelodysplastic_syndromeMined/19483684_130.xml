<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but the genes affected have remained largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify relevant genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we conducted SNP array-based genomic profiling and genomic sequencing in 102 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and identified acquired deletions and missense and nonsense mutations in the TET2 gene in 26% of these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using allele-specific assays, we detected TET2 mutations in most of the bone marrow cells (median 96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mutations were encountered in various lineages of differentiation including CD34(+) progenitor cells, suggesting that TET2 mutations occur early during disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In healthy tissues, TET2 expression was shown to be elevated in hematopoietic cells with highest expression in granulocytes, in line with a function in myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TET2 is the most frequently mutated gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> known so far </plain></SENT>
