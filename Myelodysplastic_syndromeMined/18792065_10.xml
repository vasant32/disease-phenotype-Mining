<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying the development of multiple symptoms has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To explore the role of inflammatory cytokines in the development of treatment-related symptoms, we studied dynamic changes in symptoms and in serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor 1 [sTNF-R1], IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and IL-12p40p70) from pretherapy throughout the first 30 days of allo-HSCT in 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured multiple symptoms repeatedly using the M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anderson Symptom Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mixed-effects modeling was used to analyze longitudinal data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In response to conditioning and stem-cell infusion, serum levels of IL-6 and the severity of multiple symptoms increased rapidly and peaked at nadir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From baseline to nadir (approximately Day 8 post-transplantation), increase in IL-6 was significantly associated with worsening of the most severe symptoms (<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo>, pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>dry mouth</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037317" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disturbed sleep</z:e>; P&lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the first 30 days after transplantation, increases in IL-6 (P&lt; .001) and sTNF-R1 (P&lt; .05) significantly predicted the increasing severity of these symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that release of systemic inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, corresponds to an increase in treatment-related multiple-symptom burden during the nadir period of allo-HSCT </plain></SENT>
