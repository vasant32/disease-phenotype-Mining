<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Methylation of p15INK4B gene in MUTZ-1 cell was detected by PCR using a methylation specific primer (MSP), the expression of P15, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B gene by RT-PCR, the As(2)O(3) induced growth inhibition of MUTZ-1 cell by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P15 gene failed to express in MUTZ-1 cells after methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression was recovered after the cells exposed to As(2)O(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As(2)O(3) could significantly down-regulate DNMT3A and DNMT3B but not DNMT1 gene on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As(2)O(3) could activate the expression of p15 gene by demethylation or/and by inhibiting DNMT3A and DNMT3B gene </plain></SENT>
