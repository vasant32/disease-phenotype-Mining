<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic features in one or more lineages are also found frequently in bone marrow aspirates from patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and have been associated with an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We asked whether dyshematopoiesis is an independent prognostic factor or an indicator of unrecognized secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, identified by characteristic chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirates from 102 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, flow cytometric analysis in 96 and successful cytogenetic analysis in 65 bone marrow aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysgranulopoiesis (DysG) was found in 55, dysmegakaryopoiesis (DysM) in 32 and dyserythropoiesis (DysE) in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased side scatter signals of neutrophils in the flow cytometric analysis (DysS) were detected in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DysG and DysS showed a highly significant correlation (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DysG was an adverse negative prognostic factor for remission rate and event-free survival (P = 0.04, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An unfavorable karyotype was associated with a significantly lower chance for event-free survival (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of an unfavorable karyotype was significantly higher in patients with DysG (P = 0.01), DysM (P = 0.02) and DysS (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with an unfavorable karyotype, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had no additional prognostic influence, however, in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, favorable or prognostically uncertain karyotype DysG remained a predictor of lower remission rate (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dysgranulopoiesis, dysmegakaryopoiesis and decreased side scatter signals of neutrophils are indicators of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in bone marrow aspirates from patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
