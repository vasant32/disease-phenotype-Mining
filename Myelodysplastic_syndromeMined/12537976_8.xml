<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1994 and 2000, 55 such patients were seen at our institution (34 men; median age of 66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indications for BM sampling included unexplained cytopenias (31 patients), staging or follow-up of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136084" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasma cell dyscrasia</z:e> (18 patients), or another miscellaneous reason (6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific cytogenetic abnormalities included a 20q deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 (10 patients), a chromosome 7 deletion (8 patients), +8 (5 patients), del(5q) or a 5q translocation (4 patients), and del(13q) (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As of January 2002, 23 of the 55 patients were dead; median follow-up for living patients is 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 dead patients, 1 died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 6 of complications related to cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides support for obtaining cytogenetic studies in patients with unexplained cytopenias if a morphologic explanation for the cytopenias is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continued follow-up of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cohort and further studies of similar patients will more clearly define the disease processes and prognosis for this constellation of laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
