<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of cytogenetic findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the independent prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities in a large series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> included in the database of the Spanish Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 414 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> according to WHO criteria and with a successful conventional cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different patient and disease characteristics were examined by univariate and multivariate methods to establish their relationship with overall survival and evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with abnormal karyotype (110 patients, 27%) had poorer overall survival (P=0.001) and higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> evolution (P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on outcome analysis, three cytogenetic risk categories were identified: low risk (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or loss of Y chromosome as a single anomaly), high risk (presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or abnormalities of chromosome 7, or complex karyotype), and intermediate risk (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other abnormalities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at five years for patients in the low, intermediate, and high risk cytogenetic categories was 35%, 26%, and 4%, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that this new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>-specific cytogenetic risk stratification was an independent prognostic variable for overall survival (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients belonging to the high-risk cytogenetic category also had a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> evolution on univariate (P=0.001) but not multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic findings have a strong prognostic impact in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
