<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study, 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, RAEBt, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> with severe cytopenia) were randomized to be treated with 3 courses of GM-CSF (3 micrograms/kg/day s.c.) alone (11 patients) or in combination with AraC (20 mg/m2/d s.c.) (10 patients) for 14-d periods, interrupted by 14-d rest periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients discontinued the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the GM-CSF group a marked increase in WBC and neutrophil counts during each course of treatment administration were seen in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts decreased in 14 of 24 courses of treatment in the GM-CSF plus AraC group but in none of the GM-CSF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the changes in the circulating blood cells were transient and the counts tended to return to the pretreatment levels during the rest periods, some more durable effects were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3/6 patients of the GM-CSF group who completed the designed treatment, both WBC and neutrophils remained elevated above the pretreatment levels throughout the 3-month period of treatment, while in one of them <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> improved considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the GM-CSF plus AraC group, 4 out of the 7 patients who completed the treatment showed an improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these 4 patients the BM percentage of blasts was also decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that GM-CSF given intermittently improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the administration of GM-CSF seems to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> of concurrent AraC treatment and may be of benefit in the treatment of these diseases </plain></SENT>
