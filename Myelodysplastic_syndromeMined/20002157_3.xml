<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the methylation status of transcription factor genes KLF5, KLF11, and MAFB, shown to be aberrantly methylated in myelogeneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells, in a series of 115 MDS patient as well as in 25 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative high-resolution pyrosequencing methodology, KLF11, MAFB, and KLF5 were shown for the first time to be hypermethylated in 17 (15%), 8 (7%), and 2 (1.7%) cases, respectively, but not in any of the patients with an isolated 5q-deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient samples harbouring KLF11 methylation displayed reduced KLF11 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and KLF11 hypermethylation correlated with a high International Prognostic Scoring System score (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, epigenetic inactivation and subsequent transcriptional repression of the KLF11 gene is quite frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with an isolated 5q-deletion seem to harbour a distinct epigenetic profile </plain></SENT>
