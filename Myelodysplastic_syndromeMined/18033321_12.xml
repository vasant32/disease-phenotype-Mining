<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no data on occurrence and significance of MF in the context of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 349 bone marrow biopsies from 200 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were examined for MF and its prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MF correlated with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, more severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp>, higher probability of a clonal karyotype abnormality, and higher percentages of blasts in the peripheral blood (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its frequency varied markedly between different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> types ranging from 0 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) to 16% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, P&lt;0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with MF showed a Janus kinase-2 mutation (V617F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with MF suffered from marrow failure significantly earlier with shortening of the survival time down to 0.5 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>/-2), and 1-2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, RA) years in median (P&lt;0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic relevance of MF was independent of the International Prognostic Scoring System and the classification of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The risk of MF Differs markedly between various subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MF indicates an aggressive course with a significantly faster progression to fatal marrow failure and should therefore be considered in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease </plain></SENT>
