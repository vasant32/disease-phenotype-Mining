<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to look for plasma proteins that changed quantitatively or qualitatively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 46 plasma samples were depleted, proteins were separated by 2D <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE (pI 4-7), and proteomes were compared using Progenesis SameSpots statistical software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteins were identified by nanoLC-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one unique, significantly (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) different spots were found; proteins in 59 spots were successfully identified and corresponded to 57 different proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein fragmentation was observed in several proteins: complement C4-A, complement C4-B, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, and endorepellin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes proteins, which change quantitatively or qualitatively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patients, and represents the first report on significant alterations in C4-A and C4-B complement proteins and ITIH4 fragments in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
