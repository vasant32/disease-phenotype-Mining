<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD178 (Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 ligand) and CD137 ligand (CD137L) have previously been described in sera of patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and play an important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that low levels of soluble (s) CD137L and high levels of sCD178 correlate significantly with a long progression free survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we correlated sCD137L and sCD178 levels in sera of 42 samples of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 46 samples of patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) with stages, subtypes, and the clinical course of the diseases and determined cut-off values with maximum probability for significant differentiation between cases with higher/lower probability for progress free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, surprisingly no correlation between sCD178 levels and different subtypes and stages or with prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or NHL were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding sCD137L, NHL-patients displayed lower levels compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant higher median levels of sCD137L are present in patients with undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M1/M2, 1,470 pg/mL), poor cytogenetic risk (288 pg/mL) and higher levels of BM-blasts (186 pg/mL) compared with patients with monocytoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M4/M5, 89 pg/mL), intermediate cytogenetic risk (59 pg/mL) and lower levels of BM-blasts (14 pg/mL) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients sCD137L levels correlate significantly with the probabilities to achieve complete remission (CR), stay in CR or with progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data demonstrate that sCD137L can be used as a prognostic factor not only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
