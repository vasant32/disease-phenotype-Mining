<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Growth assessment was prospectively done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 children who underwent BMT following BUCY conditioning from 1989 to 1994 at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The height and growth rates were expressed as standard deviation scores (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> prior to BMT were compared with 1, 2, and 3 years post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth rate <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> 1 year and 2 years post-BMT were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pubertal children were excluded from the analysis of growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age of patients was 7 years (range, 1.3-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 22/25 patients were transplanted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Equal numbers of patients had autologous and allogeneic transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for varying lengths of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pre-BMT height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (mean +/- SD) for the group was -0.4 +/- 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> for 19 children at 1 year post-BMT was +/- 0.1 +/- 1.2 and for 10 children, 2 years post-BMT was -0.3 +/- 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven children who were 3 years post-BMT had the mean height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> of -0.2 +/- 1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between pre-BMT height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and 1 year post-BMT (p = 0.49) and 2 years post-BMT (p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean growth rate at 1 year post-BMT was -0.1 +/- 2.7 and at 2 years post-BMT was -0.9 +/- 2.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The difference was not statistically different (p = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Somatomedin-C (insulin growth factor 1, IGF-1) levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 children tested at 1 year post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>IGF binding protein (BP)-3 levels were done in 10 children at 1 year and were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thyroid function studies were done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients pre-BMT and 1 year post-BMT and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Bone age assessment was appropriate for age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients tested at 1 year post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth failure</z:hpo> following BMT with BUCY conditioning in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
