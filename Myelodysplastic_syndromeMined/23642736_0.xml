<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study showed the expression of CD47 on LSC of the patients in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> based on IPSS/WPSS score was higher than that of in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of CD47 on erythroblast of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had a significant positive correlation with their peripheral RBC count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It suggested that the proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD47(+) cells increased in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> which might protect LSC from avoiding phagocytosis, and low-expression of CD47 on erythroblast in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> might be correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
