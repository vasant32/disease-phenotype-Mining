<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a longitudinal analysis of point mutations of the N-ras proto-oncogene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and a follow-up of at least 2.5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Point mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the N-ras oncogene were analyzed after in vitro amplification of N-ras specific sequences followed by dot-blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lysed cells scraped from archived blood and bone marrow smears were used as template for a polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 of 90 patients tested (3.3%), a mutation in codon 12 could be detected in the most recent blood smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> available blood and bone marrow samples of these patients were subsequently analyzed for the occurrence of that particular mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases the mutation was not detectable at diagnosis, but was acquired later during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of these patients this event was associated with rapid deterioration and transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the third patient showed a protracted course during a period of 5 years after acquisition of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that activation of the N-ras protooncogene in these three patients represents a secondary phenomenon associated with disease progression in some cases, but compatible with stable disease in others </plain></SENT>
