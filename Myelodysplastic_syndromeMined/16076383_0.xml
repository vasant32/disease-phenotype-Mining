<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1992, based on a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> deficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> derivatives were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> did not improve, and red blood cells had to be transfused subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfusion volume was gradually increased afterward, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> progressed, probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8050">phenacetin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1998, when hemodialysis started, epoetin therapy was started with a dose of 3000 units three times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In July 2001, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> type was diagnosed through bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Afterwards the transfusion volume was gradually reduced, and transfusions were not performed after March 2002 </plain></SENT>
