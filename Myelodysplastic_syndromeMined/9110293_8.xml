<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of two men, aged 48 and 71 years, with granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of the testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both presented with left testicular swelling and underwent orchiectomy, which revealed cream-colored to yellow-tan, rubbery-to-firm, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumors</z:e> with extensive paratesticular spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the younger patient was composed of a uniform population of primitive cells with scant cytoplasm and was initially misinterpreted as malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staging revealed no extrascrotal spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy and remained free of disease for 12 years, at which time he died of unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The older patient had a history of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> contained cells with bright eosinophilic, occasionally granular cytoplasm, consistent with myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of a prominent component of myelocytes, with round, eccentric nuclei and moderately abundant cytoplasm, and because of an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate that contained mature plasma cells, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was initially misinterpreted as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, although it was reinterpreted as a granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> before initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells in both cases were positive with a chloroacetate esterase stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining revealed expression of myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, leukocyte common antigen, and CD43, but not of B-cell-specific or T-cell-specific antigens in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> are apt to be misinterpreted as other hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which may result in a significant error in management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis should at least be thought of any time the diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> of the testis is being considered </plain></SENT>
