<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN production in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>noninsulin-dependent diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e>, and asymptomatic HIV-1 infection was lower than that in healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, periodic measurements of IFN production revealed decreasing IFN producing capacities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> with progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, increased IFN-producing capacities were observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> after standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further experiments showed that the main type of IFN induced in whole blood cultures was IFN-alpha, and decreased IFN production in patients did not result from a decreased number of leukocytes but rather from an impairment of cellular IFN production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of IFN production in whole blood cell cultures may be a feasible method of assessing the impaired immune status </plain></SENT>
