<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequently affected chromosomes were chromosomes 5, 7, 11, 17 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletion of 5q only found in 9 (23%) of the patients with chromosomal changes occurred similarly as simple chromosomal changes most frequently in the prognostically more favourable group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostically adverse <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7 was found in 3 patients in group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t but only as part of complex chromosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter were encountered most frequently in patients of groups <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, similarly as <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in these groups had also a significantly shorter survival time (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 17.7 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t 14.2 months) than patients in group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA (31.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of survival according to Kaplan-Meyer's curve revealed significantly longer survival of patients without cytogenetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory, cytogenetic and clinical findings in four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> differed from findings of the remaining patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This supports the view that this sub-group is rather a myoproliferative conditions than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transformation to AL was proved in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>14 of them (74%) had a chromosomal change at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
