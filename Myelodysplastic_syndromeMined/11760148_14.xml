<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the outcome of HLA-matched related donor alloSCT following nonmyeloablative preparative therapy in 13 patients (median age, 38 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335737" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed hematologic malignancies</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, n = 4; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, n = 1; non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, n = 6; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, n = 2) after initial autoSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median time from autoSCT to alloSCT was 12 months (range, 3-24 months); 6 patients had chemotherapy-refractory disease following autoSCT, 6 were in untreated relapse, and 1 had a partial response from salvage chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preparative therapy consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 150-200 mg/kg; peritransplantation anti-thymocyte globulin; thymic irradiation (in patients who had not received previous mediastinal irradiation); and a very short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> as GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved initial mixed chimerism as defined by greater than 1% donor peripheral white blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients, who had no evidence of GVHD, received prophylactic DLI beginning 5 to 6 weeks after transplantation for conversion of mixed chimerism to full donor hematopoiesis and to optimize a graft-versus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed conversion to full donor chimerism and 1 lost the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade II or greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients achieved a complete response; 6 had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of the 13 patients is currently 10 months (range, 3-39 months), with an overall survival probability at 2 years of 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-73%) and a disease-free survival probability at 2 years of 37.5% (95% CI, 12%-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, this novel nonmyeloablative alloSCT strategy followed by prophylactic DLI was well tolerated and can result in durable disease-free survival among patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> after a failed autoSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up and evaluation of additional patients are required to conclusively establish the role of this strategy in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> after an autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
