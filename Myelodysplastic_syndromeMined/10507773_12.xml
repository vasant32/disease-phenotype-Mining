<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support has become the standard salvage therapy for patients failing chemotherapy, but there have been reports of a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) following such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who receive such therapy form a selected group, however, who have already been subjected to other leukaemogenic factors, such as treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a retrospective comparative study of 4576 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> from the BNLI and UCLH Hodgkin's databases, which includes 595 patients who have received a transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis including Cox's proportional hazards multivariate regression model with time-dependent covariates was employed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following adjustment for these factors in the multivariate model the relative risk associated with transplantation was 1.83 (95% CI 0.66-5.11, P = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
