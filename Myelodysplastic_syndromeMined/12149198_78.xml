<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplantation, 69 patients had less than 5% myeloblasts in the marrow, and 40 patients had more advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 evaluable patients had engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) were 56% for related and 59% for unrelated recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of relapse were 16% for related and 11% for unrelated recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days (3 years) was 12% (28%) for related and 13% (30%) for unrelated recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only factor significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (de novo better than treatment related; P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly correlated with relapse were advanced French-American-British classification (P =.002) and International Prognostic Scoring System score (P =.009), poor-risk cytogenetics (P =.03), and treatment-related etiology (P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the factors examined was statistically significant for NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient age and donor type had no significant impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> tended to be superior in patients receiving transplants with peripheral blood rather than marrow stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a targeted BUCY regimen provided effective transplant conditioning for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> receiving transplants from HLA-identical siblings or alternative donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although there was still considerable nonrelapse morbidity and mortality, the present regimen was used successfully even in patients older than 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
