<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To improve outcomes in localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> and to reduce the duration of preoperative chemotherapy, we conducted a phase ii trial assessing the efficacy of an intensive protracted regimen without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (api-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ai</z:e> regimen) in adolescent and adult patients with newly diagnosed disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Induction chemotherapy consisted of 2 cycles (4 courses) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 60 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 15), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> 100 mg/m(2) (day 1), and ifosfamide 5 g/m(2) (days 2 and 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was good histologic response [ghr (â‰¤5% identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From March 1993 to March 2000, 32 patients [median age: 21 years (range: 15-49 years)] were administered 126 induction courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time between chemotherapy courses was 15 days (range: 12-32 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 3 patients underwent conservative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mainly hematologic, with febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurring in 35% of patients and grades 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ghr rate was 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 64 months (range: 30-115 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free and overall survivals were 65% [95% confidence interval (ci): 48%-79%] and 69% (95% ci: 50%-83%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> occurred: 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (M5) in a poor responder with concomitant relapse, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in a patient achieving ghr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite hematologic toxicity, the results observed with the api-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ai</z:e> regimen compare favourably with those observed during previous induction chemotherapy containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in adult patients and the pediatric population treated at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These promising results have to be validated by an ongoing national multicentre trial coordinated by the French <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>Sarcoma</z:hpo> Group </plain></SENT>
