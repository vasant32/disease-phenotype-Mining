<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: HIV-1 infection is associated with various quantitative and qualitative changes in haemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clear distinction between primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may not always be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive analyses used in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> include cytogenetics and flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Much focus has been placed on establishing FCM guidelines aiding in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and to distinguish this condition from secondary dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the parameters often cited is the CD10 expression on the granulocyte population, as this marker denotes granulocytic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the expression level of CD10 on granulocytes in HIV positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 117 HIV-1 positive and 29 HIV-1 negative patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirate samples were evaluated in terms of morphological abnormality as well as CD10 expression on the granulocytic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average CD10 expression among the HIV-1 positive patients were markedly reduced, at 18.4%, and 113 patients (96.6%) of these patients had expression levels below 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Disease conditions causing secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, especially HIV-1 infection, is associated with a marked reduction in CD10 expression on the granulocyte population independent from the presence of myelodysplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This marker is therefore of doubtful significance as a diagnostic tool in distinguishing between primary and secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
