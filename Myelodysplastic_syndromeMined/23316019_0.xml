<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed GPI-APs expression on six major lineage cells in a total of 574 patients with bone marrow (BM) failure in which microenvironment itself is thought to be unaffected, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPI-APs-deficient (GPI-APs(-) ) cells were detected in 250 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas the GPI-APs(-) cells were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six lineages in a majority of patients who had higher proportion ([dbmtequ]3%) of GPI-APs(-) cells, they were detected in only limited lineages in 92.9% of cases in the lower proportion (&lt;3%) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 250 cases, the same lineages of GPI-APs(-) cells were detected even after 6-18-month intervals, indicating that the GPI-APs(-) cells reflect hematopoiesis maintained by a self-renewing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> in most of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clones with limited lineages seen in mild cases of AA was similar to that in severe cases, and clones with limited lineages were seen even in two health volunteer cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest most individual <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> produce only restricted lineages even in a steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While this restriction could reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the developmental potential of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, we propose an alternative model in which the BM microenvironment is mosaic in supporting commitment of progenitors toward distinct lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our computer simulation based on this model successfully recapitulated the observed clinical data </plain></SENT>
