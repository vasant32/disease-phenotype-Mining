<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet peroxidase has always been demonstrated in abnormal megakaryocytes and early megakaryoblasts in such syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with marked morphological abnormalities of megakaryocytes in which ultrastructural studies showed the coexistence of platelet peroxidase positive and platelet peroxidase negative megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This enzymatic deficiency was confirmed by the ultrastructural study of circulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case appears to be the first report of a partial platelet peroxidase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It adds to the enzymatic abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> already described for the red cells and the granulocytic cells </plain></SENT>
