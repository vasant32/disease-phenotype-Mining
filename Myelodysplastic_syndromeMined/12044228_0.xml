<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Poor graft function without signs of graft rejection following allogeneic BMT (allo-BMT) occurs in around 9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of hazardous complications may be encountered, leading to life-threatening situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe three patients who underwent allo-BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in first complete remission and untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three patients experienced prolonged and profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, despite growth factors and transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was not corrected by donor leukocytes infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They received a boost of CD34(+) positively-selected cells from their HLA-identical sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A rapid improvement of peripheral blood cell counts was observed in both patients who were in full donor chimerism status at time of boost infusion, whereas the patient with mixed chimerism did not show any signs of improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither patient suffered further exacerbation of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Allogeneic positively-immunoselected CD34(+) cells can represent an interesting alternative treatment for poor graft function following allo-BMT, in the absence of graft rejection signs </plain></SENT>
