<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial chest radiographs and CT scans obtained in 12 patients with serologically proven Legionella pneumophila <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest CT findings were analyzed with regard to patterns and distributions of pulmonary abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 12 patients were in an immunocompromised state, that is, steroid therapy (n = 8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), and 6 of the 8 steroid users were on high-dose steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed multilobar or multisegmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CT findings were categorizable as; predominantly airspace consolidations (n = 6), mixed lesions with lobular consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 3), and pure GGO lesions (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 patients on high-dose steroid therapy had lobar consolidations with (n = 4) or without a cavity (n = 1), and 1 patient had a mixed lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common CT findings in legionella <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were multilobar or multisegmental consolidation and GGO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cavitary lobar consolidation occurred commonly in patients on high-dose steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
