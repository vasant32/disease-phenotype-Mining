<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to develop a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) in a large series of 558 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (training cohort, Spanish Group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo>) and to validate it in an independent series of 274 patients (validation cohort, Heinrich Heine University Hospital, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, and San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most relevant variables for overall survival (OS) and evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were FAB and WHO <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> subtypes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>-specific cytogenetic risk classification, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CPSS was able to segregate patients into 4 clearly different risk groups for OS (P &lt; .001) and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution (P &lt; .001) and its predictive capability was confirmed in the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An alternative CPSS with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> instead of RBC transfusion dependency offered almost identical prognostic capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the prognostic impact of FAB and WHO subtypes, recognizes the importance of RBC transfusion dependency and cytogenetics, and offers a simple and powerful CPSS for accurately assessing prognosis and planning therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
