<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It represents a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of oncohematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow diseases</z:e>, which occur particularly in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this proteomic study was to search for plasma protein alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 24 plasma samples were depleted of fourteen high-abundant plasma proteins, analyzed with 2D <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, compared, and statistically processed with Progenesis SameSpots software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins were identified by nanoLC-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein 4 and leucine-rich alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> were relatively quantified using mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>56 significantly differing spots were found; and in 52 spots 50 different proteins were successfully identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several plasma proteins that changed either in their level or modification have been described herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein 4 was decreased, while leucine-rich alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was modified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, altered protein fragmentation, or fragments modifications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes proteins, which change quantitatively or qualitatively in the plasma of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is the first report on qualitative changes in the leucine-rich alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Described changes in the composition or modification of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 fragments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> are in agreement with those changes observed in previous study of refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and thus H4 fragments could be a marker specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
