<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify prognostic factors in these patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of transplantation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected if they had undergone an allogeneic transplantation between January 1988 and January 2002 and were not in remission or first untreated relapse at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 135 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 49.5 years (range, 19-75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplantation, 39.3% of patients had not responded to induction therapy, 37% had not responded to first salvage therapy, and 23.7% were beyond first salvage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (30%) received unrelated donor progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients (59%) received either a reduced-intensity or a nonmyeloablative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 (77%) of 135 patients died, with a median survival time of 4.9 months (95% confidence interval, 3.9-6.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-4.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A Cox regression analysis showed that Karnofsky performance status, peripheral blood blasts, and tacrolimus exposure during the first 11 days after transplantation were predictive of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data support the use of allogeneic transplantation for patients with relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and suggest that optimal immune suppression early after transplantation is essential for long-term survival even in patients with refractory myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
