<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Point mutation was found in 5 (11%) patients: exon 7 in 3, exon 4 in 1 and intron 5 in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p53 mutation was significantly higher at advanced stages (p = 0.048) and higher in patients with abnormal karyotypes (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the p53 mutations were detected at advanced stages, four of them were detected at initial diagnosis with very short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential SSCP analysis in 20 transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients revealed only one new p53 mutation during progression from early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that p53 mutation might occur as an early genetic event and is probably associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> and poor survival in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
