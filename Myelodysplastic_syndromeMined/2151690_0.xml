<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphological abnormalities of dyspoiesis of 46 patients were studied and correlated with chromosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: Forty-nine percent of the cases had abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clonal abnormalities was 36.8 percent in RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and 84.6 percent in BAEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most important aberrations were +8 in 7, HSR in 2, and "spontaneous" PCC in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter 2 abnormalities had rarely been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other findings included 1p+, dup (1) (q25q44), -2, 4p+, -5, 5q-, +8p, -12, 12p+, 12q-, -14, 14q+, t (1; 14), -15, +/-16, +/-17, -18, +19, +20, 20q-, +/-21, +/-22, -X, -Y, +Mar, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study also showed a close relation between chromosome aberrations and dyspoiesis. +8 patients tended to have a high percentage of micronuclei in their erythroblasts, and their dyspoiesis usually involved three cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with PCC were found to have more polyploid metaphases (in cytogenetic studies) and more multinuclear cells (in bone marrow aspirate slides) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study revealed that the more severe dyspoiesis is, the higher the frequency of chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We consider chromosome abnormalities to play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with cell fusion being involved as well </plain></SENT>
