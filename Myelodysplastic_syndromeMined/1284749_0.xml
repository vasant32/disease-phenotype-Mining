<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>118 hematological/oncological patients from the Frankfurt University Clinics were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received between 4 and 66 platelet concentrates for the duration of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a negative antibody screening on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>31% developed either transient (15%) or permanent (16%) lymphocytotoxic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increasing number of platelet transfusions did not correlate with the development of HLA antibodies, but the appearance of these antibodies seemed to be dependent on the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Permanent antibodies appeared in 8% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, whereas 38% of patients suffering from CL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> produced antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients (18) received granulocyte transfusions as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is striking that 11% of these patients developed permanent and 28% transient HLA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There exist no data about recent transfusions or previous pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To lower the rate of sensitization in patients with diseases such as CL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, it should be discussed whether leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates should be given to these patients </plain></SENT>
