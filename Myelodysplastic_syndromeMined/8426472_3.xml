<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to maximize the differentiating effects of this agent and minimize the myelosuppressive effects, a prospective pilot study was initiated utilizing interferon alpha-2a (Roferon A, Roche Laboratories) in the treatment of complicated or poor prognosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study regimen utilized 'mini-dose' interferon alpha-2a at 1 x 10(6) units subcutaneously three-times per week for 16 weeks followed by an 8 week observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were enrolled between May 1990 and June 1991, of which seven are evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent (3/7) had a partial or clinical response as defined by normalization of one or more of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, white blood cell count, or platelet count, or a decrease in transfusion requirement by &gt; or = 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was removed from study for interferon-associated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mini-dose interferon alpha-2a appears to be an effective regimen for some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> which can be administered with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation with interferon-alpha for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, at the dosage utilized in this study, is warranted </plain></SENT>
