<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in need of an allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) are offered one, we retrospectively investigated the policy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=90) or relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=75) between 1998 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These children are registered at diagnosis and treated according to protocols of the Dutch Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group, which provides accurate disease incidence data and protocol-indicated appropriateness for HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 48 (30%) patients, a family donor was identified; for 90 (57%) patients, an unrelated donor (UD) search was performed; and for 21 (13%) patients, no UD search was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reasons for not initiating an UD search include: progressive disease (n=10), conserve quality of life (n=1), stable disease (n=3), immunosuppressive therapy (n=2), patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n=3), patient lives abroad (n=1) and second relapse (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the time interval between date of diagnosis and date of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/last follow-up, for eight (5%) patients, it may be questioned why an UD search was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fact that 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children are given the option of an allogeneic HSCT is encouraging and reasons not to transplant seem fair in most cases </plain></SENT>
