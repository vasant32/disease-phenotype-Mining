<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotype showed unbalanced t(5;17), resulting in 17p deletion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of FISH and immunophenotype analysis (FICTION, analysis) showed that 17p deletion was restricted to myeloid cells, and that p53 overexpression was also restricted to myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly argue against a common clonal origin of MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and support the hypothesis that MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were clonally unrelated, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was indeed secondary to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
