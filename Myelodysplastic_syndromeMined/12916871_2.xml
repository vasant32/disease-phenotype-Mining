<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed the expression of the GSTT-1 gene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for GSTT-1 was performed with a pair of primers complementary to the 5' coding section and the 3' coding section of the GSTT-1 cDNA for amplifying the 623-bp band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 8 patients showed the expected 623-bp band on RT-PCR, and 12 patients showed a 500-bp band on RT-PCR, indicating that a 123-bp sequence was deleted as a mutant of the GSTT-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a BLAST DNA search showed that the deletion of a 123 bp sequence creates a sequence that is 63% homologous to human FKBP-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> associated protein (FRAP); this protein has been termed a mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We respectively transfected the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and the mutant type GSTT-1 gene in an expression vector to two cell lines (K562 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stable transformants for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and the mutant type GSTT-1 genes were made by G418 selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> could induce significant growth inhibition of the stable transformants for mutant type GSTT-1, which was indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but not that of those for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> GSTT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> could be included in the therapeutic modality for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who have the mTOR sequences in GSTT-1 gene </plain></SENT>
