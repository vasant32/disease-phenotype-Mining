<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Therapy-related MDS</z:e> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) may result from treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy and/or radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloid growth factors, such as pegfilgrastim, have also been investigated as a possible risk factor for development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>National guidelines and myeloid growth factor prescribing information recommend administering myeloid growth factors after a minimum of 24 h following myelosuppressive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some evidence suggests that administering myeloid growth factors and myelosuppressive chemotherapy concurrently may increase the risk of developing t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in patients who received pegfilgrastim and chemotherapy on the same day compared to patients receiving pegfilgrastim at least 1 day following completion of their chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received myelosuppressive chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim on the same day between January 2003 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any initial diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was clinically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 227 patients received myelosuppressive chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to follow-up was 3.47 years (IQR 1.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a confirmed diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in patients receiving concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim in our study population is 0.88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administering pegfilgrastim at least 1 day after myelosuppressive chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but more studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
