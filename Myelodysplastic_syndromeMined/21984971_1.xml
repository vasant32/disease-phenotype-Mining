<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Minimal diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) include constant cytopenia recorded for at least 6 months, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and exclusion of other causes of cytopenia and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are patients with dysplastic bone marrow features with or without a karyotype, who have only mild if any cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This condition has been termed idiopathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of unknown significance (IDUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of a series of 1,363 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or mild cytopenia seen between 1997 and 2010, we have identified 10 patients with IDUS, and analyzed their clinical course and outcome as well as features potentially involved in disease-evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged between 2 and 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression to an overt myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was observed in 4 patients: two progressed to frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, one to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and one to a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> exhibiting 5q-and JAK2 V617F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consecutive studies revealed that most IDUS patients have an adequate production of erythropoietin (EPO) and sufficient numbers of EPO-responsive erythroid progenitors, features rarely seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The erythropoiesis-promoting JAK2 mutation V617F was only detectable in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the dysplastic clone in IDUS cannot manifest as frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> because i) the clone retains responsiveness against EPO, and ii) an adequate EPO-production counteracts <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evolution of IDUS to low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may thus depend on the biological properties of the clone as well as patient-related factors such as EPO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter often decreases with age and may thus explain why <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> often manifests in the elderly </plain></SENT>
