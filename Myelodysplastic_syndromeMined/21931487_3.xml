<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the potential benefit of combination therapy of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) and magnetic nanoparticles of Fe(3)O(4) (MNPs-Fe(3)O(4)) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) SKM-1 cells and its underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of the unique properties of tetraheptylammonium-capped MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) with 2ME on cytotoxicity was tested by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell-cycle distribution and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of cell-cycle marker protein was measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition rate of SKM-1 cells treated with the 2ME-loaded MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) was enhanced when compared with 2ME alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2ME led to an increase of caspase-3 expression, followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was significantly increased when combined with an MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> of 2ME with MNPs- Fe(3)O(4) blocked a nearly two-fold increase in SKM-1 cells located in G(2)/M phase than in 2ME alone, which may be associated with an accompanying increase of p21 as well as a decrease in cyclin B1 and cdc2 expression, but there was no obvious difference between the MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the unique properties of MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) as a carrier for 2ME, a new anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, may be a logical strategy to enhance the therapeutic activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
