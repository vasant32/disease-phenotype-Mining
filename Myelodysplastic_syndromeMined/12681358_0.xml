<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have demonstrated that infusions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> are able to increase erythro-, myelo-, and thrombopoiesis in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since clonal and non-clonal progenitors can coexist in early phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we have studied if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> exerts a selective growth-promoting effect on clonal or non-clonal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, purified CD34(+) marrow progenitors from nine female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were grown in short- and long-term cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonality was studied on individual colonies using polymorphisms in the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor assay (HUMARA) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had growth of residual non-clonal progenitors at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous exposure to 100nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> exerted a growth-promoting effect on progenitors in 50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HUMARA patterns of individual colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM; 5/9) and 5 week long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC; 2/9) were compared without and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not observe preferential stimulation of clonal or non-clonal progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the stimulation of committed and immature progenitor growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>, is non-selective and does not favor nor suppress the growth of residual non-clonal cells </plain></SENT>
