<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment with erythropoietin ± granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is associated with improved QoL, but whether transfusion therapy with higher <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) target levels has similar effects is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective for this prospective phase II Nordic multicentre trial was to assess QoL, response rate and physical function in elderly anaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated to a target Hb level of &gt;120 g/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six elderly patients with low- and intermediate-1 risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received darbepoetin (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) 300 μg/wk, with the addition of G-CSF if no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the Hb target was reached at 16 wk, treatment was maintained until week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remaining patients were transfused to reach the target level for at least 8 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Twenty-seven patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rate to <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> ± G-CSF was 67% in evaluable patients and 56% according to intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients reached the target Hb level according to protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QoL scores for <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, dyspnoea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, and physical, role and social functioning improved significantly during study, with similar results for transfused and untransfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maintaining Hb &gt;120 g/L did not confer a higher transfusion rate, once the target was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two of fourteen patients, magnetic resonance imaging T2* indicated cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, however, without association with ferritin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In elderly anaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, an increment in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> is associated with improved QoL, whether induced by growth factor treatment or transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
