<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients were randomized to receive CSP only and 62 were randomized to receive CSP plus MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daily CSP was started on day -1 (5 mg/kg/d intravenously) and administered at gradually reduced doses until day 180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MP was started on day 7 at 0.5 mg/kg/d, increased to 1.0 mg/kg/d on day 15, started on a taper schedule on day 29, and discontinued on day 72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 104 evaluable patients (surviving &gt; or =28 days) had sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates of grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD were 73% and 60% for patients receiving CSP and CSP plus MP, respectively (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen for grades III-IV GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred somewhat more frequently in patients receiving CSP plus MP (44%) than in patients receiving only CSP (21%; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was marginally higher in patients receiving CSP plus MP (P = .08) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a suggestion that the risk of relapse was lower in patients receiving CSP plus MP (P = .10) and, although the overall survival in the two groups was not different (P = .44), there was a slight advantage in favor of CSP plus MP-treated patients for relapse-free survival (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that prophylactic MP, when combined with CSP, has only limited efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD prevention and may increase the probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
