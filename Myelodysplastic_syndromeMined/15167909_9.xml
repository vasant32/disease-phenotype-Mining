<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of 77 newly diagnosed patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic studies were carried out by flow cytometry in triple color combinations: CD34/CD33/CD38, CD15/CD34/HLADR and HLADR/CD13/CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 63% of patients showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and 37% showed clonal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In immunophenotypic analysis, overall 90% of patients displayed phenotypic aberrations and 60% showed two or more aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, 10 variables had a significant influence on survival: &gt;10% bone marrow (BM) blast cells, &gt;or=peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias, &gt;2% of BM CD34+ cells, &gt;85% of BM myeloid cells, &gt;7% monocytic cells, &lt;49% of neutrophils, a neutrophil/monocytic cell ratio &lt;7, more than three phenotypic aberrations and &gt;80 colony-forming units for granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM)/10(5) plated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the presence of &gt;or=5% of BM blast cells (P=0.001) and cytogenetic subgroups (P=0.008) showed independent prognostic significance by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients lacking cytogenetic information or in which the karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> additional markers had an independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis: &gt;or=2 phenotypic aberrations (P=0.001) and &gt;or=2 PB cytopenias (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results show that in patients in whom the karyotype is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or where an insufficient amount of mitoses is obtained, immunophenotype could help to establish a prognosis </plain></SENT>
