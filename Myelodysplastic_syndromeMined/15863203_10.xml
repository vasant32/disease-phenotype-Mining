<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rate of bone marrow cells diminished significantly from a mean of 43.8% to a mean of 17.5%, whereas the proliferative activity did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma TNF-alpha, bFGF, IL-1beta levels decreased variably, whereas VEGF levels tended to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 expression decreased in bone marrow cells of responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reduction of CD4 cells and an increase of NK cells was observed in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, thalidomide may produce a fairly good hematological improvement in erythroid series in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with complex biological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
