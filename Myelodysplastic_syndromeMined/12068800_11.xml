<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study, based on a long-term follow-up of 68 MDS patients (26RA, 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 26 RAEB) treated with EPO alone, pinpoints pre-treatment variables associated with response induction, response duration and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response, defined as an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> &gt;15gL1 or eliminated erythrocyte transfusion requirements, was observed in 22 of 66 (33%) evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median response duration was 15 (range 3-64+) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using univariate logistic regression models, responders displayed significantly lower baseline serum EPO levels (S-EPO), more often <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow blast cell content (RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics and no need for erythrocyte transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multiple logistic regression model, S-EPO (P=0.009), marrow blast content (P=0.031) and erythrocyte transfusion need (P=0.024) remained associated with response induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of response for a patient with S-EPO &gt;50UL1, RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and no transfusion need was 0.79 (0.53-0.93, 95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival time from start of EPO treatment was 26 months, significantly longer for responders than for non-responders (49 vs. 18 months, P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was also predicted by baseline S-EPO; patients with S-EPO &gt;50UL1 (n=50) had a median survival of 17 months, as compared to 65 months for those with S-EPO &gt;50UL1 (n=14, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> predicted survival (P=0.003) and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) but not response to EPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in a logistic regression model with S-EPO and IPSS, S-EPO (but not IPSS) was again a significant predictor for response (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data facilitate the optimal selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients suitable for EPO treatment and pinpoint S-EPO as a powerful predictor of response and overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
