<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line, designated MDS92, proliferated in the presence of interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transiently in the presence of Steel factor, with a tendency for gradual maturation, and formed myeloid colonies in the semi-solid culture condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the MDS92 cell line represented rather complicated karyotypic abnormalities including the deletion of fifth and seventh chromosomes and a point mutation at codon 12 of the N-ras oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of the MDS92 cell line are exclusively compatible with the property of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
