<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) appear to modulate the immune system at the very first step of the immune response through the inhibition of dendritic cells (DCs) differentiation and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear whether the effects of MSC on the development of DCs will be altered with disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is not clear whether there are differences in the effects between low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC on DCs development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, our data confirm that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC mediate a potent inhibition of DCs differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC greatly alter DCs functions, including endocytosis, IL-12 secretion, their ability to inhibit T cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results show that there are major differences in DCs development and function between low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC, low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC is characterized by a poor ability to inhibit DCs differentiation and maturation; and correspondingly, less dysfunctional DC endocytosis, mildly <z:mp ids='MP_0008664'>decreased IL-12 secretion</z:mp>, and a reduction in DC-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC derived TGF-Î²1 is largely responsible for the inhibitory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results elucidate the different immunoregulatory role of MSC in low-risk and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on DCs development, which may be important for understanding the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the development of novel immune therapies for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
