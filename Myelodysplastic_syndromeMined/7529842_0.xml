<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the blood neutrophil count did not reach 2,000/microliters within 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 100 micrograms/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A marked neutrophilic response was obtained in 17 of the 18 evaluable patients (94.4%), irrespective of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed a platelet increase, 3 of which also showed an erythroid improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To maintain neutrophil levels greater than 1,000/microliters, 12 patients were treated with KRN8601 for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose of 25 to 50 micrograms/m2 3-4 times a week served to this end in 8 patients and 100 micrograms/m2 three times a week or daily in the remaining 4 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well-tolerated in the majority of patients with no severe toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that subcutaneous administration of KRN8601 is safe and useful in the treatment of cytopenias in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
