<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normocellular bone marrow specimens were obtained from 87 patients without hematologic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal bone marrow specimens were obtained from 173 patients with treated or untreated neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no diagnostic difference in the differential counts from touch imprints and aspirate smears of normocellular bone marrow, and although we found some difference between the differential counts in certain cases of diseased bone marrow, the touch imprint proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for determining the cellular composition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and more reliable for the diagnosis of bone marrow involved by a neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that evaluating touch imprints should be considered a standard practice in examining bone marrow </plain></SENT>
