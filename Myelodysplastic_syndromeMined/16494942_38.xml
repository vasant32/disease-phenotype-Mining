<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide efficacy has been reported in clinical trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a del 5q cytogenetic abnormality, with or without other cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of chromosome 5 deleted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cell lines in vitro, whether from the B cell, T cell, or myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was diversity in the responses of the various cell lines to lenalidomide, with one undergoing cell cycle arrest, and others undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the most lenalidomide-sensitive chromosome 5 deleted cell line, Namalwa CSN.70, the compound induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, inhibited Akt and Gab1 phosphorylation, and inhibited the ability of Gab1 to associate with a receptor tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide also enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in Namalwa, but not in the other cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies provide evidence for the mechanism of action of lenalidomide in chromosome 5 deleted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> in vitro, and may provide a better understanding of the drug's activity in clinical applications </plain></SENT>
