<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were stimulated with formyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylanaline (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>; 10(-8) M final concentration) for 15, 30, 60 and 120 sec, and F-actin content was determined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein-isothiocyanate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52732">phallacidin</z:chebi> as a specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that F-actin polymerization was defective in ten patients, with very impaired values after 60 and 120 sec of stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 11 patients showed a prevalent neutrophil population with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> F-actin polymerization and neutrophil sub-populations with either defective or undetectable F-actin polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first group, patients with very poor prognosis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in leukemic transformation, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, multiple karyotypic abnormalities) were present, although patients with aberrations of karyotype were present in the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that defects in neutrophil F-actin polymerization may be responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp>, which has frequently been observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
