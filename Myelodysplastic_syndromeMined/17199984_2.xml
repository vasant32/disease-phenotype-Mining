<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA, n = 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, n = 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, n = 7), 23 males and 10 females, aged 46 (6 approximately 71), hospitalized in 4 CsA, grade 3 hospitals in Beijing who failed to respond to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, received CsA 3 approximately 5 mg x kg(-1)x d(-1), 2 times per days, taken orally in 2 separate doses for at least 3 months (2 approximately 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the course of treatment the dosage was adjusted according to the CsA blood concentration and curative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was conducted for 14 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The curative effect of those who took CSA for more than 2 months underwent statistical analysis, and for those who took CSA for less than 2 months only the side effects underwent statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 3 months of the treatment, the hematological improvement (HI) was observed in 18 of the 32 evaluative patients (56.3%) by the criteria of the International Working Group (IWG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up 4 patients showed alteration of disease progression, including 1 case of complete remission (CR) and 3 cases of partial remission (PR), and 16 patients showed homological improvement, responders numbering 20 totally, with a response rate of 62.5% (20/32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the 20 patients respondent to CsA died and 7 of the 12 patients who failed to respond to CsA died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improving the clinical manifestations and lengthening the survival time, CsA therapy is effective in the patients with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and both <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> and hyperplastic bone marrows respond to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CsA therapy is potentially the most effective therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
