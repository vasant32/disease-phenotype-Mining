<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Azacytidine (Aza) was the first demethylation agent identified that may inhibit DNA methyltransferases and reverse DNA hypermethylation, restoring the expression of silenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether azacytidine can alter the proliferative and apoptotic changes in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, and methylation changes induced by this drug have remained poorly characterized in therapy-related models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proliferation rate of azacytidine on HL60 cells was determined by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and RT-PCR were used respectively to detect gene methylation status changes and expression levels of p16, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> associated protein kinase (DAPK) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) before and after treatment with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Azacytidine inhibited HL60 cell proliferation and showed a time- and dose-dependent effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSP showed hypermethylated p16, DAPK, and MGMT genes before azacytidine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete demethylation was seen in p16 and DAPK genes and partial demethylation in the MGMT gene after co-culture with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression level of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes in HL60 cells was up-regulated after treatment with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CpG islands of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes are hypermethylated in HL60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Azacytidine inhibits proliferation of leukemic cells by hypomethylation of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes </plain></SENT>
