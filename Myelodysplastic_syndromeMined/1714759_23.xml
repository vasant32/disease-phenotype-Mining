<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase II study of the intravenous administration of a glycosylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) for 7-14 d in 41 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of rhG-CSF elicited striking rises in both leucocyte and neutrophil counts in the majority of the patients irrespective of the FAB subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rises in neutrophil counts were dose dependent and 5 micrograms/kg/d of rhG-CSF yielded approximately an 8-fold increase in neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leucocytes and neutrophil counts started to increase shortly after the first injection of 5 micrograms/kg, was maintained at significantly elevated levels during 14 d of treatment, and returned to the pretreatment levels within several days following discontinuation of rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The action of rhG-CSF was specific for neutrophils since leucocytosis was due exclusively to neutrophilic increase associated with an increased marrow myeloid maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no consistent changes in the monocyte, eosinophil, lymphocyte, platelet or reticulocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the percentage of marrow blast cells was reduced in eight of 13 evaluable patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> during the treatment or in the immediate follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated with only minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that rhG-CSF is a safe and effective way to promptly improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
