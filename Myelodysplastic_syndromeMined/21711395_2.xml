<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these parameters have some limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry has been recently included in the diagnostic panel for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and its prognostic significance is under evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Marrow aspirates from 424 MDS patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate the impact of bone marrow cell immunophenotype on overall survival (OS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immature compartment of myeloblasts was analyzed by the quantitative expression of CD34 (&lt;3% vs. ≥3%), CD117, and CD11b(-) /CD66b(-) (&lt;5% vs. ≥5%); myeloid maturation was analyzed by the expression of CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) (&lt;15% vs. ≥15%) and CD11b(+) /CD66b(+) (&lt;25% vs. ≥25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the expression of immaturity markers (CD34(+) , CD117(+) , and CD11b(-) /CD66b(-) ) was associated with shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> and OS (P &lt; 0.0001); higher expression of differentiation markers (CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) and CD11b(+) /CD66b(+) ) was associated with longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and OS (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, expression of CD34(+) (P = 0.007), CD117(+) (P = 0.013), and CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) (P = 0.023) retained independent prognostic value for OS, while only the expression of CD34(+) was a prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two different risk groups were defined according to the presence of 0-1 or ≥2 of these factors with significant different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> and OS (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This score showed prognostic value in predicting survival even in subanalysis according to IPSS and WHO subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may provide meaningful prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blast percentage expressed as CD117(+) or CD34(+) cells and the quantitative assessment of myeloid maturation showed prognostic value for survival </plain></SENT>
