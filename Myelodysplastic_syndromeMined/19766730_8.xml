<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The estimation of IO is based primarily on serum ferritin level; however, many confounding factors can result in ferritin overestimation, especially in HSCT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to quantify IO after HSCT using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and to evaluate the impact of IO on hepatic function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the feasibility of iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 102 consecutive allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to our outpatient department between December 2005, and December 2007, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary diagnosis included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 61% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of IO after HSCT included serum ferritin; in those with hyperferritinemia (ferritin&gt;1000 ng/mL), liver iron concentration (LIC) was evaluated by SQUID magnetic susceptometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iron removal therapy was offered to patients with moderate IO (LIC 1000-2000 microg Fe/g wet weight [ww]) or severe IO (LIC &gt;2,000 microg Fe/g ww) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients had a ferritin level &lt;1000 ng/mL: the median time between HSCT and assessment of ferritin level was 1006 days (range, 93-5239 days), significantly different from the median time of 183 days (range, 78-2957 days) in the 45 patients with a ferritin level &gt;1000 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of 42 patients evaluated by SQUID, 29 had moderate to severe IO (median LIC value, 1493 microg Fe/g ww [range, 1030-3253]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, a significant correlation was found between a ferritin level &gt;1000 ng/mL and the presence of at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> test (LFT) ORo=6.8; 95% CI=2.2-20.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the rate of proven/probable invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal disease</z:e> was significantly higher in the patients with hyperferritinemia (13% vs 0%; P=.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 24 patients considered eligible for iron-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> therapy underwent regular phlebotomy; 13 completed the program in a median of 287 days (range, 92-779 days), reaching the target of a ferritin level&lt;500 ng/mL; LIC was significantly reduced (median, 1419 microg Fe/g ww to 625 microg Fe/g ww; P &lt; .001) in 8 of the 9 patients who were revaluated by SQUID at the end of the iron-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the measurement of LIC obtained by SQUID documented the presence of moderate/severe IO in 69% of the patients with a high ferritin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that in HSCT recipients, high ferritin level is an independent risk factor for abnormal LFTs, and IO may be considered a potential risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A phlebotomy program may be feasible in two-thirds of the patients who might benefit from iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
