<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The toxicity of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation can be substantially reduced using a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has increased the proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> eligible for allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the capacity of RIC allografts to produce durable remissions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has not yet been defined, and consequently, the role of RIC allografts in the management of these diseases remains conjectural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received an allograft using a fludarabine/melphalan RIC regimen incorporating alemtuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the cohort was 52 years (range, 18 to 71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 100-day transplantation-related mortality rate was 9%, and no patient developed greater than grade 2 graft-versus-host disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 13 to 70 months), 27 patients were alive and in remission, with 3-year actuarial overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 41% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year OS and DFS rates of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in complete remission at the time of transplantation were 48% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease relapse was the most common cause of treatment failure and occurred at a median time of 6 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient destined to relapse did so within 24 months of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extended follow-up in this series identifies a high risk of early disease relapse but provides evidence that RIC allografts can produce sustained DFS in a significant number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who would be ineligible for allogeneic transplantation with myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
