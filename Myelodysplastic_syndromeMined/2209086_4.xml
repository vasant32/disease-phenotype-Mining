<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel member of the SRC tyrosine kinase gene family was recently isolated and characterized (Hao et al., 1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This FES/FPS-related gene, named FER, lacks the transmembrane and extracellular domains which characterize tyrosine kinases with receptor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of FER in a wide range of cell types indicates a general role in intracellular signalling or differentiation processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now mapped FER to chromosome 5q14----q23 using in situ hybridization techniques and suggest a more precise location within bands 5q21----q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This region lies adjacent to a complex domain of growth factors and receptors, many involved in regulation of haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FER maps within a critical segment frequently deleted from chromosome 5 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and was shown to be deleted in two such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also maps close to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial polyposis coli</z:e> locus at 5q22 </plain></SENT>
