<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using population-based data from Sweden, we assessed the role of MPN treatment and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> risk with special focus on the leukemogenic potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On the basis of a nationwide MPN cohort (N = 11,039), we conducted a nested case-control study, including 162 patients (153 and nine with subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis, respectively) and 242 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained clinical and MPN treatment data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) as measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one (25%) of 162 patients with MPNs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> development were never exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, radioactive phosphorous (P(32)), or HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with who were not exposed to HU, the ORs for 1 to 499 g, 500 to 999 g, more than 1,000 g of HU were 1.5 (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.4), 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6 to 3.4), and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.3), respectively, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> development (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with MPNs who received P(32) greater than 1,000 MBq and alkylators greater than 1 g had a 4.6-fold (95% CI, 2.1 to 9.8; P = .002) and 3.4-fold (95% CI, 1.1 to 10.6; P = .015) increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving two or more cytoreductive treatments had a 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.9) increased risk of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> development after MPN diagnosis was significantly associated with high exposures of P(32) and alkylators but not with HU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent of patients with MPNs who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> were not exposed to cytotoxic therapy, supporting a major role for nontreatment-related factors </plain></SENT>
