<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations at arginine 132 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have recently been demonstrated to be recurrent gene alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, this mutation was also found in a variety of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath>, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a few cases were so far identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the IDH status in ALL patients, we analyzed 54 adult and 34 pediatric ALL samples' IDH1/2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three adult cases and no pediatric case with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation was identified in the total of 88 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the IDH1 mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> was 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the three IDH1-mutated patients, two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and expressed the myeloid lineage markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with an IDH1 mutation relapsed or died within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the IDH1 R132 mutation might be a recurrent gene alteration in ALL; patients carrying the mutation have a trend to aberrantly express myeloid antigen and the mutation may imply a dismal outcome </plain></SENT>
