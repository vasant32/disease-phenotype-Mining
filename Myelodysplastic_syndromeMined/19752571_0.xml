<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffuse pancreatic swelling and stricture of the main pancreatic duct were observed with elevated serum levels of direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gammaGTP and amylase, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG and IgG4 levels were highly elevated, and both the direct antiglobulin test and platelet-associated IgG were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and biliary drainage followed by immunosuppressive therapy ameliorated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to diffuse pancreatic FDG accumulation, fine incorporations of FDG to the lachrymal and submandibular glands were demonstrated, suggesting the recently proposed IgG4+ multiorgan lymphoproliferative syndrome (MOLPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology of IgG4+ MOLPS is still unknown; however, autoantibodies to blood cells in this case suggested that the autoimmune mechanism, which is caused by abnormal immune functions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, might be involved in the pathogenesis of IgG4+ MOLPS </plain></SENT>
