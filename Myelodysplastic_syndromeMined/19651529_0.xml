<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we identified in 41 individuals from 824 screened individuals (290 AML patients, 382 MDS patients, 56 NHL patients and 96 healthy individuals) a single class of 23 deletions in CEBPA gene which involved a direct repeat of at least 2 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mutations are characterised by the loss of one of two same repeats at the ends of deleted sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three most frequent repeats included in these deletions in CEBPA gene are CGCGAG (493-498_865-870), GCCAAGCAGC (508-517_907-916) and GG (486-487_885-886), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> according to GenBank accession no </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mechanism for deletion formation between two repetitive sequences can be recombination events in the repair process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double-stranded cut in DNA can initiate these recombination events of adjacent DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
