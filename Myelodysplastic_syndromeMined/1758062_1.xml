<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No hepatosplenomegary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocyte count with no lymphocyte abnormality, hypogranular neutrophils, elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase, increased C-reactive protein and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirate was normocellular with dysplastic changes in erythroid and megakaryocytic lines which agree with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> which relieved her symptom but she developed high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and disturbance of consciousness and died in August, 1987 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study of these malignant cells showed positive reaction to the anti-LCA and anti-L26 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And electron microscopy showed no azure granules in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then we diagnosed as neoplastic angioendotheliosis (NAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of NAE with abnormalities in myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NAE with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> originate from a multipotent stem cell </plain></SENT>
