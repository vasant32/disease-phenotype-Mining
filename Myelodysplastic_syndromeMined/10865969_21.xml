<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the results of conventional cytogenetics the patients were subdivided into three groups: group 1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, n = 19 cases, median age = 64 years; group 2, patients displaying either one or two single aberrations, n = 10 cases, median age = 54 years; group 3, patients with &gt; or =3 independent aberrations, n = 10 cases, median age = 61.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SKY identified no abnormal metaphases in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient of group 2 a hidden translocation t(7;14)(q3?1;q2?2) could be revealed with SKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics had only shown <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar t(7;14) was also detected in one patient of group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SKY was helpful for the delineation of marker chromosomes and additional material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SKY could distinguish between partial and total <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> or real existing and apparent deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of G-banding, FISH and SKY was found very useful for the precise delineation of the karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result of our study we recommend SKY investigation as an important additional tool for accurate chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detected t(7;14) might represent a novel recurrent translocation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
