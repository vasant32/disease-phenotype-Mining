<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treosulfan is an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> with in vitro cytotoxicity against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> as well as myeloablative and immunosuppressive properties when used in escalated doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored a regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) x 5) and treosulfan (12 gr/m(2) x 3) in 24 patients, median age 55 years (range, 30-69), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 19) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 5), not eligible for standard myeloablation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With median follow-up of 19 months (range, 8 - 34), 16 patients are alive and 8 died (relapse-2, treatment-related-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-year disease-free survival rate was 60% (95% CI, 39-81) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fludarabine/treosulfan regimen can be considered a fully intensive, modified myeloablative regimen with effective antileukemia activity and acceptable toxicity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> not eligible for standard myeloablation, and merits further study in larger scale studies </plain></SENT>
