<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: During long term follow-up of a cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) a higher than expected incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MF) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to test if the explanation could be found in the diagnostic criteria a re-evaluation of diagnosis using the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for ET and MF was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study of 60 patients with ET and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> was set up in 1998 to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of anagrelide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow trephine biopsies were requested from study start, after 2 and 7 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A blinded re-evaluation of the bone marrow trephines was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2008 WHO bone marrow criteria were used for diagnosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 40 patients with an initial diagnosis of ET, 21 were confirmed as 'true ET' whereas 17 were reclassified as primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (PMF) (12 PMF-0, 3 PMF-1, 2 PMF-2) and 2 as myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of uncertain origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 7 years of follow-up, 19 of 21 patients with 'true ET' were alive, none had transformed to MF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 4/17 patients reclassified as PMF had died, two patients transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and 7 patients progressed to overt MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We conclude that a blinded re-evaluation of bone marrow trephines from study start and after 7 years of follow-up using 2008 World Health Organization criteria was able to differentiate between true ET and PMF with a marked difference in follow-up outcome </plain></SENT>
