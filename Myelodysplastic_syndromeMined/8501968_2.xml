<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Female beagle dogs were chronically exposed to low daily doses of 60Co gamma rays (7.5 cGy day-1) and responded in one of three distinct hemopathological patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patterns, reflective of distinct subgroups, were characterized by (a) low radioresistance resulting in progressive hematopoietic suppression, terminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and relatively short (&lt; 400 days) survival (-S-AA subgroup); (b) high radioresistance, initially coupled with strong but aberrant regenerative hematopoiesis, and later with the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) ((+)-R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> subgroup); and (c) high radioresistance, coupled with an early phase of strong regenerative hematopoiesis, but later with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> (+R-nonMPD subgroup) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the changes in circulating blood cell levels (granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and platelets) were sequentially assessed in time and fitted to a flexible, quadratic-linear-type response model previously developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses provided definition to (a) an initial suppressive, radiotoxic phase and (b) the subsequent recovery phase for each of these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude and severity of blood cell loss during the initial suppressive phase was generally greatest in the -S-AA subgroup and lowest in the +R-nonMPD subgroup, with the +R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> subgroup showing intermediate level responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A notable exception included a very high net loss of blood granulocytes by the +R-nonMPD subgroup relative to the other two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the magnitude of blood cell restoration, as well as blood cell maintenance levels during the secondary, recovery phase, was generally highest in the +R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> subgroup, of intermediate strength in the +R-nonMPD subgroup, and extremely weak or absent in the -S-AA subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notable exceptions were in the +R-nonMPD subgroup's high recovery rates of monocyte and lymphocyte blood levels, as well as the high maintenance levels of blood granulocytes during recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with our earlier observations of blood responses of chronically irradiated male dogs, in that subgroups of female dogs prone to specific radiogenic hematopathologies (i.e. AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) can be readily identified and staged in specific preclinical periods by a series of marked differential blood responses </plain></SENT>
