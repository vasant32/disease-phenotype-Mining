<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up study of 94 patients with AISA diagnosed according to FAB criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> we found a striking difference in the risk of leukaemic transformation between PSA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (5 year cumulative rate 1.9% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was much better in PSA than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (5 year cumulative chance 69% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> and haemorrhages were frequent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> but not in PSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow culture studies (CFU-GM) were performed on 10 consecutive patients with PSA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients showed grossly impaired colony growth, typical of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with PSA had persisting colony formation, even if moderately decreased in frequency, with numbers of CFU-GM being inversely correlated with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that on cytomorphological grounds AISA can be divided into pure (dyserythropoietic) sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (PSA) and a true myelodysplastic form (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), with both types differing considerably in terms of survival, risk of leukaemic transformation and findings on bone marrow culture (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
