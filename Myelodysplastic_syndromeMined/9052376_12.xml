<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that the bone marrow (BM) in AA is characterized by a decreased number of CD34+ cells and reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), features that have not been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the potential importance of these markers in the differential diagnosis of hypoplastic BM disorders, we immunostained 50 BM biopsy specimens of cytogenetically characterized cases of AA (27) and h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for CD34 was performed with QBEND10 (Vector, Burlingame, Calif), a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) reactive in routinely processed specimens, while PCNA was assessed by the PC10 MoAb (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) using a microwave over-based antigen retrieval technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow specimens of h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases showed statistically higher values of PCNA and CD34 than did those of the AA cases: mean values (+/- SD) of CD34-positive cells in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 0.94% +/- 1.1; AA, 0.04% +/- 0.1 (P = .0002); PCNA-positive cells in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 43.59% +/- 13.3; AA, 14.80% +/- 6.4 (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that AA is characterized by low expression of PCNA in BM and reduced CD34 frequency compared with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and supports the concept of an early deficiency of stem cells in the former disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also illustrate how immunostaining permits a simple distinction of these conditions in routinely processed BM biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
