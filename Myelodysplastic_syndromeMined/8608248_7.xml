<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in whom a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 was detectable by G-banding and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization in most or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in each case, microsatellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 15 primer pairs spanning the common deleted region on 20q showed that the deletion was absent from most peripheral blood granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor clonality assay was used to show that the vast majority of peripheral blood granulocytes were clonal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This represents the first demonstration that the 20q deletion can arise as a second event in patients with pre-existing clonal granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite PCR analysis of whole bone marrow from two patients was consistent with cytogenetic studies, a result that suggests that cytogenetic analysis was not merely selecting for a minor subclone of cells carrying the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in one patient, the deletion was present in both erythroid and granulocyte/monocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies that the absence of the deletion in most peripheral blood granulocytes did not reflect lineage restriction of the progenitors carrying the deletion but may instead result from other selective influences such as preferential retention/destruction within the bone marrow of granulocytes carrying the deletion </plain></SENT>
