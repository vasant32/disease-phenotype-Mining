<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association between race/ethnicity and outcomes of unrelated single UCBT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our retrospective cohort study consisted of 885 adults and children (612 whites, 145 blacks, and 128 Hispanics) who received unrelated single UCBT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> between 1995 and 2006 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 5-6/6 HLA-matched unit with a total nucleated cell count infused of ≥2.5 × 10(7)/kg was given to 40% white and 42% Hispanic, but only 21% black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 2 years was 44% for whites, 34% for blacks, and 46% for Hispanics (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusting for patient, disease, and treatment factors (including HLA match and cell dose), blacks had inferior overall survival (relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 1.31; P = .02), whereas overall survival of Hispanics was similar (relative risk, 1.03; P = .81) to that of whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, younger age, early-stage disease, use of units with higher cell dose, and performance status ≥80 were independent predictors of improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Black patients and white patients infused with well-matched cords had comparable survival; similarly, black and white patients receiving units with adequate cell dose had similar survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that blacks have inferior survival to whites after single UCBT, but outcomes are improved when units with a higher cell dose are used </plain></SENT>
