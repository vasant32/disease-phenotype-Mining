<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> display alterations in methylation patterns of CpG islands--stretches of DNA rich in CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> often associated with gene promoters that are involved in initiation of gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This methylation may perturb expression of genes critical to the regulation of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation is not limited to a few genes or to promoter regions but has been found on a genome-wide scale in a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to characterize, in a quantitative manner, the profiles of abnormally methylated genes that may be specific for different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a quantitative assay, methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE), we have analyzed the methylation levels of promoter and exonic (coding region) CpG islands of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors [p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A)] and the PAX6 gene, which encodes a transcriptional factor involved in neuronal proliferation, in DNA samples taken from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: De novo methylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three exonic loci in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>--relative to baseline levels found in nontumor tissue or blood--was observed in hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, methylation of promoter regions was more limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two different patterns of promoter methylation distinguished the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: p15 promoter hypermethylation was found only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and p16 promoter hypermethylation occurred only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we did not address this issue prospectively; therefore, such an observation is only hypothesis generating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The methylation patterns that we observed suggest that exonic CpG islands are more susceptible to de novo methylation than promoter islands and that methylation may be seeded in exonic regions, from which it can spread to other islands, including promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent selection of cells with a growth advantage conferred by spread of methylation into and inactivation of a particular promoter might then contribute to the genesis of a specific type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
