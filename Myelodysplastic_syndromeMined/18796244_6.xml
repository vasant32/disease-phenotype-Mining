<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A minority of patients undergo thrombohemorrhagic complications, which might be prevented by cytoreductive treatment in high risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">Alkylating agents</z:chebi> (ALK) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, whereas the potential oncogenicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) remains a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively investigated long-term development of hematological and non-hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> in 331 patients with ET, analyzing possible associations with chemotherapy treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 108 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 194 patients who were treated with chemotherapy, 116 (60%) received only HU, 38 (19.5%) only ALK (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> or melphalan) and 40 (20.5%) ALK followed by HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median time of 87 months from the diagnosis of ET, 43 patients developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e>, hematological in 15 and non-hematological in 28, for an overall cumulative incidence of 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the type of treatment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> were documented in 11.2% of patients treated with only HU, in 26.3% of patients who received only ALK, and in 25% of those treated with ALK followed by HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten cases (7.3%) were recorded among the 137 patients who did not receive any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed a significant association between treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and an increased risk of developing second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, whereas no such association was detected with regard to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> single agent in our ET population </plain></SENT>
