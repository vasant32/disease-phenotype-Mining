<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Representative pre-and posttreatment bone marrow biopsies were involved including the monoclonal antibody CD61 for the identification of precursor and mature stages of megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An elaborate morphometric evaluation was in keeping with a left-shifting showing a more frequent occurrence of promegakaryoblasts and microforms in both therapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, contrasting ANA, HU generated defects of differentiation consistent with significant dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, concern about a possible leukemogenic capacity following long-term HU therapy is supported by our findings </plain></SENT>
