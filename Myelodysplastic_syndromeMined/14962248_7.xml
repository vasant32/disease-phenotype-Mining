<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study we evaluate the effects of high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on quality of life (QOL) and brain function in patients with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (&lt;10% marrow blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven consecutive patients were given rHuEPO (40,000 IU two times a week) for 12 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responsive patients continued with 40,000 IU/wk for further 12 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in QOL were assessed by the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (FACT-An) self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiological evaluation at the start of the therapy (t0) included duplex scanning of neck vessels, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), a complex neuropsychological evaluation, and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients completed the neurophysiological evaluation after 24 wk (t1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients (55%) achieved an erythroid response after 12 wk, which was maintained after 24 wk of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FACT-An score showed a relevant improvement between t0 and t1 in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At baseline, TCD showed a mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity in the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in brain function were observed in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the eight patients who were re-evaluated at t1, improvement was observed in three responding patients, two of them with abnormal values at t0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A strict correlation between QOL and neurophysiological improvements was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high-dose induction phase with rHuEPO followed by maintenance therapy may be an effective therapeutic schedule for low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The erythroid response was associated with positive changes in the QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiological improvements occurred only in a part (50%) of responding patients, mainly those who showed altered results at baseline </plain></SENT>
