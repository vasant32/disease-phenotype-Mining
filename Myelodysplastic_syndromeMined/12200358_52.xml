<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify factors influencing transplantation outcome, we studied 452 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from 1989 to 1997, reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 38 years (range, 2-64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (n = 136) or with excess blasts in transformation (n = 136) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included total body irradiation in 199 (44%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow was T-cell depleted for 58 (13%) transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment, grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88%-93%), 36% (95% CI, 31%-40%), and 39% (95% CI, 33%-44%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three-year transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI, 32%-42%), 23% (95% CI, 19%-27%), 40% (95% CI, 36%-45%), and 42% (95% CI, 37%-47%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that young age and platelet counts higher than 100 x 10(9)/L at transplantation were associated with lower TRM and higher disease-free and overall survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relapse incidence was higher in patients with high percentages of blasts in the marrow at transplantation or presentation, with high International Prognostic Scoring System scores at diagnosis, and with T-cell-depleted transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling offers the possibility of long-term, disease-free survival to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Best candidates are younger patients with a low percentage of blasts and preserved platelet counts </plain></SENT>
