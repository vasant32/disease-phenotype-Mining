<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to investigate the value of activated plasma clotting time (APCT) for estimating the efficacy of platelet transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e>, who received transfusion of platelet, involved in the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APCT was determined before and after transfusion of these patients, then APCT was contrasted with corresponding CCI and PPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APCT before transfusion was (103.7 +/- 11.3) seconds, but the 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened to (60.0 +/- 9.7) seconds and (68.5 +/- 9.8) seconds respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the judging criteria of CCI and PPR (CCI and PPR values at 1 and 24 hours after transfusion are &lt; 7500, &lt; 5000 and &lt; 30%, &lt; 20% respectively, the transfusion is invalid), two patients received invalid transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their 1 and 24 hour CCIs were 7415, 2966 and 6913, 4988 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their 1 and 24 hour PPRs were 28.0%, 11.2% and 25.2%, 14.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient's PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but his CCI showed a valid transfusion he received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients' PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but their 1 hour CCI reached the standard of valid transfusion, and their 24 hour CCI reached the standard of invalid transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that APCT reflects the variations of quantity and quality of platelet simultaneously, and can evaluate precisely the efficacy of platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
