<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied telomere length in the bone marrow cells or the granulocyte and lymphocyte cell fractions of 54 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by Southern blot hybridization using the (TTAGGG)4 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average telomere length expressed as the peak telomere repeat array (TRA) in the peripheral blood, or bone marrow samples obtained from a group of 21 healthy age-matched controls (26-89 years old, mean age 55), ranged between 7.5 and 9.5 kb (mean peak TRA 8.6 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) were studied; 10/24 (42%) had telomere reduction (&lt;7.5 kb) relative to age-matched controls and the mean peak TRA was 7.5 kb (range 4.0-9.0 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) were studied; 5/11 (45%) had reduced telomeres relative to age-matched controls and the mean peak TRA was 7.1 kb (range 5.0-9.0 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, comprising 15 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt) and 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in transformation (CMMLt), were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of eighteen patients (72%) had telomere reduction relative to age-matched controls and the mean peak TRA was 6.1 kb (range 3.5-9.0 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients included in the study had either a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or a simple karyotype (1 karyotypic change) and 20/36 (55%) of these had telomere reduction and the mean peak TRA was 7.1 kb (range 4.3-9.0 kb); 8 patients had a complex karyotype (3 or more karyotypic changes) and 5/8 (62%) of these had telomere reduction and the mean peak TRA was 6.1 kb (range 3.5-9.0 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude, firstly that there is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of telomere length in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that this is observed throughout the spectrum of FAB-subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, these data show that a marked reduction in telomere length in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> if often associated with leukemic transformation and with the presence of complex karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
