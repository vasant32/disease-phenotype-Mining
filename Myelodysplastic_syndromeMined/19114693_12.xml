<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-phospholipase C beta1 (PI-PLCbeta1) mono-allelic deletion with the clinical outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta4, and PI-PLCgamma1 cytogenetic investigations were performed on 80 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (18 low risk, 26 intermediate 1, 18 intermediate 2, 18 high risk) comparing the results with the clinical outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization results were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, PI-PLCbeta1 gene and protein expression were assessed by both real-time PCR and immunocytochemical experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Collectively, 35 (43.75%) of 80 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed a specific mono-allelic deletion of PI-PLCbeta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant association (P &lt; .0001) between the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion and a higher risk of evolution into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), since 23 of 35 MDS patients (65.7%) bearing the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion evolved into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even in multivariate analysis, the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion retained a higher significance, with a P &lt; .001, as a prognostic factor of evolution into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% CI, 2.26 to 17.24; P = .00045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, PI-PLCbeta1 deletion was related to an altered gene and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion is associated with a worse clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, hinting at the identification of a new group at higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution and representing a reliable prognostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, targeting PI-PLCbeta1 pathways might emerge as a new therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
