<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> presented in HLA molecules, the so-called minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA), play a crucial role in antitumor immunity as targets for alloreactive donor T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of multiple MiHAs is essential to understand and manipulate the development of clinical responses after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, CD8+ T-cell clones were isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients who entered complete remission after allo-SCT, and MiHA-specific T-cell clones were efficiently selected for analysis of recognition of a panel of EBV-transformed B cells positive for the HLA restriction elements of the selected T-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were determined in the panel cell lines and investigated for matching with the T-cell recognition data by whole genome association scanning (WGAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant association with 12 genomic regions was found, and detailed analysis of genes located within these genomic regions revealed SNP disparities encoding polymorphic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential recognition of patient-type, but not donor-type, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> validated the identification of these MiHAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using tetramers, distinct populations of MiHA-specific CD8+ T cells were detected, demonstrating that our WGAs strategy allows high-throughput discovery of relevant targets in antitumor immunity after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
