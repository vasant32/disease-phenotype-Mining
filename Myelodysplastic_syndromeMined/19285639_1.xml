<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) as first-line therapy mostly in combination with other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between November 2001 and March 2008, 86 patients with cGVHD after allo-HSCT received low-dose MTX therapy until a complete or partial response (CR, PR) was achieved, or until treatment failure or intolerable side effects were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time from HSCT to the start of MTX was 154 (range: 80-993) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number of MTX administrations was 4 (range: 2-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled patients was 83% (71 of 86 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate for GVHD involving various organs was 90% (45 of 50) in the skin, 75% (39 of 52) in the liver, 42% (5 of 12) in the mouth, 3 of 7 in the eye, and 2 of 2 in the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MTX treatment allowed for a significant reduction in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dosage (median 90%) from 20 (2.5-100) mg at the start of MTX administration to 5 (0-30) mg 1 month after MTX was last used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant factor related to higher CR rate was sole organ involvement (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 toxicities occurred in only 3 patients presenting cytopenias or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this analysis, MTX appears to be a well-tolerated, effective, and inexpensive agent when used as a first-line treatment in combination with other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> for cGVHD, especially for skin or sole organ involvement without concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
