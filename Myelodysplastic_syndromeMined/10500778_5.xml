<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We designed a randomized trial of IC with or without <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi>, an agent capable of reverting the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype, in patients aged &lt; or = 65 years with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 12 mg/m2/d d2-5 + AraC 1 g/m2/12 h d1-5, with (Q+) or without (Q-) <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>131 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PGP expression analysis was successfully made in 91 patients and 42 patients (46%) had positive PGP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PGP positive cases, 13 of the 25 (52%) patients who received <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> achieved CR, as compared to 3 of the 17 (18%) patients treated with chemotherapy alone (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In PGP negative cases, the CR rate was 35% and 49%, respectively in patients who received <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> or chemotherapy alone (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 42 PGP positive patients, median Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival was 13 months in patients allocated to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52903">quinine group</z:chebi>, and 8 months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PGP negative patients, median KM survival was 14 months in patients allocated to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52903">quinine group</z:chebi>, and 14 months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> mainly included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> that generally disappeared with dose reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mucositis was significantly more frequently observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52903">quinine group</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No life threatening cardiac toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, results of this randomized study show that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> increases the CR rate and survival in PGP positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases treated with IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> had no effect on the response rate and survival of PGP negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suggests a specific effect on PGP mediated drug resistance rather than, for instance, a simple effect on the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and/or AraC </plain></SENT>
