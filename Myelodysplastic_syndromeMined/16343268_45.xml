<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, four genes implicated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were examined for promoter CpG island hypermethylation in cells from 37 patients with different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest rate of methylation was found for p15INK4B (51%), followed by HIC1 (32%), CDH1 (27%), and ER (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrent hypermethylation of &gt; or = 3 genes was more frequent in advanced compared with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; or = 0.05), and hypermethylation of p15INK4B was associated with leukemic transformation in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 17 months for cases showing hypermethylation of &gt; or = 1 genes vs. 67 months for cases without hypermethylation (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, promoter hypermethylation identified a subgroup of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a particularly poor prognosis (median overall survival 20 months vs. 102 months; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis including stage and thrombocyte count, hypermethylation of &gt; or = 1 genes was an independent negative prognostic factor (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that hypermethylation of p15INK4B, HIC1, CDH1, and ER contribute to the development and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
