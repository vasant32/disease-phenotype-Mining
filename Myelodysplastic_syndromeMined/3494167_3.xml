<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls, prepared with or without phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), were assayed for their capacity to stimulate the in-vitro formation of multilineage colonies (CFU-GEMM) in target marrow cell cultures of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both PHA-induced DNA synthesis and T-cell subpopulation ratios (T4/T8) in patient cells were significantly lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no impaired production of pluripotent progenitor cell colony stimulating activity (CFU-GEMMCSA) by PHA-stimulated and unstimulated PBMNC, could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> levels of activity were also produced by isolated T lymphocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autologous serum neither enhanced nor suppressed the production of CFU-GEMMCSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate that PHA-induced production of CFU-GEMMCSA is not directly correlated with DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have found that both major T-cell subsets, defined by OKT4 and OKT8 monoclonal antibodies, are equally capable of producing CFU-GEMMCSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> production of CFU-GEMMCSA by T cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients suggests that this T-cell function is not an etiological factor in the stem cell disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
