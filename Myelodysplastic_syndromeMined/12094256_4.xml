<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a new protocol whereby we achieved a highly efficient lentiviral transduction of erythroid precursor cells originating from the bone marrow of healthy adults and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) stem cells from healthy subjects were cultured with erythropoietin, IL-3 and stem cell factor, and thereby expanded approximately 300-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When these cultures were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing GFP as a reporter gene, 70% glycophorin(+) cells were GFP(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although proliferation and levels of transduction were reduced in cultures of CD34(+) stem cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 50% of glycophorin(+) cells became GFP(+), amongst which 30% were sideroblastic erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that lentiviral vectors are capable of efficiently transducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> precursors and offers new perspectives to investigate the influence of specific genes on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may eventually help to correct defects in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
