<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here present the case of a 64-year-old female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, who received peripheral blood stem cells from her HLA-identical brother after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two months after allogeneic transplantation she suffered from a relapse, now fulfilling WHO criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a bone marrow blast count of 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then decided to treat her with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with proven antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved a complete haematological response after two cycles and full donor chimerism after a single dose of donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> acts through a direct reduction of malignant cells and may in addition augment the immunologic effects of donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
