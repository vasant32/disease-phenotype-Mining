<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the period 1.4.1988-1.3.1991, these patients were treated with erythropoietin (Epo), the granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or the granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had primary bone-marrow insufficiency: six had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, three had primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026764" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myelomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On account of dominating symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, five patients received Epo while eight received GM-CSF as part of an extensive clinical trial of this preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with relapse of the haematological malignant disease had bone-marrow insufficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> secondary to intensive chemotherapy/irradiation: four of these patients received GM-CSF and two received G-CSF with the object of increasing bone-marrow regeneration and to render further chemotherapy possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient received GM-CSF with the object of improving bone-marrow function after autologous bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Epo for ten months combined with treatment with interferon for six months resulted in normalization of the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in one patient with bone-marrow insufficiency on account of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Epo for briefer periods in lower doses was without effect in four other patients with primary bone-marrow insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GM-CSF and G-CSF resulted in neutrophil <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> in 12 out of 15 patients (80%) and, in six out of 14 patients (43%), increased marrow cellularity was demonstrated by means of histological examination of the bone-marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels during treatment with GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
