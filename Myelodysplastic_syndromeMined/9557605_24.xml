<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall mean percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was about 17% in the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while bone marrow from control cases exhibited a mean of 3.4% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in bone marrow cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the expression of Fas antigen and Fas ligand (FasL) was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases showed expression of Fas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (12/12) and most exhibited an expression of FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (10/12) by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basically, control cases did not show positive signals for Fas and FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, however, a very weak band was detected in three cases (3/10) for Fas and in one case (1/10) for FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for Fas (11/12) and FasL (12/12) in the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the bone marrow samples from control cases were negative for anti-Fas (0/15) and for anti-FasL (0/15) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double staining clarified that TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells expressed Fas antigen on the cell surface, although not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Fas-positive cells were TUNEL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Fas-positive cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow included hematopoietic cells expressing CD34 antigen, neutrophil elastase, a marker for myeloid series of cells, or glycophorin A, a marker for erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CD68-positive cells which were macrophage lineage cells, did not express Fas antigen strongly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, positive staining for FasL was detected in hematopoietic cells and CD68-positive cells in the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Fas-FasL system plays an important role in inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and works in an autocrine (hematopoietic cell-hematopoietic cell interaction) and/or paracrine (hematopoietic cell-stromal cell interaction) manner </plain></SENT>
