<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from 20 laboratories were combined to get an impression of the true frequency of clonal divisions for comparison with the theoretical models that have been previously used to set laboratory policies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed that low-percentage clones were more common in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and that high-percentage clones were more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), although the clone detection rate in ALLs is higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inference is that the putative diagnosis should be taken into account when deciding how many divisions to analyze before concluding that no detectable clone is present </plain></SENT>
