<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and a platelet count greater than 80 x 10(9)/L were the subjects of a study of platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A whole-blood platelet lumi-aggregometer was used for simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation by the impedance method and of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>-dense granule release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and episodes of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had at least 1 abnormal result indicating platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp>; 7 patients had mixed platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>; and 4 patients had platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> and prolonged skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (P = .005); however, several patients with platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding suggested that whole-blood platelet aggregation studies may be more sensitive than <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time in identification of patients at risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was frequent (32 patients) in this cohort despite platelet counts greater than 100 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding indicated platelet hypofunction was clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 2 of the 13 patients with thrombotic events had evidence of platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, suggesting that other clinical factors are probably more important determinants of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations confirm that platelet dysfunction is common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and suggest a useful role for routine whole-blood platelet aggregation studies to identify patients at risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
