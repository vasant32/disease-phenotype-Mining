<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Response rates remain low, and mechanism-based dose optimization has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clinical and pharmacodynamic results of different dose schedules of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adults with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) were randomized to 1 of 3 decitabine schedules: (1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days; (2) 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for 5 days; and (3) 10 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Randomization followed a Bayesian adaptive design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five patients were treated (77 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 18 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 32 patients (34%) achieved a complete response (CR), and 69 (73%) had an objective response by the new modified International Working Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-day intravenous schedule, which had the highest dose-intensity, was selected as optimal; the CR rate in that arm was 39%, compared with 21% in the 5-day subcutaneous arm and 24% in the 10-day intravenous arm (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high dose-intensity arm was also superior at inducing hypomethylation at day 5 and at activating P15 expression at days 12 or 28 after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a low-dose, dose-intensity schedule of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> optimizes epigenetic modulation and clinical responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
