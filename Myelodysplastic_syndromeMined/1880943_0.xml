<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity may also differ with bone marrow site in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We chose 32 cases with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> and examined their bone marrow histologically at two different sites (sternum and posterior iliac crest) at almost the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the histological differences in 5 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 2 cases of myeloproliferative syndrome and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the iliac marrow was slightly hypoplastic compared with sternal marrow but there were no differences in the components of hematopoietic cells, that were thought to reflect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic activity for their respective ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 among 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, nodular hyperplastic areas were observed in sternal marrow even though iliac marrow was severely hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a nodular hyperplastic area is useful for differential diagnosis between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, because such a histological change was not observed in the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In myeloproliferative syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, there were no differences between sternal and iliac marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were hyperplastic and had almost the same hematopoietic components </plain></SENT>
