<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the admission, the white cell count was 30,900/microliter with blasts (14.0%) and marked basophilia (49.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> revealed with 30.2% blasts and 21.1% basophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Having obtained those results, diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation was made </plain></SENT>
