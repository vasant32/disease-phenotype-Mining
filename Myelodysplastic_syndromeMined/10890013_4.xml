<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation-specific probes are synthesized for each possible single-base, nonsilent mutation in codons 12, 13, and 61 of H-, K-, and N-ras oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations are identified by competitive oligonucleotide probe ligation to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and/or mutant genotypes in one reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three probes (one common and two allelic probes) are needed for analysis of each mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probes hybridized to target ras oncogene DNA are joined by a thermostable ligase if there are no mismatches at their junctions; temperature cycling results in a linear increase in product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Common probes are labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51217">fluorochromes</z:chebi>, and allelic probes each have different lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ligation products are analyzed by denaturing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis on a fluorescent DNA sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have applied this technology to identify ras mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancers</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
