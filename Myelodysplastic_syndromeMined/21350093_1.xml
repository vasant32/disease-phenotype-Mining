<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 10 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in hematologic and cytogenetic remission with del(20q) detected by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 6 men and 4 women with a median age of 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients initially had BCR-ABL1 and t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) and achieved morphologic and cytogenetic remission after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>del(20q) was identified before (2/10 [20%]), at the time of (3/10 [30%]), or after (5/10 [50%]) cytogenetic remission and was not associated with morphologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, no patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte and platelet counts were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; 4 of 10 patients had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients have remained in morphologic and cytogenetic remission with stable del(20q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript levels were absent or low (median, 0.01%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, in 1 patient, recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> developed and del(20q) was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that del(20q) in the setting of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in remission is not predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or blast transformation </plain></SENT>
