<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines short-term outcomes using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pathology records were searched for adults (age, &gt;18) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> treated at our musculoskeletal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment involved surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subtypes were pleomorphic (7), alveolar (1), embryonal (1), and mixed alveolar/embryonal (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 7 patients with nonmetastatic disease, 6 had no evidence of disease posttreatment, but 1 died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after 51 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had 100% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with positive margins scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy had local recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> within 2 weeks and died 5 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> on presentation, 1 had complete response, 2 had partial response with later progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 8 and 24 months, and 1 had immediate progression and died at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean overall survival was 24 months with 6 of 11 (55%) alive at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean disease-free survival was 17 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 23 months for the 7 patients who had remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When combined with surgery and radiation therapy, chemotherapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> yielded 55% overall and 64% disease-free survival at 2 years </plain></SENT>
