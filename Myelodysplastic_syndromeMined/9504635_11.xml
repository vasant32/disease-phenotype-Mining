<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are described to be characteristic of secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, especially after prior mutagenic exposure, and to be associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our series of 59 patients with 12p abnormalities and ANLL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> was proven only in five patients, but in 13/44 patients ANLL evolved from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a small deletion del(12)(p11.2p13) having a mild clinical course were distinguished from those with a large del(12)(p11.2), additional chromosomal anomalies, and a poor clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 31 patients with translocations or dicentric chromosomes involving 12p, a group of eight with t/dic(12;13) was the most frequent and was associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was adverse in the majority of patients with complex karyotype abnormalities, but in some patients a milder clinical course seems likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new, hitherto undescribed, abnormality in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> case with a duplication dup(12)(p11.2p13) was the amplification of the signal of the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone 964c10 (D12S736) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 38 cases with deletions or unbalanced translocations/dicentrics one YAC signal was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients with balanced translocations demonstrated breakpoints within the YAC, containing the ETV6 (<z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints were telomeric to the YAC 964c10 in seven cases and centromeric in one patient </plain></SENT>
