<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically useful arrays are designed with specific purposes in mind and with attention to genomic content and probe density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> array types have been shown to detect genomic copy gains and losses, with SNP arrays having the added advantage of detecting copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The finding of CNLOH has led to the identification of certain disease genes implicated in the initiation or progression of myeloid diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, SNP karyotyping alone, or in conjunction with routine cytogenetics, can affect the outcome prediction and improve prognostic stratification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who were reclassified after array testing as having adverse-risk chromosomal findings correlated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of over 25 published studies support the use of arrays in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because few balanced translocations are found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, this disease is particularly amenable to microarray testing, and studies have shown better disease classification, identification of cryptic changes, and prognostication in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel genomic alterations identified by array testing may lead to better targeted therapies for treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
