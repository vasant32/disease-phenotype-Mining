<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide has dramatic therapeutic effects in patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a chromosome 5q31 deletion, resulting in complete cytogenetic remission in &gt;60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of this remarkable drug response is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the molecular targets of lenalidomide we investigated its in vitro effects on growth, maturation, and global gene expression in isolated erythroblast cultures from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with del(5)(q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide inhibited growth of differentiating del(5q) erythroblasts but did not affect cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lenalidomide significantly influenced the pattern of gene expression in del(5q) intermediate erythroblasts, with the VSIG4, PPIC, TPBG, activin A, and SPARC genes up-regulated by &gt;2-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples and many genes involved in erythropoiesis, including HBA2, GYPA, and KLF1, down-regulated in most samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activin A, one of the most significant differentially expressed genes between lenalidomide-treated cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls, has pleiotropic functions, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation and increased protein expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene SPARC is of particular interest because it is antiproliferative, antiadhesive, and antiangiogenic and is located at 5q31-q32, within the commonly deleted region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lenalidomide inhibits growth of del(5q) erythroid progenitors and that the up-regulation of SPARC and activin A may underlie the potent effects of lenalidomide in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5)(q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPARC may play a role in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
