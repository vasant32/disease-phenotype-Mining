<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15(ink4B) (p15) is frequently decreased because of the aberrant methylation of the gene promoter; p15 is normally up-regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that p15 methylation and deregulation of gene expression contribute to defective megakaryocytopoiesis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here it is shown that the increasing autocrine production of TGF-beta1 stimulates megakaryocytic differentiation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34(+) cells and that p15 mediates, at least in part, this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This TGF-beta1-dependent pathway is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) progenitors because of p15 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demethylating agent 2-deoxyAZAcytidin can restore the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> demethylated state of the p15 gene and increase its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells only poorly differentiate to the megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that p15 methylation occurs in a neoplastic clone with a profound defect of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation that cannot be overcome by using a demethylating drug </plain></SENT>
