<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five female patients were included in this study; two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and three with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were heterozygous for BstXI restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the X-chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient, erythroid and nonerythroid colonies, grown in the presence of erythropoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), exhibited no remarkable difference in clonal constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed only one methylation pattern, suggesting the monoclonal origin of hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonies of two other patients exhibited predominant and minor methylation patterns in PGK gene, indicating that nonclonal progenitor cells remain a minor population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow of one patient appeared to contain a greater proportion of nonclonal progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF), a potent colony-stimulating factor, enhanced both erythroid and nonerythroid colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it did not notably alter the clonal constitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that nonclonal hematopoietic progenitor cells can persist in a substantial number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
