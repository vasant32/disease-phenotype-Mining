<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DFS was 65.7% for patients in RA or CR at HSCT compared with 0% for patients with &gt;5% residual marrow blasts (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine patients died; the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 4) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD; n = 2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
