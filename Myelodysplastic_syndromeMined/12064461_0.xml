<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established a new hematopoietic cell line from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), which was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line, designated TER-3, depends on several cytokines for long-term survival and growth, and requires interleukin-3 (IL-3) for continuous growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical analysis revealed that TER-3 cells are weakly dianisidine positive and nonspecific esterase positive, but peroxidase negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surface marker profile shows that the TER-3 cells are strongly positive for myeloid, lymphoid, and megakaryocytic antigens such as CD15, CD19, and CD61, and negative for some common multilineage antigens such as CD13, CD33, and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, this cell line has a multilineage phenotype, suggesting that the transformation event occurred in multipotent stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dianisidine- and nonspecific esterase-positive TER-3 cells increase with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) rather than with IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the cell line is useful for understanding the mechanism underlying G-CSF-associated hematopoietic cell differentiation and activation in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
