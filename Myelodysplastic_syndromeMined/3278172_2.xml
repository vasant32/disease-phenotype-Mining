<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ras gene activation sufficient to mediate in vitro transformation and rodent <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> usually results from point mutations and amino acid substitutions in the 12th or 61st codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and the related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, amino acid substitution at the 13th codon has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An activated c-N-ras gene from a 45-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was isolated by transfection analysis and subjected to molecular cloning and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A point mutation of the 12th codon (GGT to GAT) resulting in aspartic acid substitution for glycine was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, specific ras mutations occur predominantly (e.g., K-ras, codon 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This predominance has been of demonstrable value in analyzing large cohorts for ras activation with techniques that are rapid and economical, such as oligonucleotide hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It had previously been thought that such a predominance for activation of c-N-ras at codon 13 existed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; however, this study in concert with others underscores the importance of 12th codon c-N-ras mutations, along with 13th and 61st codon mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Guanylate to adenylate transition mutations are commonly observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and may provide insight into potential environmental leukemogens </plain></SENT>
