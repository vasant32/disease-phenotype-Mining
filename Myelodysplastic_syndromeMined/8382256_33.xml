<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because human lymphotoxin (LT) was originally isolated from a lymphoblastoid cell line, we investigated the role of this molecule in three newly established Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected human B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lines were derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (Z-6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (Z-43), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (Z-55) patients who had a prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each lymphoblastoid cell line had a karyotype that was different from that of the original parent leukemic cells, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed B cell, but not T cell or myeloid surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lines, rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region (JH) bands were found, and the presence of EBV DNA was confirmed by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Z-6, Z-43, and Z-55 cell lines constitutively produced 192, 48, and 78 U/ml LT, respectively, as assessed by a cytotoxicity assay and antibody neutralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) were undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines expressed high-affinity TNF/LT receptors with receptor densities of 4197, 1258, and 1209 sites/cell on Z-6, Z-43, and Z-55, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, labeled TNF binding could be reversed by both unlabeled TNF, as well as by LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies with p60 and p80 receptor-specific antibodies revealed that the three lines expressed primarily the p80 form of the TNF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When studied in a clonogenic assay, exogenous LT stimulated proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with [3H]TdR incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal anti-LT neutralizing antibodies at concentrations of 25-500 U/ml inhibited cellular multiplication in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that in spite of a common receptor, TNF (1,000 U/ml) had no direct effect on Z-55 cell growth, whereas it partially reversed the stimulatory effect of exogenous LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, TNF inhibited Z-6 and Z-43 cell proliferation, and its suppressive effect was reversed by exogenous LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both p80 and p60 forms of soluble TNF receptors suppressed the lymphoblastoid cell line proliferation and their inhibitory effect was partially reversed by LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that (a) LT is an autocrine growth factor for EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines; and (b) anti-LT antibodies, soluble TNF/LT receptors, and TNF itself can suppress the growth of lymphoblastoid cells, probably by modulating or competing with LT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
