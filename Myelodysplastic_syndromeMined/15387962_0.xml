<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the gene expression profiles of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and try to identify some genes with pathogenetic and diagnostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 1 case of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (RTC), 4 cases of RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt), were isolated and the total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted and underwent transcriptome analysis by using customized cDNA microarray with 500 gene clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen specimens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, as controls, were collected from the ribs of 17 patients with chest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cluster software was used to make analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out to confirm the results of microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 95 genes, such as the genes of thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), MAX dimerization protein (MAD), DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1), were shown to be abnormally expressed in at least 5 MDS patients compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, involving cell growth and differentiation regulation, cell cycle control, signaling, and redox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 10 MDS patients in different stages were clustered into two distinct groups, whereas a case with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and other RA patients were clustered into two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed the identical results in 3 (60%) of the 5 genes determined by microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analysis on samples from 50 MDS patients confirmed the different expression levels of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> helicase-related protein (RNAHP), GSPT1, and DDIT3 between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technology of microarray can reveal the intrinsic molecular features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the detection of DDIT3 and RNAHP expression may be useful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
