<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent identification of acquired mutations in key components of the spliceosome machinery strongly implicates abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, questions remain as to how these aberrations functionally combine with the growing list of mutations in genes involved in epigenetic modification and cell signalling/transcription regulation identified in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, amplicon sequencing was used to perform a mutation screen in 154 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients using a 22-gene panel, including commonly mutated spliceosome components (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35A, ZRSR2), and a further 18 genes known to be mutated in myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of 22-gene panel revealed that 76% (n=117) of the patients had mutations in at least one of the genes, with 38% (n=59) having splicing gene mutations and 49% (n=75) patients harbouring more than one gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, single and specific epigenetic modifier mutations tended to coexist with SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations (p&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mutations in SF3B1 and SRSF2 were mutually exclusive to TP53 mutations both at diagnosis and time of disease transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mutations in FLT3, NRAS, RUNX1, CCBL and C-KIT were more likely to co-occur with splicing factor mutations generally (p&lt;0.02), particularly in SRSF2 mutants (p&lt;0.003) and were significantly associated with disease transformation (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with SF3B1 and TP53 mutations had varying impacts on overall survival with hazard ratios of 0.2 (p&lt;0.03, 95% CI, 0.1-0.8) and 2.1 (p&lt;0.04, 95% CI, 1.1-4.4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with splicing factor mutations alone had a better overall survival than those with epigenetic modifier mutations, or cell signalling/transcription regulator mutations with and without coexisting mutations of splicing factor genes, with worsening prognosis (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that splicing factor mutations are maintained throughout disease evolution with emerging oncogenic mutations adversely impacting on patient outcome, implicating spliceosome mutations as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
