<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of these drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, have received FDA approval for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, phase 2 and 3 studies that assessed these agents in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> included only a small number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> at our institution were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was administered at 75 mg/m(2) /day for 7 days or 100 mg/m(2) /day for 5 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who received at least 1 cycle of the drug were considered evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response was assessed by the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 39% (14 of 36); complete response (CR) rate was 11% (4 of 36); partial response (PR) rate was 3% (1 of 36); hematologic improvement (HI) was 25% (9 of 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant overall survival advantage in responders compared with nonresponders: 15.5 months versus 9 months, respectively (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of 2 patients had complete resolution of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> that was due to monocytic infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> is active in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The therapy-associated toxicity is acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results support further investigation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, particularly in combination with other agents </plain></SENT>
