<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four-year results are presented on 2086 participants of a medical surveillance program of current and retired employees at a manufacturing complex in Illinois </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Annual complete blood cell count testing and intensive follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> out-of-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-range results began in 1985 on a voluntary basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The program to date has not identified any evidence for an unusual distribution of out-of-range complete blood cell count results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active employees with out-of-range complete blood cell count values had no increase in adverse health outcomes compared with those with in-range values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retired employees with out-of-range values were more likely to have a serious underlying medical condition, but this appeared to be more a function of age than of occupational exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were brought to our attention as a result of the program, but there is no similarly followed population available for comparison to determine whether this represents an increase over expected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation of out-of-range complete blood cell count results in active employees with serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> raises significant questions about the utility of such surveillance for chemically exposed groups (eg, <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-exposed workers) when exposure levels are low and well controlled </plain></SENT>
