<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 (+11) occurring as a sole abnormality is the third most common <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the ALL1 gene, located at 11q23, can be rearranged as a result of a partial tandem duplication in two such cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is the recurrent molecular defect in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> presenting with +11 as a sole cytogenic abnormality, we performed Southern analysis and PCR for defects of ALL1 in 17 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with +11 or +11q but without cytogenic evidence of a structural abnormality involving 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases (67%) had rearrangement of ALL1, including 10 of 11 patients (91%) with +11 as a sole abnormality and 2 of 7 cases (29%) with +11 and other aberrations; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026998" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M1</z:e> or M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the 12 cases, material was available for additional characterization; a partial tandem duplication of ALL1 was detected in each of these 10 cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four cases demonstrated previously unreported duplications, two of which were detectable only by reverse transcription-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients with the ALL1 duplication also displayed a loss of material from 7q, suggesting an association between these two findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is present in most, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with +11 as a sole abnormality, and can be found in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with +11 or +11q accompanied by other cytogenic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duplication is more prevalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than was recognized previously in part because its size and location vary considerably, requiring a variety of molecular probes for detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our finding of the ALL1 duplication as a consistent defect in patients with +11 represents the first identification of a specific gene rearrangement associated with recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
