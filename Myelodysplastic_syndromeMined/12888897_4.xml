<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4: VK2) has been reported to show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation-inducing effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clinical benefits of using VK2 have been demonstrated for the treatment of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the in vitro effects of VK2 on <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines LU-139 and LU-130 for small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, PC-14 and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>-185 for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, LC-AI and LC-1/sq for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, and IA-LM for large cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with VK2 for 48 to 96 h resulted in cell growth suppression in a dose-dependent manner in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) for VK2 ranged from 7.5 to 75 micro M, and there was no relation between the efficacy of growth suppression by VK2 and tissue type of <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologic features of the cells treated with VK2 were typical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> along with caspase-3 activation and becoming positive for APO2.7 monoclonal antibody, an antibody which specifically detects the cell undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line, LU-139 cells accumulated into G0/G1 phase during 72-h exposure to VK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> plus VK2 resulted in enhanced cytocidal effect compared to the cells treated with either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or VK2 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since VK2 is a safe medicine without prominent adverse effects including bone marrow suppression, our data strongly suggest the therapeutic possibility of using VK2 for the treatment of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
