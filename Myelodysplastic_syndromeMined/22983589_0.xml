<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, classified by updated criteria, in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 58,800 cases incident between 1995 to 2002 in 48 population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries from 20 European countries, classified into HAEMACARE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> groupings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The period approach was used to estimate 5-year relative survival in 2000-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative overall survival rate was 37%, but varied significantly between the major groups: being 17% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 20% for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 31% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 63% for myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients with individual disease entities ranged from 90% for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> to 4% for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional European variations in survival were conspicuous for myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, with survival rates being lowest in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first paper to present large-scale, European survival data for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> using prognosis-based groupings of entities defined by the third revision of the International Classification of Diseases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>/World Health Organization classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor survival in some parts of Europe, particularly for treatable diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, is of concern for hematologists and public health authorities </plain></SENT>
