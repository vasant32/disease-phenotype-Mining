<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to VK2 monotherapy (45mg/day) after 16 weeks was 13% (5/38) including 4 cases with improvement of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and 1 case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then enrolled and evaluated 20 out of 33 VK2-monotherapy non-responders for VK2 plus VD3 (0.75microg/day) combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate at 16 weeks after initiation of VK2 plus VD3 was 30% (6/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HI for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) was observed in 6 out of 11 patients (55%) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 3 out of 11 patients (27%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No HI was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in VK2 monotherapy and VK2 plus VD3 combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that IPSS scores and absolute neutrophil counts positively correlated, and Hb levels inversely correlated with the response to VK2 plus VD3 combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that VK2 plus VD3 combination therapy appears to be promising for improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> with low/intermediate-1 MDS </plain></SENT>
