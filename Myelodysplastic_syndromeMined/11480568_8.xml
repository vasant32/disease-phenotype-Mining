<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), consecutively diagnosed from 1986 to 1999, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,856 patients from 1 to 15 years of age and 1,803 patients from 15 to 29 years of age were eligible for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographically, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> found was almost constant during the teenage years, whereas the frequency of ALL gradually decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> apparently started to increase in patients in their late teens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of M3 and t(15;17) gradually increased during adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients aged 1 to 4 years, M7 was the most frequent FAB subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients aged 5 to 9 years, M2 and t(8;21) was the most frequent subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of T cell ALL increased in patients 5 to 9 years old, reaching 31.2% in the 20- to 24-year-old age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with hyperdiploidy over 50 chromosomes was highest (17.0%) in patients aged 1 to 4 and decreased to 3.9% in the older teens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with the Ph1 chromosome increased from 9.9% in teens to 30.0% in patients in their late twenties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When comparing event-free survival (EFS) rates for ALL according to age, the estimated 7-year EFS rate was highest for patients aged 1 to 9 years (65.9%) and intermediate for patients aged 10 to 15 years (48.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the EFS rate was significantly worse for patients aged 15 to 19 years (19.4%) and 20 to 29 years (17.0%) (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the EFS rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> decreased with increasing age, although without statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates are approximate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results of the study indicate that there are considerable variations in biologic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> between children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may be improved by introducing pediatric trials, which take into account the prognostic biological features </plain></SENT>
