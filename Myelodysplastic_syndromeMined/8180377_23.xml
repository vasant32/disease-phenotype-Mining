<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are associated with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and, in particular, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Together with deletions of chromosome 5q and chromosome 7q, chromosome 20q deletions have previously been thought to be restricted to myeloid cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that deletion of chromosome 20q in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can arise in a multipotent precursor of both myeloid cells and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell lines, both with and without a 20q deletion, have been isolated from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these cell lines have been shown to provide a useful physical mapping tool and have been used to confirm the interstitial nature of the 20q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR analysis of PGK gene methylation have been used to study highly purified populations of peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 20q deletion was detectable by microsatellite PCR in peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes but not in B cells or T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clonality of the different lineages followed the same pattern as the 20q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This represents the first report in which a chromosome abnormality associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has been immortalized in an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data show that patients with apparent myeloid restriction of a chromosome deletion may in fact have a disease arising in a multipotent cell with both myeloid and lymphoid potential </plain></SENT>
