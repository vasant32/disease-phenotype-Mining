<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 52 MDS patients (mean age 79 years, range 68 to 96) from the time of initial diagnosis to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 8/52 patients (15%) at initial diagnosis: 1/26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 0/4 with RA with ringed sideroblasts, 3/11 with RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 3/8 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, and 1/3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 mutations were detected in 3/8 (38%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IHC-positive patients had a significantly higher incidence of leukemic transformation and the presence of a complex karyotype with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IHC-positive cells included blasts as well as mature myeloid cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scrutiny of our data in combination with previous data revealed that patients with positive IHC in multilineage cells were older than those in whom positivity was noted mostly in myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that p53 IHC positivity with a multilineage pattern may be a characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in older patients </plain></SENT>
