<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) commonly have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>elevated serum ferritin</z:hpo> prior to HSCT, which has been associated with increased mortality after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has led to the suggestion that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> is common and deleterious in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between serum ferritin and parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in such patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a prospective study of 48 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) undergoing myeloablative HSCT, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate liver iron content (LIC) and cardiac iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median (and range) pre-HSCT value of serum ferritin was 1549 ng/mL (20-6989); serum hepcidin, 59 ng/mL (10-468); labile plasma iron, 0 LPI units (0.0-0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of patients had hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29231">HIO</z:chebi>), and 42% had significant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29231">HIO</z:chebi> (LIC â‰¥5.0 mg/gdw) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient had cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between pre-HSCT serum ferritin and estimated LIC (r = .75), which was mostly dependent on prior transfusion history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum hepcidin was appropriately elevated in patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29231">HIO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Labile plasma iron elevation was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A regression calibration analysis supported the hypothesis that elevated pre-HSCT LIC is significantly associated with inferior post-HSCT survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results contribute to our understanding of the prevalence, mechanism, and consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in HSCT </plain></SENT>
