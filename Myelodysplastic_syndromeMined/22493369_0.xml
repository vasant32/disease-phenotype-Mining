<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of twenty patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were ineligible for standard-dose Ara-C plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> and received CA as remission-induction therapy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CA consisted of low-dose Ara-C (10 mg/m(2), subcutaneous injection every 12 hours, for 14 days) and aclarubicin (14 mg/m(2) for patients &lt;70 years old and 10 mg/m(2) for patients ≥70 years old in a one-hour infusion for 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used from day 1 of CA to white blood cell count (WBC) recovery, except for patients with initial WBC of more than 20.0×10(3)/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients (55%) achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients whose WBC were ≥20.0×10(3)/mm(3) and did not receive G-CSF were refractory to CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predicted 2-year overall survival rate and median survival duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients were 37.9% and 363 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predicted 1-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) rate and median duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> of 11 patients who achieved complete remission were 30.3% and 332 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one patient died due to transfusion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CA combination with G-CSF as remission-induction therapy is promising and well-tolerated in patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who are ineligible for standard-dose Ara-C plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
