<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-kit has been classified as CD117 and is especially useful in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed 104 consecutive cases (55 AML, 23 B-cell lineage ALL, three T-cell ALL, 11 blast crisis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and 12 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with more than 10% of blasts) referred to our Hospital for immunophenotypic diagnosis and compared the expression pattern of CD13, CD33 and CD117 using the same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> (phycoerythrin-PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recommendations of the EGIL group were followed in order to establish lineage involvement of the blastic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The threshold used to assign positivity for CD117 was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcr/abl, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-1 and MLL rearrangements were assessed by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD117 expression was detected in 91% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the negative cases corresponded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calculated specificity for myeloid involvement was 0.86 for CD117, 0.36 for CD13 and 0.44 for CD33 (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD117 was also positive in four cases of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of these cases showed bcr/abl or MLL rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the light of these findings, CD117 expression should yield a higher score, at least one point, in the system currently applied for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemias</z:hpo> (BAL) as its myeloid specificity is greater than that of CD13 and CD33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its absence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> could identify two subgroups of M5b cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The coexpression of CD117 with cytoplasmic CD79a is often associated with CD7 reactivity, suggesting a stem cell disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD117 should be included on a routine basis for the immunophenotypic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
