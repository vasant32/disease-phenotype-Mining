<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them a deletion of the terminal 5p has recurred in seven previous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wish to report on an additional such patient in order to reinforce the significance of this genomic region in the cause of at least a subgroup of OAV cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Future studies, particularly in the OAV patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100731'>lateral facial cleft</z:hpo>, might define one genetic background of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our patient had a complex translocation chromosome 45,XX, inv(2) (q32q37)mat, dic(5;21) (p15.3;q22.3)dn, resulting in a terminal 5p deletion, a terminal deletion of 21q demonstrated by FISH studies, and a duplication of 21q22.11-q22.12 documented by molecular karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to OAV she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> treated with bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss her clinical findings with reference to her karyotype findings and review the patients with OAV and a terminal deletion of 5p </plain></SENT>
