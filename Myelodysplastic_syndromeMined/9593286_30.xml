<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EU Concerted Action Workshop on 11q23 provided 550 cases for study of which 82 showed abnormalities which did not involve the established translocations or deletion of 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these 'other' cases, which included inversions and duplications, 11q23 was found to be involved with 25 chromosome partners of which 10 had not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were 1q31, 4p11, 6q13, 8q21, 10q22, 10q25, 11q11, 11q21, 13q34 and 18q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated the value of the Workshop, in confirming the diversity of chromosomal partner sites involved with 11q23 and in the identification of new partners </plain></SENT>
