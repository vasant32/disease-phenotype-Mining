<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase 1/2 study of the combination of 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (5-AZA), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA), and ATRA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5-AZA was administered subcutaneously at a fixed dose of 75 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VPA was dose-escalated and given orally daily for 7 days concomitantly with 5-AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATRA was given at 45 mg/m(2) orally daily for 5 days, starting on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 53 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 69 years (range, 5-84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose of VPA in this combination was 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicity was reversible neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In previously untreated older patients, the response rate was 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median number of courses to response was 1 (range, 1-3 courses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median remission duration was 26 weeks, and median survival has not been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in global DNA methylation and induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>VPA blood levels were higher in responders (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination studied is safe and has significant clinical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no </plain></SENT>
