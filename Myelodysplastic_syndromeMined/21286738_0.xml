<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated dysplastic mono-, bi-, and multinuclear MKs (n =���169) of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and one patient with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> by sequential multilocus FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of binuclear MKs with a combined DNA content of 4 N (n = 46) indicated a significantly even (symmetric) chromosome distribution between the two separate nuclei (p = 0.0223), which suggests bipolar spindle orientation and symmetric chromosome segregation during the first endomitotic cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, multinuclear MKs of higher ploidy (&gt;4 N, n = 108) demonstrated a significantly uneven (asymmetric) chromosome distribution between the separate nuclei (p = 0.0248) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the internuclear chromosomal distribution of dysplastic MKs depends on the level of ploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, centrosomal aberrations were not found in dysplastic MKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that megakaryocytic multinucleation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> originates from dysregulated endomitosis, including restoration of karyokinesis </plain></SENT>
