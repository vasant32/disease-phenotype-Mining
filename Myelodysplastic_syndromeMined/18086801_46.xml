<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) reduces nonrelapse mortality (NRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reduction makes it possible for patients who are ineligible for high-dose myeloablative conditioning allo-SCT to benefit from graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this multicenter, prospective study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we investigated the efficacy of RIC allo-SCT from a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling by using a regimen that uses fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 59) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 34) were included, and the median age was of 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for survivors was 43 months (range, 3 to 89 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)) and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (8 to 10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one patient received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyslosporine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 100-day, 1-year, and 4-year incidences of NRM were 8, 16%, and 21%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1- and 4-year relapse cumulative incidences were 23% and 37%, respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> recurrence was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 43% and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 4-year cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 53% (45% extensive), and its development was the major factor associated with lower relapse incidence and improved DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the capacity of this RIC regimen to obtain long-term remissions in patients ineligible for a conventional allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest an important role of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in reducing relapse and improving DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
