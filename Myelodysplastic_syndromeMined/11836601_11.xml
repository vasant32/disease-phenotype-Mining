<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CYP3A5 is a major P450 enzyme in the liver and represents 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A content in people expressing CYP3A5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 that resulted in the absence of CYP3A5 from tissues were noted in some people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of potential relevance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been described for various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow and/or peripheral blood from 188 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients, 101 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 40 MDS, and 270 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were analyzed by a PCR-RFLP assay to evaluate the association of the CYP3A5 polymorphisms with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that 15/188 (8%), 8/101 (7.9%), and 3/40 (7.5%) of the patients (i.e., 188 AML, 101 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 40 MDS) were CYP3A5*1/*1; 88/188 (46.8%), 47/101 (46.5%), and 20/40 (50%) were CYP3A5*1/*3; and 85/188 (45.2%), 46/101 (45.5%), and 17/40 (42.5%) carried the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CYP3A5*6 was not found in any of the patients' specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar frequencies of CYP3A5*3 were observed in the leukemic patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the finding suggests that the CYP3A5 polymorphism was not associated with the risk of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
