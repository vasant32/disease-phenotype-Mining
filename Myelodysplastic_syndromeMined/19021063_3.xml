<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, MSCs have gained further interests after the demonstration of an immunosuppressive role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it's still unclear whether the immunosuppressive capability of MSCs will be altered with disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, our results showed that MSCs derived from patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) capable of suppressing the proliferation of T-lymphocyte stimulated in a mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunosuppressive effect of MSCs derived from ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and NHL on T-cell proliferation was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The supernatants of MSCs derived from ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and NHL had effect on T-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using neutralising monoclonal antibodies, we found that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and hepatocyte growth factor were major mediators of T-cell suppression by MSCs derived from ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although MSCs derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastics syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) could inhibit T-cell proliferation stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> or in MLR, the inhibitory effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSCs was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, adherent cells derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) showed abnormal immunomodulatory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adherent cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> failed to suppress the proliferation of T-cell stimulated in MLR </plain></SENT>
