<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ezatiostat HCl, an agent with the potential for producing multi-lineage responses in this population is currently in clinical investigation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report describes a 77 year old male who received less than two cycles of therapy with ezatiostat HCl which had to be aborted due to intolerable side effects, but which produced a sustained normalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This trilineage response has now lasted for more than a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the patient began with a del(5q) abnormality and responded briefly to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon relapse of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, a bone marrow showed the disappearance of the del(5q) but the appearance of a new clonal abnormality t(2;3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given that the patient had a complete cytogenetic response to a truncated exposure to lenalidomide followed by a trilineage response to an even briefer course of ezatiostat HCl suggests a potential role for ezatiostat HCl in del(5q) patients who relapse following lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
