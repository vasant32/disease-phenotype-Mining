<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher percentage of the BM cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients reacted with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to myeloid antigens (CD13, CD15 and CD33) by cytoplasmic staining as compared with cell surface staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of BM cells expressing CD34 was markedly elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A distinct finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was the expression of myeloid antigens on mononuclear BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of individuals whose mononuclear BM cells were positive for surface reactivity with anti-CD13 and anti-CD33 mAbs was highest among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients while none of the patients with RA expressed these surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic staining significantly increased the percentage of CD13+ and CD33+ BM cells among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of individuals whose BM cells possessed myeloid antigens was increased by cytoplasmic staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BM of a considerable proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients showed cells which coexpressed the CD7 and CD3 lymphoid markers along with the CD13 and CD33 myeloid antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates the importance of comparative surface and cytoplasmic immunophenotyping with CD13 and CD33 mAbs for the diagnosis of subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The coexpression of CD3 and CD7 with markers of the myeloid lineage may reflect derangement of the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells characteristic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
