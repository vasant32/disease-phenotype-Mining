<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapses after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation have a poor prognosis; few respond to further chemotherapy, and almost none survive over the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present preliminary observations on the use of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) for relapse after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven female patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and one with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> that transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>) whose disease relapsed within 360 days after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation received filgrastim (5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day by subcutaneous injection) to reinduce remission by stimulating residual donor marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and determination of restriction-fragment--length polymorphisms were used to assess response and chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of the seven patients had a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission, with reestablishment of hematopoiesis of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> developed in one patient, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> in none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a relapse 12 months after treatment, and two others remained in remission after 10 and 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of the patients with a response, fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated stimulation of donor cells without differentiation of the leukemic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filgrastim may be effective in selected cases of leukemic relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
