<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between October 1991 and May 1994, 42 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, thiotepa, and total body irradiation followed by an allogeneic transplantation of marrow depleted of T cells with soybean agglutinin and E-rosetting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients included in this study had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (nine), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> or non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (four), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (three), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 34 (range 8 to 51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had a matched sibling donor and 18 received marrow from 6/6 matched unrelated donors while five received transplants from unrelated donors disparate at one DR locus (5/6 match) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to granulocyte engraftment (AGC &gt; or = 500/mm3) occurred at a mean of 16.5 days for related and 11.4 days for unrelated transplant recipients, and was related to the increased use of G-CSF in the unrelated population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation with number of mononuclear cells, T cells, or CD34-positive cells infused, the rate of engraftment or the incidence of transplant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis determined that G-CSF administration and a diagnosis other than ALL were the only factors associated with a faster rate of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving unrelated donor transplants, those with ALL, or those who had a low T cell number infused (&lt; or = 8.0 x 10(3) cells/kg) experienced delayed hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regimen resulted in excellent rates of engraftment (95.2%) with only one failure to engraft and one graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 0% with sibling and 26.1% with unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients are alive with a mean follow-up of 26.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this regimen is well tolerated and results in excellent engraftment with a low incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and few therapy-related toxicities </plain></SENT>
