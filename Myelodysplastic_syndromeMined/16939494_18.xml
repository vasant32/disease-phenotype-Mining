<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of a variety of clinical variables including the recently described haematopoietic cell transplantation co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of the cohort was 52.0 years (range: 19-68 years) with a median follow-up of 1038.5 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (65%) had an International Prognostic Scoring System stage of &gt; or = Intermediate-2, 35 (46%) had intermediate or poor risk cytogenetics, and 23 patients(31%) were human leucocyte antigen-mismatched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI): 37-49] and 41% (95%CI: 35-47) respectively, and the cumulative incidence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, presence of either one class II mismatch or a two-antigen mismatch adversely influenced transplant-related mortality, DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, disease status at transplantation and the haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index were independent variables for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both advanced age and pre-transplant cytogenetic status did not significantly affect overall outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIC regimens using VUD was associated with durable long-term survival even in older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the use of a pre-transplant comorbidity index may help to improve patient selection for transplantation </plain></SENT>
