<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To systematically evaluate the bone status, searching for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in patients with cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study from March 1997 to June 2000, we included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new patients examined for cutaneous signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Past history, physical examination, skin biopsy, laboratory tests, bone densitometry, cytology and histopathology of bone marrow and other complementary investigations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five others had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had bone marrow involvement due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study suggests better investigation of bone density and bone marrow in patients who have cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systematic histopathology of bone marrow and osteodensitometry help to detect patients with systemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone densitometry is particularly effective for early detection of patients at risk for fracture and is of practical interest since patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> can now be treated with Pamidronate </plain></SENT>
