<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have found statistically significant ultrastructural differences in the frequency and size of type IV nuclear bodies in the in vitro bone marrow fibroblastic cells (FC) derived from eight nonleukemic subjects and 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with ANLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, as a group, had four times as many type IV nuclear bodies as nonleukemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of type IV nuclear bodies for patients with ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> was 2.68% +/- 3.27% as compared with 0.63% +/- 1.06% for the nonleukemic subjects (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean maximum type IV nuclear body area of the ANLL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) patients as a group was 2.08 +/- 1.10 micron2, compared with a mean maximum area of 0.93 +/- 0.10 micron2 from nonleukemic subjects (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FC were otherwise morphologically indistinguishable and displayed the typical ultrastructural features of fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings have provided the first morphologic evidence that supports the concept of an altered bone marrow microenvironment in patients with ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since type IV nuclear bodies are found in high frequency in virally infected tissues, our quantitative ultrastructural findings raise the possibility of a local <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that affects the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with ANLL and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> disorders </plain></SENT>
