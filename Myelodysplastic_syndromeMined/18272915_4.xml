<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early recognition of disease progression in low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is an important decision point concerning intensive therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a screen program searching for dynamic prognostic determinants, we have identified <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) as a most suitable follow-up parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: LDH levels were serially determined in 221 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (median age 70 years, range 24-94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in LDH was correlated with survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confirming previous data, an elevated LDH at diagnosis was found to be associated with an increased probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution and decreased probability of survival (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up, we found that in patients who progressed (to higher IPSS category or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), LDH levels were significantly higher in the two 3-month period preceding progression compared with the initial two 3-month period (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients, the increase in LDH was accompanied or followed by other signs of disease progression, such as occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or appearance of circulating blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the LDH increase was found to be an independent prognostic variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LDH is an interesting follow-up parameter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may assist in early recognition of disease progression and thus help in risk stratification and patient selection for interventional therapies </plain></SENT>
