<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The GFI1 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor, which regulates myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the mouse, Gfi1 deficiency causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and an accumulation of granulomonocytic precursor cells that is reminiscent of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that a variant allele of GFI1 (GFI1(36N)) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in white subjects with an odds ratio of 1.6 (P &lt; 8 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GFI1(36N) variant occurred in 1806 AML patients with an allele frequency of 0.055 compared with 0.035 in 1691 healthy control patients in 2 independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that both GFI1 variants maintain the same activity as transcriptional repressors but differ in their regulation by the AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> (RUNX1/RUNX1T1) fusion protein produced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with a t(8;21) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> interacts and colocalizes with the more common GFI1(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37982">36S</z:chebi>) form in the nucleus and inhibits its repressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the variant GFI1(36N) protein has a different subnuclear localization than GFI1(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37982">36S</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> does not colocalize with GFI1(36N) and is unable to inhibit its repressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both variants of GFI1 differ in their ability to be regulated by interacting proteins and that the GFI1(36N) variant form exhibits distinct biochemical features that may confer a predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
