<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared the outcomes of 87 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) receiving matched sibling transplants with stem cells from peripheral blood (blood cell transplant, BCT) or bone marrow (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In good risk patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in CR1) granulocytes recovered to 0.5 x 10(9)/l a median of 14 days after BCT compared with 19 days after BMT (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patients with poor risk disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> beyond CR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) corresponding figures were 16 vs 26 days (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery to 20 x 10(9)/l was also faster after BCT (good risk 12 vs 20 days, P &lt; 0.0001; poor risk 17 vs 22 days, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Red cell transfusions were unaffected by cell source, but BCT recipients required less platelet transfusions (good risk 1 vs 5, P = 0.002; poor risk 5 vs 11, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood cell transplants resulted in more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (86% vs 48%, P = 0.005) and a significantly higher proportion of recipients with KPS of 80% or less (48% vs 5%, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival at 4 years was 23% for both groups of poor risk patients but outcome in good risk patients was better after BCT (93% vs 62%, P = 0.047) related mainly to less relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While disease-free survival may be better after BCT than BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in CR1, quality of life may be relatively impaired </plain></SENT>
