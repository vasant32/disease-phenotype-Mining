<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is frequently due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> is caused by a variety of factors and is not always a sign of pre-malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed myelodysplastic changes in peripheral blood smears and bone marrow specimens from a patient who had chromosomal microdeletion 22q11.2 (del22q11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then investigated such changes in several other patients who were newly diagnosed with del22q11.2 (n = 5 total, including the index case) and compared the findings to those in four sets of controls without this chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the controls were children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001710'>conotruncal heart defects</z:hpo> (n = 3); otherwise healthy children with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> (n = 4) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 4); and healthy children (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> scores in the myeloid cells and eosinophils of the children with del22q11 were higher than those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic changes in the peripheral blood of children with del22q11.2 have not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that certain gene(s) in the deleted region may be responsible for the myelodysplastic changes that we observed in our patients with this chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
