<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clonal nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has been demonstrated by various techniques: the stem cell involved initially is capable of myeloid and lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique which can be utilized without any pretreatment on whole interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study leukocytes of PB Wright-stained smears from four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (three cases) and 9 (one case) have been analyzed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a probe for the centromere of chromosome 8 and for the heterochromatic region of chromosome 9, we observed the cells involved by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each of the four cases neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes may show <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or 9, whereas lymphocytes resulted disomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison between leukocytes <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and genotype suggests that the supernumerary chromosome does not influence cellular differentiation and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FISH analysis of PB leukocytes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> is informative when studying the clonality of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities seem to involve a hematopoietic cell committed to myeloid but not lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomies</z:mp> 8 and 9 seem to confer some proliferative advantage without influencing the morphologic characteristics of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other causes will be investigated to explain dysmorphisms of neutrophils and monocytes typical of this disease </plain></SENT>
