<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, risk assessment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> has been mainly based on disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prognostic impact of comorbidity on the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with the aim of developing novel tools for risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population included a learning cohort of 840 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in Pavia, Italy, and a validation cohort of 504 patients followed in Duesseldorf, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on comorbidity was extracted from detailed review of the patients' medical charts and laboratory values at diagnosis and during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multivariable survival analyses with both fixed and time-dependent covariates were performed using Cox's proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was present in 54% of patients in the learning cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac disease</z:e> was the most frequent comorbidity and the main cause of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, comorbidity had a significant impact on both non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P=0.01) and overall survival (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac, liver, renal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> were found to independently affect the risk of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A time-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-specific comorbidity index (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI) was developed for predicting the effect of comorbidity on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This identified three groups of patients which showed significantly different probabilities of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) and survival (P=0.005) also in the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Landmark survival analyses at fixed time points from diagnosis showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI can better define the life expectancy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> stratified according to the WHO-classification based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS).Comorbidities have a significant impact on the outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Accounting for both disease status by means of the WPSS and comorbidity through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI considerably improves risk stratification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
