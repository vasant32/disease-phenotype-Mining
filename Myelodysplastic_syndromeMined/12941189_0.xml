<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the apoptotic situation of CD(34) positive cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In 36 MDS patients, immunocytochemical technique was used for the detection of the expression of CD(34) antigen and DNA in situ end labelling (ISEL) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>) for the apoptotic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemias</z:hpo> (IDA) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) CD(34) expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group was much higher than that in controls (49.2 +/- 38.5 vs 10.2 +/- 9.7, P &lt; 0.01), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases had an obviously higher apoptotic rate than control did (69.1 +/- 28.2 vs 17.8 +/- 11.2, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Expression of CD(34) was higher in transforming group (P &lt; 0.05) than in non-transforming and post-transforming groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic rates in both non-transforming/transforming group were higher than in post-transforming group (P &lt; 0.02 and &lt; 0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found in CD(34) positive cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; (4) Both CD(34) positive cells and apoptotic cells formed into small or large clusters but did not co-distributed in a given area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is overexpression of CD(34) antigen on hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High CD(34) expression accompanied high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> coexisted in the process of transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistance of these CD(34) positive cells suggested that they came from malignant hematopoietic cell clones </plain></SENT>
