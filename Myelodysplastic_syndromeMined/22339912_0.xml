<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay and colorimetry were used to determine the Hepcidin, serum ferritin (SF) and serum iron (SI) levels of 106 serum samples from 68 cases of transfusion dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, 30 serum samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without transfusion and 60 serum samples of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group, Hepcidin level in blood transfusion &lt; 9 U subgroup was significantly higher than that in control group \[(583 ± 50) µg/L vs (175 ± 35) µg/L\] and there was a strong positive correlation between Hepcidin levels and SF (r = 0.976), but no correlation between Hepcidin and SI (r = 0.284); Both Hepcidin and SF level in transfusion 9 ∼ 24 U subgroup was significantly higher than those in control group \[(665 ± 80) µg/L vs (175 ± 35) µg/L; (1445 ± 275) µg/L vs (112 ± 26)µg/L\]; whereas for SI level, there was no difference between transfusion 9 ∼ 24 U subgroup and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin did not correlate with SF or SI; For blood transfusion &gt; 24 U group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of Hepcidin, SF and SI levels were higher than those in control groups \[(703 ± 64) µg/L vs (175 ± 35) µg/L; (2587 ± 352) µg/L vs (112 ± 26)µg/L; (20 ± 4) µg/L vs (14 ± 4) µmol/L\], Hepcidin negatively correlated with SF and SI (r = -0.536; r = -0.456) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients were significantly lower than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients \[(260 ± 40) µg/L vs (442 ± 51) µg/L\], and there was no significant difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> group and control group regardless of the number of blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both Hepcidin and SF levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients regardless of transfusion dependent or not, or the number of blood transfused were higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the increase of Hepcidin can not synchronize with the increase of SF level due to the increased blood transfusion, when blood transfusion &gt; 24 U, Hepcidin level showed a negative relationship with SF and SI, reflecting the decreased ability of Hepcidin to inhibit body iron absorption during the increase of blood transfusion, which finally would lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We can predict the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in transfusion dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by dynamic monitoring concentration of Hepcidin </plain></SENT>
