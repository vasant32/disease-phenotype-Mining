<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolving from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and the blast <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was undifferentiated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data available from the literature on acquired anomalies involving 17q and our observation led us to postulate a specific link between the gain of 17q and complete chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
