<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a total of 1933 unrelated donor-recipient pairs who underwent PBSC transplantation between 1999 and 2006 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and received high-resolution HLA typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared between HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched pairs, adjusting for patient and transplant characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matching for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 alleles (8/8 match) was associated with better survival at 1 year compared with 7/8 HLA-matched pairs (56% vs 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using 8/8 HLA-matched patients as the baseline (n = 1243), HLA-C antigen mismatches (n = 189) were statistically significantly associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (relative risk [RR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.64; P = .0010), and increased risk for mortality (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.70; P = .0005), treatment-related mortality (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.25-2.08; P = .0002), and grade III-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.50-2.62; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-B antigen or allele mismatching was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in outcome were observed for HLA-C allele (n = 61), HLA-A antigen/allele (n = 136), HLA-DRB1 allele (n = 39), or HLA-DQ antigen/allele (n = 114) mismatches compared with 8/8 HLA-matched pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA mismatch was not associated with relapse or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-C antigen-mismatched unrelated PBSC donors were associated with worse outcomes compared with 8/8 HLA-matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study's limited power due to small sample size precludesÂ conclusions about other mismatches </plain></SENT>
