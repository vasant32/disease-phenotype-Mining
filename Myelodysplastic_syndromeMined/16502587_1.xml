<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several years ago, it was demonstrated that it is also overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the exact role of this gene in the hematopoietic system is still quite completely obscure, it represents a reliable marker for the detection of the presence of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WT1 quantitative assessment may therefore represent a useful tool for the diagnosis and follow up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we describe the method for the quantification of WT1 transcript by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
