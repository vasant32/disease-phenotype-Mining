<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ASXL1 and ASXL2 genes, encoding Polycomb group protein with ASXN and ASXM domains, are human homologs of Drosophila additional sex combs (asx) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exons 2-13 of the ASXL2 gene are fused to exons 1-14 of the MYST3 gene in a case of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> due to t(2;8)(p23.3;p11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified the ASXL3 gene, a novel human homolog of Drosophila asx, by using bioinformatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ASXL3 gene, consisting of 12 exons, was located within human genome sequences RP11-562H1 (AC023192.8), RP11-265C19 (AC090989.8), and RP11-470B24 (AC010798.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete coding sequence of human ASXL3 cDNA was determined by assembling EST BE145544, exons 4-11, and 5'-truncated KIAA1713 cDNA (AB051500.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial coding sequence of mouse Asxl3 cDNA was derived from 3'-truncated C230079D11 cDNA (AK082659.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human ASXL3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in pancreatic islet, testis as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human ASXL3 protein (2248 aa) with ASXN, ASXM and PHD domains was the third member of the human ASXL family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The region between ASXM and PHD domains was divergent among ASXL family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proline-rich domain was located within the divergent region of ASXL3, but not within that of ASXL1 and ASXL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ASXL3-DTNA locus at chromosome 18q12.1 and ASXL2-DTNB locus at 2p23.3 were paralogous regions within the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ASXL3 was a predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated gene, just like ASXL1 and ASXL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on identification and characterization of the ASXL3 gene </plain></SENT>
