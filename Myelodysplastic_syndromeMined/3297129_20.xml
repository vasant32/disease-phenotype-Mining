<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treated group were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> 20 mg/d if marrow blasts were less than or equal to 5% or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> 10 mg/d subcutaneously on 6 d/week if marrow blasts were 6-30%, to which <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> was added after 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of the drugs in the treated group were similar to those that would produce inhibition of CFU-GM growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients in the low blast group receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, myeloid surface antigens reverted from an abnormal to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Log rank analysis carried out after 25 months showed no significant difference in survival between the treated and control group, either in the total patient population or in the high and low blast groups considered separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of 39 non-sideroblastic patients with less than or equal to 5% blasts showed an increase in survival in the treated group </plain></SENT>
