<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 42 IPSS intermediate-2 and high-risk patients with moderate, mild or no RI undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> therapy in a non-trial setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups achieved comparable responses and had similar overall and event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, both treatment toxicity and dose adjustments were not significantly influenced by renal function status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transient but reversible decline in glomerular filtration rate was observed in patients either with or without RI, without affecting the therapeutic schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> is effective and well-tolerated in patients with mild and moderate RI and, if confirmed by prospective randomized studies, advocate that such patients can be managed in an analogous fashion to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function </plain></SENT>
