<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no polymorphisms of PRDM16 gene in bovine had been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing methods were employed to screen the genetic variation within PRDM16 gene in 1031 Chinese indigenous bovine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results revealed two novel silent mutations: XM_001788152: m.1641T&gt;C (547aa), 1881G&gt;A (627aa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, we described the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLP methods for detecting these mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with PvuII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-C allele varied from 0.044 to 0.506 in four Chinese native breeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with HaeIII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-G allele were 0.474, 0.494, 0.576 and 0.906 for Jiaxian (JX), Nanyang (NY), Qinchuan (QC) and Chinese Holstein (CH) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant statistical differences between genotypic frequencies implied that both of the polymorphic loci were significantly associated with cattle breeds by the chi square test (chi2 = 190.058, P &lt; 0.001 and chi2 = 118.239, P &lt; 0.001 for PvuII; chi2 = 209.842, P &lt; 0.001 and chi2 = 108.711, P &lt; 0.001 for HaeIII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations of the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLPs of bovine PRDM16 loci with growth traits were analyzed in Nanyang breed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs were associated with body weight and average daily gain in Nanyang aged 12 months, individuals with genotype TT and AA showed significantly better body weight (P &lt; 0.05) and average daily gain (P &lt; 0.01) at 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
