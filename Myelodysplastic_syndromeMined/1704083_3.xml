<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the effects of the combination of interleukin 3 (Il-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and the effect of the conditioned medium of the giant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM) on the proliferation of myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) marrow myeloid progenitor cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (NBM) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colony growth was most effectively sustained by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM and G-CSF in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (NBM) cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF and Il-3 were less effective in inducing myeloid granulocytic colony growth, whereas the effects of Il-3 and GM-CSF were found to be approximately additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of NBM granulocytic colonies induced by G-CSF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM stimulation were comparable, whereas this granulocyte colony stimulating activity could be neutralized by anti-G-CSF antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM was found to contain burst promoting activity, which could be neutralized by anti-Il-3 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Il-3 did not enhance the G-CSF activity in NBM cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No additive effect of stimulation with the combination of Il-3 and GM-CSF was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cultures, suggesting that these growth factors act on an identical progenitor cell population in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>G-CSF stimulated the growth of significantly lower colony numbers than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>-CM, in contrast to NBM cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased granulocytic colony formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells could clearly be enhanced by co-stimulation with Il-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> myeloid progenitor cells require the exposure to both a pluripotent colony stimulating factor, like Il-3, and a lineage specific factor, like G-CSF, for optimal proliferation </plain></SENT>
