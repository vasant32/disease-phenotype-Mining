<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis, we investigated the effect of i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> dosing (total dose 3.2 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg) in RIC regimens that combined fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> on outcomes in patients who were undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 217 patients, 135 patients received Bu1 (3.2 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>) and 82 patients received Bu2 (6.4 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>), both with daily fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical disease status was similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up for survivors was 4.4 years for Bu1 and 3.2 years for Bu2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 2-year cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was not significantly different between Bu1 and Bu2 (41.5% versus 28%, respectively; HR, .70; CI, .42 to 1.17; P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two-year nonrelapse mortality rates were similar for Bu1 and Bu2 (8.9% versus 9.8%, respectively; HR, .80; CI, .29 to 2.21; P = .67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two-year progression-free survival and overall survival were also similar between Bu1 and Bu2 (progression-free survival: 40.6% versus 39.3%, respectively; HR, .82; CI, .57 to 1.30; P = .33; and overall survival: 47.4% versus 48.8%, respectively; HR, .96; CI, .64 to 1.44; P = .85) </plain></SENT>
