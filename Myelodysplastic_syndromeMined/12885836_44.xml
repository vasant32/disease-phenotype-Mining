<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with DS and newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> were prospectively enrolled on Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group study 2891 (N = 161) and treated uniformly with four standard timing induction courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, 6-thioguanine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DCTER) followed by intensively timed high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with DS were significantly younger at diagnosis than those without (median age, 1.8 v 7.5 years, respectively; P &lt;.001), with more megakaryocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (70% v 6%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher complete remission rates (91%) were achieved in children with DS than among those without DS (75%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Equivalent grade 3 to 4 toxicity (29% v 30%; P =.84) was seen, though children with DS had greater pulmonary toxicity (P &lt;.01) during induction and mucositis during intensification (P =.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with DS had significantly better 8-year event-free survival (EFS; 77% v 21% standard and 40% intensive induction; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis in children with DS revealed that only age at diagnosis of 2 years or older was a risk factor for greater relapse risk (odds ratio, 4.9; P =.006) and worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children between ages 0 to 2 years (n = 94) had a 6-year EFS of 86%; those from 2 to 4 years (n = 58), 70%; and those older than 4 years (n = 9), 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remission failures were the primary reason for worse 6-year EFSs (1% in those 0 to 2 years v 14% if &gt;2 years; P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcome for children with DS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is excellent with standard induction therapy, but declines with increasing age </plain></SENT>
