<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P53 gene mutations are also found in 10 to 15% of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because it has recently been suggested that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 suppressed, but that mutated p53 activated, the mdr1 gene promoter, we tried to correlate p53 mutations and P <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression in 34 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and an excess of bone marrow blasts (&gt; 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry using JSB1 monoclonal antibody and was found positive in 13 out of the 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 mutations were detected both by immunocytochemistry using three different monoclonal antibodies and by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the P53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both methods detected a point mutation in 5 out of the 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one out of the 5 patients with a p53 mutation expressed P <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, as compared to 12 out of the 29 patients without p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggested the mutant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 are not major determinants of the regulation of mdr1 expression in vivo, at least in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
