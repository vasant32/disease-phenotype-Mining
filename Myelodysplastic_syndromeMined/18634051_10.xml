<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival of this cohort was 9.5 months, shorter than reported in earlier series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The least favorable outcomes are associated with complex cytogenetics, lack of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases, normocytic rather than macrocytic erythrocyte indices, and low baseline lymphocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>Lymphopenia</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis appears to be a new adverse prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic breakpoints defined by G-banded karyotyping correlate poorly with particular disease features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, survival of patients with treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was equivalent to that of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q) in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphologic features associated with del(5q) are diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> do not meet criteria for WHO-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, and the presence of del(5q) does not appear to modify the clinical phenotype otherwise risk-stratified by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional important prognostic factors not taken into account by the IPSS include the baseline erythrocyte indices, lymphocyte count, and clonal burden </plain></SENT>
