<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show for the first time, that fetuin is abundantly present in many cells of the foetal human bone marrow, but is restricted to cells of the monocytic lineage in the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetuin's immunoreactivity increased considerably in adult human bone marrow in some pathological conditions, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> and was also increased in bone marrows in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This increase in the presence of fetuin in neoplastic bone marrows is not reflected by an increased level of circulating fetuin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This last observation contradicts earlier suggestions that fetuin is specifically reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A consistent increase in fetuin immunoreactivity in bone marrow of most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, as demonstrated in this paper, could become a useful tool in the diagnosis of this disease </plain></SENT>
