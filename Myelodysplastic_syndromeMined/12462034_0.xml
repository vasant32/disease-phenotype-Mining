<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy with the CAG regimen did not seem to be enough to lower WT1 expression levels to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison with patients who received intensive chemotherapy for post-remission therapy, those who received only CAG therapy showed higher levels of WT1 expression and more easily relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CAG therapy alone might not be sufficient to maintain complete remission and WT1 monitoring could be useful in the choice of appropriate post-remission therapy after achieving remission with the CAG regimen </plain></SENT>
