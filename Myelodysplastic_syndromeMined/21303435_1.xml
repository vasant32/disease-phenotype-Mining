<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Clinical outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in elderly patients still remain unsatisfactory and the optimal treatment has yet to be clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the results of a retrospective study of clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients aged 75 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we aimed to elucidate the situation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which has been largely ignored in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects consisted of 31 patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (including previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent chemotherapy, with 25 undergoing conventional therapy and six undergoing low-intensity therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 16 of the 31 cases (51.6%), with a 3-year survival rate of 11.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in seven cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although we were able to perform induction therapy in each of these cases, consolidation therapy was difficult in cases of moderate AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that even very elderly patients can benefit from chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is thought that the treatment selection for cases which are complicated by moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> should be determined carefully while considering the patient's quality of life </plain></SENT>
