<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to obtain first estimates of the safety and efficacy of FK506 monotherapy in the prevention of GVHD following HLA-identical sibling marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a subset of patients was studied to define the pharmacokinetic profile of FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> received FK506 starting the day before transplant at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/d by continuous intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When clinically possible, FK506 was given orally in two divided doses starting at five times the daily intravenous dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FK506 doses were adjusted to target a steady state or trough blood level between 10 to 30 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed for 6 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had sustained marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequently noted adverse events included reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients required FK506 dose reductions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two (7%) patients relapsed, one of whom died of the disease within the 6-month study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A second patient died due to pulmonary mucor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whole blood pharmacokinetic parameters indicated a half-life of 18.2 +/- 12.1 hours; volume of distribution of 1.67 +/- 1.02 L/kg; clearance of 71 +/- 34 mL/h/kg; and bioavailability of 32 +/- 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 27 (41%) patients developed grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, including 10 grade II and one grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six of 24 (25%) evaluable patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that FK506 monotherapy has activity in preventing GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies of FK506 with lower doses to improve tolerability and in combination with other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> to augment efficacy are warranted </plain></SENT>
