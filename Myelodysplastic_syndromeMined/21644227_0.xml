<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the HLA-DRB1 polymorphism with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The polymorphism of HLA-DRB1 alleles in 242 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 115 patients with AA and 2264 umbilical cord blood control samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group and AA group (22.93% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square = 9.662, OR= 1.428, P= 0.003; 26.52% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square = 12.924, OR= 1.732, P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And this is mainly due to the increase in the male patients in both patient groups: in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> males, 24.68% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square= 11.194, OR= 1.572, P= 0.001, and in the AA males, 29.29% vs. 17.25%, Chi-square= 13.563, OR= 1.987, P= 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between the controls and the female patients in both groups was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DRB1*15 could be a susceptibility allele for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA male patients </plain></SENT>
