<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mouse models with conditional knockout of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) genes have revealed a role of DNA methylation in mediating the self-renewal and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> stem cells (LSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, various mutations of DNMT3A and other DNA methylation regulators have been identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of these mutations may lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, and even the discovery of new biomarkers and/or drug targets, as well as more rational design of therapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DNMTs inhibitors as epigenetic drugs have already been approved by US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use and some clinical trials are currently underway in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the biology of DNMTs with regard to epigenetic regulation, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> renewal/differentiation, and drug discovery for targeted therapy, and delineates the latest studies that have been conducted to unfold the relationship between aberrant DNMTs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
