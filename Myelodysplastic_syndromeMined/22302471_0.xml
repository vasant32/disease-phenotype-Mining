<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed patients aged C 50 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) to identify preoperative variables predicting the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 71 patients with a median age of 57 years (range: 50-63 years) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 53) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloablative conditioning was done in 35 patients and 36 patients had reduced-intensity conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate (OS), cumulative relapse rate, and non-relapse mortality rate (NRM) were 45, 24, and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, high-risk disease (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.43-8.56, P = 0.006), a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) score ≥ 3 (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.31-14.77, P = 0.016), and an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (HR 4.03, 95% CI 1.46-11.10, P = 0.007) were significant predictors of worse OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highrisk disease was also significantly associated with a higher cumulative relapse rate (HR 4.59, 95% CI 0.94-6.92, P = 0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an HCT-CI score ≥ 3 (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.01-20.78, P = 0.048) and an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.04-8.74, P = 0.042) were risk factors for NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the disease risk, HCT-CI score, and donor type/histocompatibility are prognostic factors for elderly patients, while the conditioning regimen and age are not predictors </plain></SENT>
