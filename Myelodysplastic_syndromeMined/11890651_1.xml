<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted using anti-TNFalpha/anti-inhibitory cytokine approaches, either alone or in combination with other agents, capable of abrogating the effects of additional inhibitory mechanisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
