<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Without any stimulation, ALP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed only in PMNs, G-CSFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in PMNs were expressed stronger than in MNCs; both MPO and defensin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were expressed to the same degree in both fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With stimulation, the ALP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in both fractions was strongly enhanced by G-CSF, but the expression was inhibited by GM-CSF and/or IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was stimulated by G-CSF and/or GM-CSF in MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-CSFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was enhanced by G-CSF in both fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defensin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was inhibited by G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> which display a suppressed maturation of myeloid cells, our results demonstrated an almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response to these growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that studies on these myeloid marker <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions would provide more knowledge about the differentiation state and cytokine reactivity of myeloid cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals as well as various disorders </plain></SENT>
