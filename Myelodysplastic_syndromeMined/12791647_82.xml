<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (32%) achieved complete response (CR), 1 had a partial response (PR), and 9 (15%) achieved CR but without platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, responses were noted in 2 (18%) of 11 patients in first salvage with short first CR (&lt;/= 12 months), in 7 (87%) of 8 patients with longer first CR, and in 8 (67%) of 12 patients in second or subsequent salvage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed in 4 of 8 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (50%), in 7 (64%) of 11 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BP, and in 2 (17%) of 12 with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> was noted in 15% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first clofarabine infusion, responders accumulated more clofarabine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> in blasts compared with nonresponders (median 18 vs 10 microM; P =.03) </plain></SENT>
