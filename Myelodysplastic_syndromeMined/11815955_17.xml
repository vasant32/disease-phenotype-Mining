<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endostatin, a C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While endostatin is being investigated for its usefulness in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, its significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated plasma endostatin (PE) levels using an enzyme linked immunoassay in 71 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and correlated PE with various clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the median PE level between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, patients who achieved complete remission (CR) had a significantly lower median PE level compared to those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, PE was found to be a significant (P = 0.03) predictor of overall survival (OS) with adjustment of the other baseline covariates, including patient age, history of antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>, and the use of protective environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of PE was also evaluated by dividing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients into high and low PE groups using the median PE level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls as the cut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors found that patients in the high PE group survived for a significantly shorter time than those patients in the low PE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PE is a useful prognostic predictor of CR and OS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the association between high PE and poor clinical outcome is unclear, although it may be related to the possible PE reflection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
