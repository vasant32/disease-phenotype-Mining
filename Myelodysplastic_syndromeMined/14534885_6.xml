<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Levels of the soluble form of CD86 (sCD86) are elevated in a proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is a potential modulator of antitumor responses, the significance of sCD86 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated sCD86 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 57 patients) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 40 patients) and analyzed the relation between sCD86 levels and various clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of sCD86 were elevated (&gt; 2.32 ng/mL) relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (0.22-2.32 ng/mL; n = 51 patients) in 25% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and in 27% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who had elevated sCD86 levels had significantly lower complete remission (CR) rates compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sCD86 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis using sCD86 as a continuous variable and including the interaction of age and sCD86 as a variable, sCD86 was a significant prognostic factor (P = 0.014) independent of cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis demonstrated that, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> age 60 years and younger, but not in patients older than 60 years, elevated sCD86 levels were associated with significantly shorter survival (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between sCD86 levels and CR rates or survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> of elevated levels of circulating sCD86 were associated with lower CR rates and poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of sCD86 was independent of cytogenetics but was modulated by age, in that it was independently significant only in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that sCD86 may play a role in modulating immune responses associated with the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
