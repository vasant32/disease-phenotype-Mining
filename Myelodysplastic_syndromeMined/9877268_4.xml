<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with abnormal karyotype at diagnosis who underwent peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumour</z:e> cells, bone marrow (BM) samples and PBSC collections were analysed by cytogenetics and in selected cases also by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were considered to be in morphologic and cytogenetic complete remission (CR) at the time of mobilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients showed neoplastic cells in PBSC harvest and/or BM specimen before reinfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies revealed contamination in apheretic collections in one patient only, while three patients had BM but not PBSC contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three more patients had leukaemic cells both in the BM and PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one (with only BM contamination) of these patients relapsed within 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, five more patients relapsed after transplantation: in four cases there was no cytogenetic sign of contamination either in PBSC or BM cells and in one case no molecular evidence was revealed either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that, whereas the presence of leukaemic cells in autologous grafts correlates with a poor prognosis, the lack of detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells is not always predictive of long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, PBSC collections from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients are not contaminated by leukaemic cells if the BM is disease-free </plain></SENT>
