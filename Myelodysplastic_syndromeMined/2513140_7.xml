<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioning therapy preceding BMT consisted of fractionated total-body irradiation (12 Gy) and high-dose chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (2 +/- 60 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients stratified to be at high risk for relapse (6/13) were additionally treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of absolute and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-standardized <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi>) decreased following conditioning therapy, presumably as the result of an enhanced breakdown of these <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi> treatment did not amplify the loss of essential anti-oxidants but significantly increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> concentrations in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the abnormal generation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923,35924">hydroperoxides</z:chebi> is the result of free radical formation </plain></SENT>
