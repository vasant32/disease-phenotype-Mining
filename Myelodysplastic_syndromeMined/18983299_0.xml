<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose a partial NDC (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e>) comprising only immature haemopoietic cells capable of division, i.e. myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes and erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that the myeloid : erythroid (M : E) ratio of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> remains approximately constant in progressively dilute aliquots of BM aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> in 22 healthy subjects and investigated the effect of peripheral blood dilution on disease stratification of 66 BM aspirates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NDC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> myeloblast counts were compared and the equivalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> myeloblast counts for NDC myeloblast threshold counts of 5, 10 and 20% were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reclassification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> resulted in a change in disease category in 33.3% of 51 MDS samples with NDC myeloblast counts ranging from 3 to 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNDC</z:e> is independent of PBNC dilution and can be determined in dilute BM samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It alters the disease category in a significant proportion of BM aspirates with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and has the potential to better stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to improve clinical outcomes and treatment </plain></SENT>
