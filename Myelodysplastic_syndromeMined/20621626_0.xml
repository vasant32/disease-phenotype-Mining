<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is suggested to follow a multistep pathogenesis and is characterized by accumulation of molecular defects of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, resulting in aberrant differentiation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To detect alterations within the transcriptional program in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived CD34(+) cells during lineage-specific differentiation, we performed serial gene expression analysis of in vitro differentiated erythro-, granulo-, and megakaryopoietic cells using oligonucleotide microarrays (HG-U133A, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For selected genes, expression data were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified genes with altered expression during lineage-specific differentiation in either low- or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells compared to the expression patterns of continuously up- or downregulated genes from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcriptional program of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cluster analyses, we could show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples have a distinct expression pattern of a set of selected genes compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, which allows prediction of the affiliation of a sample to one group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study gives an overview of genes that are differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data provide the first comprehensive transcriptional analysis of differentiating human CD34(+) cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It gives new insights into the alteration of differentiation and proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stem cells </plain></SENT>
