<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study we investigated the influence of radioimmunotherapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb on changes on TNF-alpha serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS, METHODS: In 18 patients we measured TNF-alpha before and up to 96 hours after radioimmunotherapy, in 2 patients in addition following TBI, in 9 patients also following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For measuring TNF-alpha we used an automated immunochemiluminescence assay (Immulite 1000 DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up period to record incidence of aGVHD was 100 days after stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the basal levels before, the levels of TNF-alpha after conditioning with 188Re-CD-66-mAb did not increase significantly and remained in the physiological range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these initial physiological cytokine levels increased and became pathological following 48 h after total body irradiation (13.2+/-6.6 pg/ml) and chemotherapy (10.8+/-15.7 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study we found a low incidence of aGvHD (22.2%, n=4/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that additional conditioning therapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb does not increase proinflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding may indicate that additive radioimmunotherapy may not be a significant factor for increasing the rate of conditioning-associated aGvHD </plain></SENT>
