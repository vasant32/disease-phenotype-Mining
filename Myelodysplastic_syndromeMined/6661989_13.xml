<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with stable clinical course for up to 3 years had higher fractions of cells in S and G2 phases (22.7 +/- 12.4% and 12 +/- 3.6%) than those who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and/or died early in the course of disease (14.4 +/- 8.5% and 6.6 +/- 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival was more than 36 mo in patients with S + G2 cell fraction higher than 24%, and 14 mo in the remaining 16 patients with lower values (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses repeated after 3-24 mo showed no major changes in cell proliferation pattern in ten out of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had sharp decrease in S and G2 cell fraction 3 mo before the transition into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA index (DI) of bone marrow cells was calculated to assess ploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, comparative evaluation of cytologic, cytogenetic, and flow cytometric data suggest that, under our experimental conditions, the DI may be influenced by factors such as the degree of chromatin compactness </plain></SENT>
