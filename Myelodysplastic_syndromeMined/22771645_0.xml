<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-phenotype has been described in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>; recently it has been reported in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the presence of CD55 negative and/or CD59 negative red blood cell (RBC) populations in newly diagnosed treatment naive-54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and 29 MM patients by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-phenotype was not reported in any patient; however, RBC populations deficient in CD55 were detected in 16.66% (9/54) CLL and 6.89% (2/29) MM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation or the hematological parameters did not show any relationship with the presence of CD55 deficient RBC population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-phenotype in patients with CLL and MM; however, isolated CD55 deficient RBC were identified in both CLL and MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies by other centers, including simultaneous analysis of granulocytes for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-phenotype, are needed to corroborate these findings and to work out the mechanisms and the significance of the existence of this phenotype in these patients </plain></SENT>
