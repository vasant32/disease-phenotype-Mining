<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of high-dose sequential chemotherapy (HDS) as salvage therapy in patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on 77 patients receiving HDS between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients enrolled were in disease progression or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>, or did not achieve a complete remission after first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HDS consisted of the sequential administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with stem cell harvesting, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients had stage III/IV (64%) and B symptoms (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease status improvement after HDS was observed in 24 of 57 patients (42%) previously in disease progression or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HDS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in 8 of 77 patients (10.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (5.2%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, disease-free and progression-free survival was 27%, 57%, and 25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the treatment-related mortality, HDS is feasible, with satisfactory response rates, even in patients with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
