<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients heterozygous for at least one of these probes were studied: 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 2 with RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), and 4 with RA with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> exhibited clonal hematopoiesis as determined by Southern analysis of DNA prepared from peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three of the six patients heterozygous for the PGK1 gene, purified cell suspensions of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), monocytes, lymphocytes, and/or T cells prepared from PB were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, five of these patients were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure as described recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method was slightly adapted to facilitate the analysis of cell lysates of fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome of Southern and PCR analysis was concordant, showing that PMN and monocytes were clonally derived, whereas circulating T and B lymphocytes and NK cells exhibited random X-chromosome inactivation compatible with a polyclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To address the question of whether T cells are derived from unaffected progenitor cells or that their origin had antedated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, naive and memory T cells were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both subsets showed a polyclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in one patient analysis of constitutive DNA suggested a skewed methylation, and the presence of clonal lymphocytes against a background of polyclonal lymphoid cells cannot be ruled out in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of PB and BM cells showed a nonrandom, unilateral pattern of X-inactivation, compatible with a mixture of clonally (myeloid) and polyclonally (lymphoid) derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in some patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> represents a disorder with clonal hematopoiesis restricted to cells of myeloid origin, whereas a random X-inactivation pattern is found in lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
