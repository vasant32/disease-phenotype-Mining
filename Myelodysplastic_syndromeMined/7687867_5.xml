<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>FLT4 is a recently cloned receptor tyrosine kinase cDNA, which is characterized by seven immunoglobulin-like loops in its extracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously mapped the FLT4 gene to chromosome segment 5q33-qter using somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have refined the localization to band 5q35 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and show that the gene is translocated to chromosomes 2 and 6 in the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and t(5;6)(q35;p21) translocations, respectively, of Ki-I-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well as to chromosome 3 in the t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) translocation, which is occasionally found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No evidence was obtained for a rearrangement or deregulation of the translocated FLT4 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further show that abundant FLT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression occurs only in erythroid and megakaryoblastoid cell lines among nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
