<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were reviewed for clinical, hematologic, histopathologic, and cytogenetic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 1.61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (36%) were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA); seven (13%) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>); 13 (24%) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>); 11 (20%) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>); and four (7%) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (49%) died during the follow-up period, seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variables that showed association with survival by univariate analysis included the absolute neutrophil count, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, percentage of blasts, number of cytopenias, abnormal localization of immature precursors, and IPSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When entered into a regression model, IPSS showed a trend towards an association with survival (P 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the IPSS can prognostically stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no independent prognostic factor was confirmed in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess the utility of IPSS </plain></SENT>
