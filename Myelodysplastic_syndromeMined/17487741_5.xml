<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be the initial site of apoptotic signal induced by homoharringtonine in MUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After incubation with homoharringtonine, the percentage of apoptotic MUTZ-1 cells increased in a time-dependent manner, Ca(2+) translocated from ER pool to cytosol, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential decreased, and Bid protein translocated from ER to mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activation of ER stress-associated proapoptotic factor CHOP and ER chaperones BiP and XBP1 genes followed by cleavage of caspase-3 but not caspase-4 protein were also observed </plain></SENT>
