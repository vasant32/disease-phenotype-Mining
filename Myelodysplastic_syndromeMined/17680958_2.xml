<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-Wr(a) has been reported to be present in 1 : 25 to 1 : 100 healthy blood donors and an even higher proportion of hospital patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incompatibility due to anti-Wr(a) might therefore be expected to occur in approximately 1 in 50,000 blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemolytic transfusion reactions</z:e> (HTR) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemolytic disease of the newborn</z:e> due to anti-Wr(a) are, however, rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HTR due to anti-Wr(a) in a 58-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> associated with rigors, <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> and a significant rise in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> from 16 micromol L(-1) pretransfusion to 110 micromol L(-1) immediately afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by the appearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29026">urobilinogen</z:chebi> in his urine and a fall in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> of nearly 2 g dL(-1) following the transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-Wr(a) was the only antibody implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When tested against the recipients plasma, Wr(a+) panel cells and the transfused unit responsible for the reaction were 2-3+ by indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) and the donation typed as Wr(a+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recipient had the common Wr(a-) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reaction resulted in the patient being admitted to hospital for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increasing use of electronic issue may result in more frequent reports of reactions due to anti-Wr(a) using current screening cells </plain></SENT>
