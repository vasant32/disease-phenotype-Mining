<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand the cytogenetic mechanisms responsible for multiple RUNX1 gene copy numbers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, we analyzed the chromosomal and molecular cytogenetic findings in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of individuals who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included in the analysis were 113 consecutive samples received in our laboratory between January 2005 and June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples were characterized using conventional G-banding techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques with commercially available RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or ETV6/RUNX1 dual-color fusion probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one (72%) of the 113 samples showed an abnormal karyotype and/or abnormal FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of these had, by interphase FISH, RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or RUNX1/ETV6 fusion, and 19 had three or more RUNX1 signals not related to fusion with RUNX1T1 or ETV6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 cases with multiple RUNX1 gene signals, 5 had high-level RUNX1 amplification--defined as 5 or more RUNX1 signals in interphase cells--whereas the remaining 14 had 3-4 RUNX1 signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high-level RUNX1 amplification were myeloid disorders--three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high-level amplification of RUNX1 were significantly characterized by the presence of marker chromosomes that harbored extra copies of the RUNX1 gene compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that had three to four RUNX1 gene signals (P=0.026, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that high-level RUNX1 amplification, especially in myeloid disorders, often results from marker chromosomes harboring extra copies of the RUNX1 gene  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that amplification of RUNX1 in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may be secondary to a previous rearrangement of 21q22, which later evolved into a complex marker chromosome as part of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
