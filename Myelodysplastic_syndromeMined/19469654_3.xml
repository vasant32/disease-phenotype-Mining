<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it often progress to poor outcome stages or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> we searched for candidate genes associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using microarrays we performed gene expression profiling in CD34+ cells of 4 early and 4 advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and identified 286 significantly differentially expressed genes between these two categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 136 genes were up-regulated and 150 down-regulated in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using clustering analysis those two patient categories were clearly differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we selected three genes (ADAM8, BIRC5, MPL) for gene expression validation by qRT-PCR in an additional set of 29 MDS and sAML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We confirmed decreasing trend for BIRC5 expression from early to advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with the lowest levels in sAML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, higher ADAM8 and MPL expression was observed in most advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to the early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Association between gene expression levels and bone marrow blast proportion was tested, but only BIRC5 expression showed negative correlation (r=-0.83 at p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates stage-specific expression of some genes that may have potential prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
