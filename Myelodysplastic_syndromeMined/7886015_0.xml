<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variants such as hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological classification according to the FAB system corresponds with cytological classification, as proven by the distribution of the subtypes, blood values, leukemic transformation rates and survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies, which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
