<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell-cycle kinetics were measured in situ after infusions of iododeoxyuridine and/or bormodeoxyuridine in 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and the median labeling index in bone marrow (BM) biopsy samples was 28.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, 26 of 50 patients showed that &gt; or = 75% of hematopoietic cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lineages were undergoing programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) in their biopsy samples as shown by the in situ end labeling (ISEL) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had 1/3 and eight had 2/3 ISEL+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stromal cells were frequently ISEL+ and often S-phase cells were also found to be simultaneously ISEL+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nucleosomal DNA fragments as a ladder in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel were present in BM aspirates of four patients who showed high ISEL and were absent in two who had no ISEL staining in biopsy samples, but only when DNA was extracted after a 4-hour in vitro incubation in complete medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, laddering data confirmed the ISEL findings that the majority of hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are in early stages of PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that extensive intramedullary cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may explain the paradox of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> despite hypercellular marrows in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigating approaches that protect against PCD in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subsets would be of interest </plain></SENT>
