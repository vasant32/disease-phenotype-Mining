<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have screened genomic DNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells of 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) for mutations/deletions of exons 6, 13, 17, and 21 of the KIT gene (stem cell factor receptor) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography to detect single-stranded conformational polymorphisms (SSCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These exons include positions analogous to those mutated in the FMS gene (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and mutated/deleted in the Dominant <z:mp ids='MP_0002938'>White Spotting</z:mp> mouse (W locus) which results in macrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two different gel running conditions were used for each exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms were identified only at 4 degrees C in exon 17 (three out of 44 MDS samples and two of 21 DNA samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects), and in the non-coding region of exon 21 (five out of 34 MDS samples and seven out of 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing identified a G to A base change at nucleotide 3169 within exon 21, and a C to T change at position 2415 in exon 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No conformational changes suggestive of mutations or deletions have been found to date, although we cannot rule out low frequency clonal abnormalities undetectable by our method, which has a sensitivity in our hands of approximately 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms occur frequently in the KIT gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together with this study, a total of five have been described </plain></SENT>
