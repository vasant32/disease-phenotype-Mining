<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During these periods, the number of HSCT has been increasing, donor and stem cell sources were expanded, indication of diseases and patients for HSCT extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two HSCT units offered their data 1–6 times from July 2007 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual increase rates were 8.8% to 10.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matched sibling donor is 41%, mismatched related/haploidentical donor is 24%, unrelated volunteer donor is 16%, and umbilical cord blood is 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indications of major disease entities are <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphobastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, 25%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 21%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The different opinions on the indication of HSCT were supported by some trials, matched/haploidentical HSCT fit for middle or high risk ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first complete remission (CR1), the international prognosis score system (IPSS) — middle-II/high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in advanced stage and so on, when patients have no matched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, haploidentical HSCT has received a comparable result to matched simbling donor HSCT and unrelated matched donor HSCT; we suggest haploidentical donor might be a routine alternative donor for high-risk patents who need an urgent HSCT without matched related donor in special center </plain></SENT>
