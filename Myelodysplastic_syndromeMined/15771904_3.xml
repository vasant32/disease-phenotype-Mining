<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The up-to-date used criteria are the ones proposed by the French-American-British (FAB) group in 1982, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and a new, recently presented classification: categories cytology cytogenetics (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) system or 2003 WHO classification scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a technique that permits the detection of chromosomal imbalances within a "one step" analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, we present 5 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) analysis, we were able to detect DNA copy number alterations in 8 out of 9 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes were as follows: -7, -Y, del(5)(q33q34), del(11)(q22q24), del(5p), del(9)(q21q31), nullisomy X, and +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5/9 cases the HR-CGH data were highly comparable with conventional cytogenetics and interphase/metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 3 BM samples the HR-CGH revealed the presence of changes that had not been detected by conventional cytogenetics: del(5p), del(5)(q33q34), del(9)(q21q31), and nullisomy X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high effectiveness, specificity, and sensitivity of this method are in concordance with the conventional cytogenetics and FISH findings and the ability to detect new changes </plain></SENT>
