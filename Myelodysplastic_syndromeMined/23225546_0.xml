<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In search of new recurrent balanced translocations, we reviewed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) cytogenetics database containing pretreatment and relapse karyotypes of 4,701 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 565 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were treated on CALGB trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with balanced structural rearrangements occurring as a sole abnormality or in addition to one other abnormality, excluded abnormalities known to be recurrent, and then reviewed the literature to determine whether any of what we considered unique, previously unknown abnormalities had been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, we identified seven new recurrent balanced translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: t(7;11)(q22;p15.5), t(10;11)(q23;p15), t(2;12)(p13;p13), t(12;17)(p13;q12), t(2;3)(p21;p21), t(5;21)(q31;q22), and t(8;14)(q24.1;q32.2), and additionally, t(10;12)(p11;q15), a new translocation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> previously reported in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report hematologic and clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with these newly recognized recurrent translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also report 52 unique balanced translocations, together with the clinical data of patients harboring them, which to our knowledge have not been previously published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hope that once the awareness of their existence is increased, some of these translocations may become recognized as novel recurring abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of additional cases with both the new recurrent and the unique balanced translocations will enable determination of their prognostic significance and help to provide insights into the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in patients with these rare abnormalities </plain></SENT>
