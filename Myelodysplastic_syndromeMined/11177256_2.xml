<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were changes in the hemopoietic microenvironment in these patients: decreased cellularity of the bone marrow and impaired formation of sublayers in long-term bone marrow cultures, production of growth factors, maintaining the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte-macrophage precursors by stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction of macrophages in the stromal microenvironment was probably related to the presence of pathological macrophages./Abstract&gt; </plain></SENT>
