<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed 128 patients, aged 16 to 66 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 105) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 23) in a UD-HCT trial using RIC with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were transplanted with unmanipulated bone marrow (BM, n = 41) or mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (M-PB, n = 87) and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 26.7 months (range, 5.9-70.7 months) in surviving patients, 19 patients had died without progression/recurrence of underlying disease, giving a cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) of 17% (95% confidence interval, 11%-27%; 1-year TRM, 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graft failure (n = 7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (n = 5) were the most common causes of TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three patients died due to GVHD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, one; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Graft failure, which occurred in eight patients, showed a significant correlation with graft source (BM, 6/41 vs. M-PB, 2/87; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Donor-patient HLA-disparity did not correlate with GVHD, 1-year TRM, and graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIC containing antithymocyte globulin led to decreased GVHD-associated, as well as overall, TRM after UD-HCT </plain></SENT>
