<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jumping translocation (JT) is an unbalanced translocation that comprises amplified chromosomal segments jumping to various telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified a novel gene human JTB (Jumping Translocation Breakpoint) at 1q21, which fused with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case of JT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>JT results in a hJTB truncation, which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi> (Epidermal Differentiation Complex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report identifying the gene involved in unbalanced translocations at 1q21 </plain></SENT>
