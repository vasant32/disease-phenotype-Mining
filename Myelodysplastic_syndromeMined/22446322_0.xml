<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction-based feline XCIP analysis using the feline <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To construct the system of the analysis, polymorphism in CAG tandem repeats within the feline <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene was explored using somatic DNAs from 50 male and 103 female cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAG tandem repeats in exon 1 of the feline <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene were found to be polymorphic, containing 15 to 22 CAG repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 103 female cats, 70 (68%) were heterozygous for the number of CAG repeats, indicating the possible usefulness of XCIP analysis in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of the feline XCIP analysis to 3 feline <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary gland adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines revealed distinctly skewed XCIPs in these cell lines, indicating their clonal origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve (80%) of the 15 primary tissue/cell samples obtained from cats with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> showed skewed XCIPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, bone marrow samples from 3 cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were also found to have skewed XCIPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction-based XCIP analysis developed in this study can provide information on cell clonality in female cats, potentially facilitating the differential diagnosis of various disorders in cats </plain></SENT>
