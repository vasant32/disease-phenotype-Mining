<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The timing of transplantation, methods of disease risk stratification, patient selection, pretransplantation therapies, and preparative regimens have evolved over the years, resulting in increasing disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, alternative donor sources have been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to traditional sibling and matched unrelated donor stem cell sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efforts at transplantation regimen development continue with the aim of maximizing the chances of cure with minimal toxicity and improved quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Integrating new knowledge regarding disease biology will be critical to continue to improve the success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exciting areas of ongoing research that may lead to reductions in posttransplantation relapse rate include posttransplantation therapies such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, vaccine strategies, and donor lymphocyte infusions to enhance the GVL effect </plain></SENT>
