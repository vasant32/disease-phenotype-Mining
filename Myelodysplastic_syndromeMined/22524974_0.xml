<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated upregulation of c-myc, survivin, and cyclin D1 in CD34+ bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>). "Knockdown" of cyclin D1 by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cell growth, suggesting that this might be a therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed preclinical studies using BMMNCs from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> to examine the effects of the styryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35850">sulfone</z:chebi> ON 01910.Na on cyclin D1 accumulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and CD34+ blast percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We next treated twelve patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 AML patients with ON 01910.Na on a phase I clinical protocol (NCT00533416) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ON 01910.Na inhibited cyclin D1 expression, and was selectively toxic to <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry studies demonstrated increased mature CD15+ myeloid cells and decreased CD34+ blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients treated with ON 01910.Na on a clinical had decreased bone marrow blasts by â‰¥ 50%, and three patients had hematologic improvements, one of which was sustained for 33 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with hematologic responses to ON 01910.Na had decreased cyclin D1 expression in their CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The preclinical results and responses of patients on a clinical trial warrant further investigation of ON 01910.Na as a potential novel targeted therapy for higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
