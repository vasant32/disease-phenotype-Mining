<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated preweaned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prone Apc(Min/+) (Min) mice continuously with the DNA methylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> in their drinking water to determine the effects of the drug on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse development as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">Zebularine</z:chebi> caused a tissue-specific reduction in DNA methylation at B1 short interspersed nucleotide elements in the small and large intestines of female Min mice but not in other organs examined after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oral treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the average weights of mice was observed during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of global gene expression of colonic epithelial cells from the females indicated that only 3% to 6% of the genes were affected in their expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not detect toxicity and abnormalities from the histopathologic analysis of liver and intestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we tested whether prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> can be achieved with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> in Min mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in Min females decreased from 58 to 1, whereas the average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> number remained unaffected in Min males possibly due to differential activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results show for the first time that long-term oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> causes a gender-specific abrogation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> while causing a tissue-specific DNA demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, prolonged treatment of mice with epigenetic drugs resulted in only minor developmental and histologic changes </plain></SENT>
