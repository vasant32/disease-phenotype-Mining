<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies have identified the prognostic role of multiple demographic and clinical characteristics, the potential role of lifestyle factors has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we conducted an extensive assessment of the predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> survival, with a special focus on lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 616 patients (median survival = 4.1 years) were included in the analysis, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-smokers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who smoked at the initial clinical encounter had a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.46, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.07-2.00] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elevated risk was restricted to men (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.21-2.56) and not observed among women (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.51-1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients were stratified by the IPSS categorization, a near three fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with smoking among patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (HR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.48-5.39), whereas smoking did not appear to influence the survival of patients with intermediate- or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study was the first to identify smoking as a significant and independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> survival, particularly among low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
