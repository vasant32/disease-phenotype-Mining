<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case report, we will present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with multiple LCA of the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiomas</z:e> were observed in spleen during diagnostic abdominal ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She required a transfusion of one to two units of packed blood every 4-6 weeks and she eventually underwent a splenectomy in order to decrease the transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> improved after surgery, the patient did not achieve a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level in the two years following the splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following further studies, bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was undertaken and demonstrated minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in erythroid series including nuclear abnormalities, irregular cytoplasmic borders and irregular staining of the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As LCA of the spleen and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> may both cause cytopenia their co-existence may complicate the clinical presentation leading to an incomplete or inappropriate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
