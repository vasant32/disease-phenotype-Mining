<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several genetic/epigenetic abnormalities are deeply associated with the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although bone marrow (BM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is a common strategy to obtain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells for evaluating their genetic/epigenetic abnormalities, BM <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is difficult to perform repeatedly to obtain serial samples because of pain and safety concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that circulating cell-free DNAs from plasma and serum of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be used to detect genetic/epigenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma DNA concentration was found to be relatively high in patients with higher blast cell counts in BM, and accumulation of DNA fragments from mono-/di-nucleosomes was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using serial peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients treated with hypomethylating agents, global methylation analysis using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing was performed at the specific CpG sites of the LINE-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed a decrease of the methylation percentage after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (days 3-9) using DNAs from plasma, serum, and PB mono-nuclear cells (PBMNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma DNA tends to show more rapid change at days 3 and 6 compared with serum DNA and PBMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the TET2 gene mutation in DNAs from plasma, serum, and BM cells was quantitated by pyrosequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The existence ratio of mutated genes in plasma and serum DNA showed almost equivalent level with that in the CD34+/38- stem cell population in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that genetic/epigenetic analyses using PB circulating DNA can be a safer and painless alternative to using BM cells </plain></SENT>
