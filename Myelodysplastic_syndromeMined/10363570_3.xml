<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF or placebo was given subcutaneously once daily at a dose of 250 microg/m2, starting 48 h prior to chemotherapy, and continued until neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to high toxicity and slow patient recruitement the study was closed and unblinded after 31 patients had been enrolled; 15 were randomized to receive placebo and 16 to receive GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 patients were evaluable for response; their median age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients achieved a complete remission (34.5%), 9 patients had persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (31%), 10 patients died within 6 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) (34.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median remission duration was 190 days (range: 2.5-45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 29 evaluable patients no significant differences could be found between the two study arms regarding complete remission rate [GM-CSF: 31% (5/16) versus placebo: 38% (5/13) P = 0.45], rate of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [GM-CSF: 25% (4/16) versus 38% (5/13) P = 0.35), early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate [44% (7/16) versus 23% (3/13) P = 0.22] and remission duration (GM-CSF: 87 days versus placebo 221 days) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The small number of patients finally analyzed means that no definite conclusions about the effect of GM-CSF can be reached </plain></SENT>
