<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it would be helpful to identify likely responders and nonresponders before initiating treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that high pretreatment endogenous erythropoietin levels are associated with a lower response to erythropoietin, especially in certain patient groups, such as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, non-chemotherapy patients, or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various algorithms have therefore been developed to predict patient response to rHuEPO using baseline serum erythropoietin levels and other baseline factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed an analysis of data pooled from four randomized clinical trials of 604 patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, examining the clinical usefulness of pretreatment and early treatment factors for predicting response to erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis confirms several other reports that the most predictive models combined pretreatment and early treatment factors, including change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> at 4 weeks, but even these models did not increase sensitivity above 85% (total response in unselected patients was 68.1%), while specificity remained poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that clinically useful prediction of response to erythropoietin is not possible using baseline or early response variables because of poor sensitivity and specificity of prediction compared with generally accepted clinical tests </plain></SENT>
