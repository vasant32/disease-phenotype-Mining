<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the myelosuppressive TGF-β pathway is constitutively activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because there is conflicting data about upregulation of extracellular TGF-β levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we wanted to determine the molecular basis of TGF-β pathway overactivation and consequent hematopoietic suppression in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that SMAD7, a negative regulator of TGF-β receptor I (TBRI) kinase, is markedly decreased in a large meta-analysis of gene expression studies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow-derived CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMAD7 protein was also found to be significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow progenitors when examined immunohistochemically in a bone marrow tissue microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of SMAD7 in hematopoietic cells led to increased TGF-β-mediated gene transcription and enhanced sensitivity to TGF-β-mediated suppressive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased TGF-β signaling due to SMAD7 reduction could be effectively inhibited by a novel clinically relevant TBRI (ALK5 kinase) inhibitor, LY-2157299 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LY-2157299 could inhibit TGF-β-mediated SMAD2 activation and hematopoietic suppression in primary hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vivo administration of LY-2157299 ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in a TGF-β overexpressing transgenic mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, treatment with LY-2157199 stimulated hematopoiesis from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that reduction in SMAD7 is a novel molecular alteration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that leads to ineffective hematopoiesis by activating of TGF-β signaling in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies also illustrate the therapeutic potential of TBRI inhibitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
