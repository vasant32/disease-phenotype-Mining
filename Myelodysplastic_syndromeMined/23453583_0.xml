<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare two dosing regimens of tosedostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomised phase 2 study, patients aged 60 years or older with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that had relapsed after a first complete remission lasting less than 12 months, or had achieved no previous complete remission, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive as first salvage tosedostat 120 mg once daily for 6 months or 240 mg once daily for 2 months followed by 120 mg for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was by block method via an interactive web response system using a randomisation schedule generated by an external vendor, with no stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was open label </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who obtained a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one oral dose of tosedostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00780598 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 38 patients were randomly assigned to receive tosedostat 120 mg and 38 to receive the tosedostat 240 mg to 120 mg regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>38 patients in the 120 mg group and 35 in the 240 mg to 120 mg group received tosedostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (10%) had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery: two (5%) in the 120 mg group and five (14%) in the 240 mg to 120 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (11 [29%] patients in the 120 mg group and ten [29%] of the 240 mg to 120 mg group), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (eight [21%] and eight [23%] patients), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (seven [18%] and eight [23%] patients), dyspnoea (five [13%] and seven [20%] patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (four [11%] and six [17%] patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were five fatal adverse events deemed to be treatment-related: three in the 120 mg group and two in the 240 mg to 120 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Tosedostat, at either dose schedule, has activity in older patients with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additional studies of tosedostat including combination with hypomethylating agents and low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are ongoing or planned </plain></SENT>
