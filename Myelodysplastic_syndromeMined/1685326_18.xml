<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene deletion studies were performed on the granulocyte and T-lymphocyte fractions of six women with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and either a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six showed gene loss in the granulocyte but not the T-lymphocyte fractions, indicating monoclonality of the granulocytes but not the T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to further investigate this finding, we subsequently performed X-RFLP-methylation studies using the probe M27 beta, and also a probe for the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies have confirmed the monoclonality of the granulocytes and the polyclonality of the T-lymphocytes in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that in this group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the T-lymphocytes were not involved in the disorder, and furthermore, in the one case where B-lymphocytes were also available, that the progenitor cell of origin was restricted to the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
