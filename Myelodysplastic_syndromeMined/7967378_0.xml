<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated several methods for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> estimation to standardize simple and reliable techniques for identifying MDR1 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> in large scale studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blot detection of MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio under the conventional conditions, that was improved mainly by removing unincorporated radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of MDR1 transcripts on positive cells was estimated less than 10% of that of constitutive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A modified method seemed useful in estimating the total amount of the MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in a whole leukemic cell population, and suitable to study stock samples or for large prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was more sensitive in detecting MDR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than Northern blot analysis, and the very feature made it virtually impossible to exclude contamination with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023487" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="APML">FAB M3</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were essentially MDR1 negative, and there existed frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> subpopulation which had excessive MDR1 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled phosphorothioate oligonucleotide probe was visualized using flowcytometry or con-focus lightmicroscopy, enabled us to recognize the difference between multidrug resistant K562/ADM and its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
