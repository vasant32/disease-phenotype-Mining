<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed multivariate analyses using data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to identify risk factors for NRM and survival in 1117 pediatric subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, transplanted from related donors, unrelated donors (URD), or unrelated cord blood between 1995 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 4 variables associated with higher NRM: HLA partially matched or mismatched URD, peripheral blood cell graft, Karnofsky/Lansky score &lt; 80 at cGVHD diagnosis, and platelets &lt; 100 × 10(9)/L at cGVHD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with significantly worse survival were: age &gt; 10 years, transplantation from HLA partially matched or mismatched URD, advanced disease at transplantation, Karnofsky/Lansky &lt; 80; and platelets &lt; 100 × 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of discontinuation of systemic immune suppression at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis of cGVHD were 22% (20%-25%), 34% (31%-37%), and 37% (34%-40%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the largest study elucidating variables affecting outcome after diagnosis of cGVHD in pediatric allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These variables may be useful for risk stratification, development of future clinical trials, and family counseling in children with cGVHD </plain></SENT>
