<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e> has been recorded as being associated with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, concurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> has not been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We report on four children aged 23, 25, 26, and 53 months with multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e> with organ dysfunction (bone marrow and liver) whose bone marrow pictures, taken at diagnosis, revealed the presence of myelodysplastic abnormalities (RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We suggest that the commonly used expression of "organ dysfunction," which refers to clinical and functional alterations, could be explained by a myelodysplastic-like disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The contemporary presence of both events may provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e>, especially in young children with multisystem disease and organ dysfunction, who are known to have a very poor outcome </plain></SENT>
