<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recurrent deletions of 5q in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> encompass two separate regions: deletion of 5q33, which is associated with the 5qâˆ’ syndrome and haploinsufficiency of RPS14, and deletion of a more proximal locus at 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case with a cryptic 1.3 Mb deletion in 5q31.2 identified by array comparative genomic hybridization that places the proximal boundary of the deletion proximal and close to the candidate EGR1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed initially with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, with a del(20)(q11.2q13.3) as the sole abnormality identified by karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with no change to the G-banded karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1.3 Mb deletion on the long arm of one chromosome 5 was confirmed to have been present both at presentation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and at transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is an interesting case because there are few array studies identifying cryptic 5q deletions, and the study of these small deletions helps to refine the common deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case, together with previously published studies, suggests that the proximal boundary of the common deleted region may lie within the KDM3B gene </plain></SENT>
