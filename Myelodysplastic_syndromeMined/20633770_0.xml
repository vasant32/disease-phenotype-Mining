<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present an unusual cytogenetic abnormality leading to loss of both the whole short and whole long arms of chromosome 7, which was found in the bone marrow cells of three pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of conventional and molecular cytogenetic methods, a tiny "dot-like" marker chromosome was found and described as der(7)del(7)(p11)del(7)(q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Together with one previously published case, this chromosomal aberration represents a new rare recurrent karyotypic abnormality involving chromosome 7 in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
