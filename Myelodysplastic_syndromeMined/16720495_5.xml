<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the causes and outcome in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin (FUO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 1999, 185 children with FUO were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial evaluation included routine haematological analysis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology, urine, stool or blood cultures, chest X-ray and tuberculin probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 131 (70%) patients diagnosis was established, and 70 (37.8%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visceral leishmaniasis</z:e> (VL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> were diagnosed in 24 (12.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> in 12 (6.4%), malignant diseases in 12 (6.4%) and miscellaneous conditions in 15 (8.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 54 (30%) patients, diagnosis was not established and most of them had self-limited disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the investigation, 26 (14%) patients developed serious organ dysfunction and five patients (two with virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024291" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophagocytic syndrome</z:e>, one with VL and two unknown) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most important infectious causes of FUO in our study were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and VL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> represented a significant cause of FUO at the beginning of our study because it was not recognized by primary-care physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We report <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> as another emerging cause of paediatric FUO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeated clinical examination and careful use of specific laboratory examinations, invasive diagnostic procedures or imaging are crucial in approaching paediatric FUO </plain></SENT>
