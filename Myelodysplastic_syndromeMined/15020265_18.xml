<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether deletions of known suppressor sequences occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> associated with 5q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were selected for the presence of a 5q karyotypic deletion, either isolated (19 cases) or associated with other chromosome changes (11 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei was applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases using a panel of eleven probes for known suppressor genes or loci deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metaphase FISH was also performed to clarify discrepancies between conventional and molecular cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No additional deletions were found in nineteen cases with an isolated 5q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mono-allelic deletions where found in 9/11 cases, 3 of which were related to <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interphase-FISH showed p53, AML1, D13S25, NF1, or Ikaros in six out of nine (66%) patients with 5q- and additional karyotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metaphase FISH was helpful in assigning some of these cryptic events to non-proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes that isolated 5q- is the marker of a highly stable clone in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with isolated 5q- are molecularly closer to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> than to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with complex changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interphase-FISH data strongly support a mutator phenotype underlying complex karyotypes with a 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
