<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the distribution of bone marrow findings in such cases of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in a tertiary academic medical center, we evaluated 250 recent bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed in the setting of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in patients without previously diagnosed hematologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 250 bone marrow studies, 193 were performed in adults and 57 were performed in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In children, the most prevalent bone marrow finding was B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, followed by nonspecific changes attributed clinically to a variety of factors including multifactorial, autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adults, hematologic neoplastic causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> were the most prevalent diagnoses, with the cases divided mostly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, with fewer numbers of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many bone marrow findings demonstrated nonspecific changes that were attributed clinically to a variety of etiologies such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, multifactorial causes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo>, drugs, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, in both the pediatric and the adult population, new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was most commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> differed by age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although in most cases, a definitive diagnosis could be made based solely on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy interpretation, a significant fraction of cases in both children and adults demonstrated nonspecific marrow findings that required clinical follow-up and/or repeat biopsy for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
