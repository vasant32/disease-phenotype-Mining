<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes 24 children with tMDS/tAML who were assigned randomly to standard- or intensive-timing induction on protocol CCG 2891 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting features and outcomes of those children were compared with those of 960 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (62 patients) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (898 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children with tMDS/tAML were older at presentation (P =.015), had lower white blood cell counts (P =.01), and were more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (21% vs 7%) (P =.02) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (P =.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fewer had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> (P =.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> (P =.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> (P =.02), or classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> translocations [t(8;21), t(15;17), 16q22; P =.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had a poorer induction rate (50% vs 72%, P =.016), overall survival (26% vs 47% at 3 years, P =.007), and event-free survival (21% vs 39% at 3 years, P =.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival after achieving remission was similar (45% vs 53%, P =.868) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with tMDS/tAML who received intensive-timing induction had better outcomes than those who received standard-timing induction (overall survival 32% vs 0%, P =.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, the latency period to development of tMDS/tAML was the same for presumed alkylator-induced as for topoisomerase-induced myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study confirm that most children with tMDS/tAML have disease resistant to current therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Standard-timing induction appears less effective for this population </plain></SENT>
