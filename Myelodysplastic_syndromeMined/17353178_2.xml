<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, the detection of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality has a major role in difficult cases in regard to diagnosis and the recognition of morphological cytogenetic correlates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to assess the frequency and characteristic type of abnormal clones when it is not clear whether or not a hematological condition is neoplastic, cytogenetics have been analyzed necessarily in 159 patients with unexplained cytopenia or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 14 patients (8.8%) with cytogenetic abnormalities in the absence of concomitant dysplastic features of the marrow at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic changes were characteristic of those reported for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>: 3 del(20q), 2 Y chromosome losses, 2 del(5q), 2 11q23 abnormalities, and one each of t(3;5), i(7q), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, and del(13q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of ring chromosome 4 was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few months later, 3 of these patients showed marrow changes consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that a significant proportion of otherwise uncertain diagnoses presented abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up will be required to help determine the malignant potential of these clones </plain></SENT>
