<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Values for plasma iron turnover, marrow iron turnover, and erythron transferrin uptake were derived using two ferrokinetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One entailed analysis of the extended plasma iron clearance over a number of days, the other comprised analysis of the initial plasma iron clearance during the first few hours of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was found between the variables quantifying total erythropoiesis (marrow iron turnover and erythron transferrin uptake) in the two methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional classifications produced by both models and based on the values for plasma iron turnover, marrow iron turnover, and erythron transferrin uptake were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both models identified functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and functional homogeneity within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each method produced comparable data on erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main reason for analysing the extended plasma iron clearance is to differentiate levels of effective and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short analysis presents the practical advantages associated with a one-day study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could be further enhanced if the level of effective erythropoiesis could be clearly defined </plain></SENT>
