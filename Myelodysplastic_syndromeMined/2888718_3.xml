<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> prepared from purified factor 13B (F13B) was sequenced, and a single, long oligonucleotide corresponding to its cognate DNA sequence was constructed and used to screen a chromosome 7 specific genomic library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The positive clone isolated, designated pKV13, was only related to F13B at the oligonucleotide region, but has proved to be a valuable chromosome 7 marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>pKV13 maps to 7pter-q22 in hybrid cell lines, and is present in a chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT) cell line that also contains met and other 7q probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>pKV13 defines a common MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and is genetically linked to two markers on the long arm of chromosome 7, B79a and COLIA2, both themselves linked to the cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analysis demonstrates that KV13 maps centromeric to both B79a and COLIA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>pKV13 has been used to demonstrate the existence of rearrangements within CMGT hybrids, and will also prove valuable in multipoint linkage studies of other 7q markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, pKV13 provides a new polymorphic locus for the characterisation of 7q deletions in myeloid disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
