<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a retrospective analysis of 128 consecutive patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who received an alemtuzumab-based reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic SCT (RIC HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median recipient age was 53 years (range 21-72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 (38%) recipients had a sibling donor and 79 (62%) had a volunteer-unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) was assigned to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a score of 0 in 40 (31%), of 1-2 in 45 (35%) and &gt;or=3 in 43 (34%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 31%, disease-free survival (DFS) was 41% and overall survival (OS) was 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year NRM for patients with a HCT-CI score of 0, 1-2 or &gt;or=3 was 16, 24 and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year DFS and OS by HCT-CI was 58 and 69% (score 0), 39 and 39% (score 1-2) and 24 and 32% (score &gt;or=3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, HCT-CI was an independent variable affecting 3-year NRM, DFS and OS (P-value=0.04, 0.01 and &lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the disease stage at the time of transplant was an additional independent predictive variable on transplant outcomes, recipient age (&gt;or&lt;50 years) did not have a significant predictive impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with advanced disease receiving alemtuzumab-based RIC HSCT, the HCT-CI provides an important means of stratifying patients with a high risk of inferior transplant outcomes </plain></SENT>
