<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sugar chains of the hydrolases undergo post-translational processing which is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) at the first step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we estimated serum GlcNAc-phosphotransferase in 50 adults suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was increased to moderate or high levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, suggesting that the serum transferase is released from leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In many cases of ANLL examined, activity of the transferase was decreased concomitantly with reduction of peripheral blastic cells by effective chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
