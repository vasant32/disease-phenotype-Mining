<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The significance of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied TdT expression by flow cytometry in 120 previously untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to determine the distribution of TdT-positive blasts and the intensity of TdT expression and to seek clinically significant associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TdT expression measured by flow cytometry (flow TdT%) was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, ranging from 0.1% to 87% (median, 8.5%), and 74 patients (62%) had at least 5% TdT-positive blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TdT positivity was associated with the M0 or M1 subtype and with expression of CD34 and CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between TdT expression and type of cytogenetic abnormality or rearrangement of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission lasted longer in patients with a flow TdT% &lt; 5 than in patients with a flow TdT% &gt; 5 (median, 95 weeks vs 55 weeks, p = 0.02); however, complete remission rates did not differ when patients were classified by initial flow TdT% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was slightly better for patients with flow TdT% less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a flow TdT% &gt; 5%, those with a higher TdT intensity survived longer than those with a lower intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that quantitative TdT measurement may contribute to prognostic estimate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
