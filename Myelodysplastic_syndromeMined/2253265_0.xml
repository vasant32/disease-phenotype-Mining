<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of 60 years of our patients is by 5-10 years lower than of groups reported abroad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our group and in the majority of groups abroad refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> predominates over "preleukaemic" types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> is obviously a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group from the diagnostic aspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> there is marked agreement as regards survival of different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> starting with the longest survival of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, via RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and finally the lowest survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic classification is thus to a certain extent also the prognosis of the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transformation into AL (in 22% in our group) belongs to groups with a lower incidence of AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless more than 50% of the patients do not die from AL but from the sequelae of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> (in the authors' group 13% patients, most frequently after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi>) is mentioned in groups reported abroad only in one quarter of the papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of chromosomal aberrations in our group is one of the highest in the world and along with the low average age of our patients is an alarming finding </plain></SENT>
