<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restoration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> sensitivity can potentially improve treatment outcome in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acquired hypermethylation of gene promoters and associated silencing of gene expression has been implicated in chemo resistance, and drug-induced hypomethylation can improve sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted an adaptively randomized study of a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, a hypomethylating agent, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in 34 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination administered in a concomitant fashion is safe at full doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, without unexpected toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in this advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> population, it was difficult to deliver more than one cycle of therapy, and minimal anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> activity was seen in patients with relapsed/refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was achieved in 2 of 6 minimally pre-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> is feasible but has limited activity in relapsed/refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
