<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression of Thy-1 (CD90) antigen on CD34+ bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) obtained from 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by two-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five of nine patients (55.6%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and two of 16 (12.5%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) showed more than 20% of Thy-1 expression of their CD34+ BMMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding chromosomal abnormalities, -5/5q- or -18 might be correlated with the expression of Thy-1 on CD34+ BMMNC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were analyzed twice, once before and once after leukemic transformation and showed no significant change in Thy-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that Thy-1 was expressed on CD34+ BMMNC in certain patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> before leukemic transformation and that it was maintained during the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of Thy-1 did not seem essential to the leukemic transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> though the patients with high Thy-1 expression might have poorer prognosis compared with those with low Thy-1 expression </plain></SENT>
