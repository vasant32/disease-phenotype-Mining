<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not yet clear whether the sAML/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a consequence of a standard therapeutic regimen, applied before transplantation, or a high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a female patient with initially resistant form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> at III-B-b clinical stadium (bulky disease in neck and mediastinum) after the initial treatment (MOPPx4; ABVDx3; BEA-COPPx2), high-dose chemotherapy has been applied according to BEAM protocol with autologous SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a period after transplantation, radiotherapy (RT) has been applied at initial region of the disease and a patient reached complete remission (CR), which lasted for a 27 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of more standard therapeutic cycles and characteristic cytogenetic findings are the facts that support the opinion that sAML/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a consequence of standard treatment before transplantation, rather than high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That finding implies the need for correct choice of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients suitable for early SCT therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
