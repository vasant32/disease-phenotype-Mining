<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the chemotherapy and radiation used for the preparation of BMT can induce late effects which can be rather severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially in malignant diseases the late toxicity of previous conventional therapy has an additional impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The function of various organs can be impaired, such as the eyes, the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, the teeth, the legs, the heart, the kidneys, the liver, the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> functions and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> occur during various times after BMT: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> may occur during the first year, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> develop after several years, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> occur even later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> after BMT seems to be higher in children than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many late sequelae as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849888" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological disturbances</z:e> can impair the quality of life of the survivors of BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paediatricians should take this fact into account when they think about stem cell transplantation in a child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> means that a long-term observation in these persons is necessary and this is done best within a standardised follow-up programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile such programmes have been developed in some countries, and this should be promoted within the working party 'Paediatric Diseases' of EBMT </plain></SENT>
