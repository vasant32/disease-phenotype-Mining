<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There has been little survival improvement in older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in the last two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improving induction treatment may improve the rate and quality of remission and consequently survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our previous trial, in younger patients, we showed improved survival for the majority of patients when adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) to induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (median age, 67 years; range, 51 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/ara-C or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/clofarabine, with (n = 559) or without (n = 556) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> 3 mg/m(2) on day 1 of course one of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 69% (complete remission [CR], 60%; CR with incomplete recovery [CRi], 9%), with no difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> (70%) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> (68%) arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in 30- or 60-day mortality and no major increase in toxicity with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With median follow-up of 30 months (range, 5.5 to 54.6 months), 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> (68% v 76%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P = .007), and 3-year survival was significantly better (25% v 20%; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The benefit was apparent across subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no interaction with other treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of 2,228 patients in two United Kingdom National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Institute trials showed significant improvements in relapse (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P = .002) and OS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.98; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> (3 mg/m(2)) to induction chemotherapy reduces relapse risk and improves survival with little increase in toxicity </plain></SENT>
