<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 13 was detected in 55% of CD34+ cells and in 5.5% of CD19+ cells, the latter being comparable to the negative control specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome inactivation showed both CD34+ and CD19+ cells to be monoclonal, though their inactivated X-chromosome was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results strongly suggested that both populations of CD34+ and CD19+ cells have originated from a different progenitor stem cell </plain></SENT>
