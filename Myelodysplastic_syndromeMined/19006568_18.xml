<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was originally described in a three-generation family with five affected members that had an L270P mutation in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-ase binding domain (GBD) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> protein (WASP) [Devriendt et al (2001) Nature Genetics, Vol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>27, 313-317] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report and describe a large three-generation family with XLN, with 10 affected males and eight female carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A c.882T&gt;C mutation was identified in the WAS gene, resulting in an I294T mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infectious course is variable and mild in view of the profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the original description, low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgA levels, low to low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts and reduced natural killer (NK)-cell counts also appear as consistent XLN features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, inverted CD4/CD8 ratios were not found in this family, nor were cases identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female carriers exhibited a variable attenuated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Like L270P WASP, I294T WASP is constitutively active towards actin polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this largest XLN kindred identified to date provides new independent genetic evidence that mutations disrupting the auto-inhibitory GBD of WASP are the cause of XLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reduced NK cells, low to low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts and low to low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgA levels are also features of XLN </plain></SENT>
