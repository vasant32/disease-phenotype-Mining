<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By in situ chromosomal hybridization, the GM-CSF and FMS genes were localized to human chromosome 5 at bands q23 to q31, and at band 5q33, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These genes encode proteins involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, and are located within a chromosome region frequently deleted in patients with neoplastic myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both genes were deleted in the 5q-chromosome from bone marrow cells of two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and a del(5)(q15q33.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF gene alone was deleted in a third patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) who has a smaller deletion, del(5)(q22q33.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> cells from a fourth patient who has ANLL and does not have a del(5q), but who has a rearranged chromosome 5 that is missing bands q31.3 to q33.1 [ins(21;5)(q22;q31.3q33.1)] were used to sublocalize these genes; both genes were present on the rearranged chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the deletion of one or both of these genes may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or of ANLL </plain></SENT>
