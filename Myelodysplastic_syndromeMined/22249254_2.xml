<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They display exaggerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in early stages, but lose this behavior during evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate this critical event, we analyzed phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'kinase signaling, implicated as a critical pathway of cell survival control in epithelial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PI 3'kinase activates Akt through its production of 3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In turn, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> are dephosphorylated by two <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP-1, in myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-enriched bone marrow cells and bone marrow sections by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR for components of the SHIP/PTEN/PI 3'kinase signaling circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We reported constitutively activated Akt, variable levels of PTEN and uniformly decreased SHIP-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SHIP-1, but not the phosphatase-deficient form, inhibited myeloid leukemic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of microRNA (miR)-210 and miR-155 transcripts, which target SHIP-1, were increased in CD34(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells compared with their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Direct binding of miR-210 to the 3' untranslated region of SHIP-1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transfection of a myeloid cell line with miR-210 resulted in loss of SHIP-1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that miR-155 and miR-210/SHIP-1/Akt pathways could serve as clinical biomarkers for disease progression, and that miR-155 and miR-210 might serve as novel therapeutic targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
