<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm the clinical efficacy of this regimen and determine its feasibility in a multicenter study that includes both academic and community-based practices, a phase II study of this regimen was conducted by SWOG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced stage, previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 57.4 years (35-69.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (39%) did not complete the full scheduled course of treatment due to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and two cases of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
