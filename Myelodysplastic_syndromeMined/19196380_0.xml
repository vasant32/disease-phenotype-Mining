<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This abnormality occurs early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> and seems to be associated with poor prognosis in myelodsplastic syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of more inactivated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes contributing to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may lead to further elucidation of the biology of this disease and help to identify novel targets for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the methylation status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) gene promoter was analyzed by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow (BM) samples from 59 patients with different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormal methylation of the DAPK1 gene was found in 37 of 59 (62.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation was significant between the sex and the methylation status of DAPK1 promoter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (R=0.332, P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, methylation status of DAPK1 promoter was associated with the percentage of BM blasts (R=0.346, P=0.010) and International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS) groups (R=0.278, P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated 50% survival time of the methylated DAPK1 group and unmethylated group was 20 and 33 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between these two groups (chi2=0.652, P=0.419) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified the age older than 50 years, the Int-2/high-risk categories of IPSS and the advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e>) in WHO classification as negative prognostic factors (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
