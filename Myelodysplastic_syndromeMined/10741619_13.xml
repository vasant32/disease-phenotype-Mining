<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluated patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and 100-day transplant-related mortality in 288 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transplanted without isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were allowed out of hospital at any time within constraints of the medication schedule </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> occurred in 57% of patients, and 10% had a clinical or radiographic focus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were apparently endogenous; blood cultures from 24% of recipients grew organisms, 87% of which were <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (1%) died with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillus infection</z:e> in circumstances indicating that isolation would not have been helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent of patients remained without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality at 100 days was 1% for 108 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> receiving transplants from matched siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients at higher risk, by virtue of donor and/or disease status, mortality was 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These figures compare favorably with those reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, the majority of patients having been subjected to some form of isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be safely performed in some environments without confining patients continuously to the hospital </plain></SENT>
