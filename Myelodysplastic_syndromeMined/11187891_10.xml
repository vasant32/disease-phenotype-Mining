<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is the cause of marrow failure in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, ICE) and caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain) in marrow mononuclear cells, and the growth pattern of committed progenitors in a series of 83 MDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of apoptotic cells as detected by TUNEL technique, and the percentage of caspase-3-positive cells were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous growth of CFU-GM was associated with a higher percentage of blasts, and with a lower expression of caspase-3 and caspase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The yield of CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GM (in the presence of growth factors) was decreased by comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, but large individual differences were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytological categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of caspase-1 and caspase-3 activities by specific inhibitors resulted in a significant increase of the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of colonies (up to 50-fold of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor, the number of BFU-E and CFU-E was in the range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in most cases of RA and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, caspase-1 and -3 protease activities were detectable by fluorogenic assay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of caspase-3, including the cleaved (activated)-p17 form in most cases of RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that caspase-3 is implicated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that inhibition of its activity can restore at least partially the growth of committed progenitors </plain></SENT>
