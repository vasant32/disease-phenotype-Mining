<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the early complications is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the number of active lymphocytes in the patient's blood stream after bone marrow transplantation and the development of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction or rejection of the graft, and thus contribute towards prediction or diagnosis of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (2) and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (2) bone marrow was transplanted: the donor was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances a HLA identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only 11 patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the latter changes in the number of circulating active lymphocytes were assessed: their activity was evaluated from nucleolar characteristics expressed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their values at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction (GVHD) varied between 7.4% and 17.3%; at the time when these patients were free from complications they were 2.2%-6.0% (the difference is at the borderline of significance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients the rise of active lymphocytes preceded the manifestation of the graft versus host reaction by 3-7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of infectious complications after bone marrow transplantation (temperatures of obscure origin, herpetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, varicella, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851887" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adenoviral infections</z:e>) the number of active lymphocytes did not increase (2.0%-10.0%), as compared with 3.4%-9.5% in the group without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased percentage of activated lymphocytes in the peripheral blood stream of patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction (GVHD) after bone marrow transplantation results from specific immunological procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their assessment could help with the differential diagnostic difficulties frequently associated with the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction </plain></SENT>
