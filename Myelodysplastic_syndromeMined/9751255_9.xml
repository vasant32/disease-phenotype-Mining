<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both polymorphisms are due to gene deletions, which are responsible for the existence of null genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene defect of GSTT1 has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lack of GSTM1 was associated with tobacco smoke-induced lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined whether the GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 homozygous null genotypes were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GSTT1 null genotype was observed in 14% of the control subjects that had never suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> (n = 115) and in 16% of the patients affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> (n = 103, OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.39-1.92, P = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lack of GSTM1 was observed in 38% of the control subjects and in 46% of the patients (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was not significant (P = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no significant differences were obtained if GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 null genotypes were analyzed in subgroups of control subjects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> patients between the ages of 20-40, 41-70 and 71-90 years and in individuals with a positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 null genotypes were not significantly associated with the histologic type and grade or FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stages of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GSTT1 and/or GSTM1 null genotypes are not markers for an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
