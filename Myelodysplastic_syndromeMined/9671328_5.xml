<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As only approximately 50% of unselected anemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients respond sufficiently to epoetin alfa treatment, careful patient selection according to reliable prediction criteria is of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predictions of response to epoetin alfa treatment are based either on the degree of blunted erythropoietin response to the anemic condition or on indicators of responsiveness during the early treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most accurate predictions of responsiveness, however, are derived from combinations of predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combinations of synergistically acting hematopoietic growth factors, particularly epoetin alfa and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, are beneficial to selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and may prolong survival in certain cases </plain></SENT>
