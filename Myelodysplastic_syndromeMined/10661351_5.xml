<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The occurrence of extraosseous Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (ES) in deep soft tissues has been well described, but cases in which this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> occurs in a primary cutaneous or subcutaneous site have rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The superficial variant may be less aggressive than are the more common bony and deep soft tissue counterparts with an apparently favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of patients with cutaneous or subcutaneous ES was conducted to analyze outcome and patterns of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between July 1985 and March 1997, 14 patients with cutaneous or subcutaneous ES were treated at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jude Children's Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was 16 years (range 7-21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anatomic locations included trunk and pelvis (7), upper or lower extremity (4), and head and neck (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median size of the lesion was 3 cm (range, 1-12 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen had definitive surgical resections, and one had biopsy of the mass at the time of referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were enrolled on institutional (12) or cooperative group (2) protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received chemotherapy, composed of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and dactinomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients on institutional protocols received radiation (36 Gy) to the operative bed (150-180 cGy/fraction/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative radiotherapy was omitted for 2 patients who had complete resection on the cooperative group study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had wide local excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> prior to enrollment on chemotherapy; surgical margins were negative (10), microscopically positive (2), and indeterminate (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients received radiotherapy to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bed; 2 with clear surgical margins were treated without irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient who had biopsy only received induction chemotherapy followed by definitive surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 77 months (range 17-111 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>None of the patients has developed local recurrence or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Several of the patients developed treatment-related sequelae, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> of the lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1), chemotherapy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian failure</z:e> (1), moist desquamation (1), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002037'>dermatofibroma</z:mp> within the radiotherapy volumes (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous and subcutaneous ES are associated with an indolent course and a favorable prognosis when treated with combined modality therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Elimination of radiation therapy following complete resection has been tested in the POG 9354 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The high rate of local control, low rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, and excellent overall outcome may suggest a role for less intensive chemotherapy, as well as tailoring to diminish or avoid radiation therapy in completely resected cases, with a goal to minimize toxicity while maintaining a high cure rate </plain></SENT>
