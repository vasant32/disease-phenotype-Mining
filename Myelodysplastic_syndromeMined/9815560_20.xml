<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the impact of these two agents on lineage- and differentiation stage-specific antigen expression, proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and clonogenic cell survival in primary cultures of bone marrow samples from patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> at presentation and in remission and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PB inhibited the proliferation of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cells in suspension culture with an ID50 of 6.6 mM, similar to its ED50 in cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At higher doses (&gt;/=5 mM), PB also induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PB inhibited clonogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell growth with a median ID50 of less than 2 mM; however, colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were inhibited with a similar ID50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to PB, its metabolite PA had no significant effect on either <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> proliferation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the monocytic marker CD14 was increased in monocytic and myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in response to PB, and to a lesser extent, PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, both agents appeared to increase expression of the progenitor cell antigen CD34, as well as the DR locus of the human leukocyte antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that PB, but not its metabolite PA, has significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> and differentiating activity against primary neoplastic myeloid cells at doses that may be achievable clinically </plain></SENT>
