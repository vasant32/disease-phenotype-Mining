<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The highest approved dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> is currently 30 mg/kg per d in many countries; however, some patients require escalation above 30 mg/kg per d to achieve their therapeutic goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis investigated the efficacy (based on change in serum ferritin levels) and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> &gt;30 mg/kg per d in adult and paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 264 patients pooled from four clinical trials received doses of &gt;30 mg/kg per d; median exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> &gt;30 mg/kg per d was 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the overall population there was a statistically significant median decrease in serum ferritin of 440 microg/l (P &lt; 0.0001) from pre-dose-escalation to the time-of-analysis; significant decreases were also observed in adult and paediatric patients, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adverse event profile in patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> doses of &gt;30 mg/kg per d was consistent with previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no worsening of renal or liver function following dose escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> &gt;30 mg/kg per d effectively reduced iron burden to levels lower than those achieved prior to dose escalation in patients with transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for patients who are heavily transfused and may require higher doses to reduce body iron burden </plain></SENT>
