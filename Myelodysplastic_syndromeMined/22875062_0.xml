<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, none of them includes their simultaneous analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated relative expression levels of 14 molecular markers in 193 peripheral blood samples from untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detectable WT1 expression levels, low TET2, and low IER3 gene expression were the only markers showing in univariate analysis a poor prognostic value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment-free (TFS), progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, molecular parameters associated with a shorter TFS were: WT1 detection (p = 0.014), low TET2 (p = 0.002), and low IER3 expression (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WT1 detection (p = 0.006) and low TET2 (p = 0.006) expression were associated with a shorter PFS when multivariate analysis was carried out by including only molecular markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular values with an independent value in OS were: WT1 detection (p = 0.003), high EVI1 expression (p = 0.001), and undetectatable p15-CDKN2B (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WT1 expressers were associated with adverse clinical-biological features, high IPSS and WPSS scoring, and unfavorable molecular expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, detectable WT1 expression levels, and low TET2 and low IER3 expression in peripheral blood showed a strong association with adverse prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, WT1 was the only molecular marker displaying an independent prognostic value in both OS and TFS </plain></SENT>
