<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetics has special techniques of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present principles of these methods, their use in molecular cytogenetic examinations of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We quote our experience with mFISH for analyses of complex chromosomal rearrangements in neoplastic cells and identification of inborn supernumerary marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, we also review the first experiences with multicolor high resolution banding of chromosome (mBAND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method was used for analysis of bone marrow cells of patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and deletion of chromosome No. 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With mBAND exact breakpoints were localized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multicolor fluorescence methods mFISH and mBAND becones the new tools for more precise analyses of inborn and acquired numerical and structural chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
