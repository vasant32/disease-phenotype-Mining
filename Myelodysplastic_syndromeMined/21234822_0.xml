<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 57-year-old male smoker with a non-healing tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> who underwent tonsillectomy to rule out tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> after failed antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 2, he presented with a temperature of 40°C and white blood cell count of 34700/μL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic therapy was begun; however, he died 1 day later due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> and septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though extremely rare, tonsillar involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a non-healing tonsillar lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When definitive diagnosis requires a tissue sample, punch biopsy may be preferable to tonsillectomy in a patient who may be immunocompromised, and appropriate prophylactic antibiotics should be administered </plain></SENT>
