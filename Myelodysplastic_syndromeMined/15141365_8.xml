<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> is genotoxic in several in vitro and in vivo test systems, inducing micronuclei (MN), sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), and chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of polymorphic enzymes involved in the conjugation of reactive chemical intermediates to soluble forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These enzymes play a key role in the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds, and the polymorphic genes GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 have been associated with the differential metabolism of several genotoxicants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms on the frequency of MN and SCE induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> in human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were obtained from 15 healthy non-smoking donors, and their GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cultures of the lymphocytes with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> significantly increased the overall frequencies of MN and SCE (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the GSTM1 null genotype had a significantly higher frequency of MN compared with GSTM1-present individuals (P=0.013); in contrast, the GSTM1 genotype had no effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>-induced SCE frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other polymorphisms did not significantly affect the frequencies of MN or SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that GSTM1 is involved in the metabolic fate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and that polymorphisms in GSTM1 could be related to inter-individual differences in DNA damage arising from the exposure to this compound </plain></SENT>
