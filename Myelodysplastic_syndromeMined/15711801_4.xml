<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also studied the clinical features of patients showing high activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracellular collagenase activity, expressed as a ratio to the standardized fluorescence intensity, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (19.5+/-14.8 vs 13.3+/-6.8, p=0.024) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant influence of three variables of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was seen on activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 8 patients with activity of more than 26.9 (mean+2 standard deviations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls), 5 experienced an episode of delayed healing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, while 1 of 43 patients with activity of less than 26.9 experienced such an episode (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average collagenase activity of six patients with delayed healing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (44.7+/-28.9) was significantly higher than that of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (16.0+/-7.1, p=0.005) (Fig. 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also significantly higher than the activity of the control group (13.3+/-6.8, p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our report suggests that increased collagenase activity in neutrophils may delay healing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
