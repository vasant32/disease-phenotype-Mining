<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in erythropoiesis induced in vivo by recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), by means of some new, non invasive laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of soluble transferrin receptor (STR), a marker of total marrow erythroid activity, and automated detection of high fluorescence reticulocytes (HFR) and hypochromic erythrocytes (HE) (respectively, indexes of effective erythropoiesis and functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>) were longitudinally measured in 25 MDS patients treated with r-EPO, and then correlated with conventional clinical and laboratory features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stimulation of erythropoiesis was documented in 8 patients, whose serum STR levels showed a significant, early (within 16 days) increase during treatment with r-EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only 3 of these patients demonstrated a concomitant rise in HFR, and these were the only subjects who experienced a significant clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients also developed a functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> while on treatment, as documented by an increase in HE, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum iron, transferrin saturation and even very high levels of ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They needed iron supplementation to maintain the response to r-EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No variation in STR, HFR or HE occurred in the remaining 17 unresponsive patients during at least two months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase, as aspecific marker of cellular proliferative activity, paralleled those of STR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between STR, HFR or HE and serum levels of endogenous EPO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or transfusion requirements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and complex pattern of erythroid response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with r-EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results indicate that STR, HFR and HE may provide useful information for the clinical management of these patients </plain></SENT>
