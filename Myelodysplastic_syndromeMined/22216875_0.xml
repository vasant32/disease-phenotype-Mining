<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available about the incidence and etiology of infectious episodes during the total treatment period associated with a decreased immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2005 children diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, r-ALL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and post-HSCT patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review based on microbiological data was performed to describe the incidence and etiology of the infectious complications during the total treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty disease-specific patient episodes were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of 184 microbiologically proven infectious episodes were diagnosed in patients receiving chemotherapy, and 58% occurred in HSCT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, 123 (67%) infectious episodes were diagnosed; of the isolated species 83% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, 6% fungal, and 11% <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the period without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, 61 (33%) infectious episodes were diagnosed, with 38% <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, 3% fungal, and 59% <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> species isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the infectious episodes diagnosed in patients treated with an HSCT, 52% (n = 55) occurred in the post-engraftment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients treated with chemotherapy, 92% of the infectious episodes were diagnosed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of proven infectious episodes in post-HSCT patients was not influenced by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, while in patients receiving chemotherapy significantly lower numbers of proven infectious episodes were diagnosed outside the neutropenic period </plain></SENT>
