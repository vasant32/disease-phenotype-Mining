<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze whether or not leukemic clonogenic cells are restricted to the CD34+ cell fraction and to investigate the effect of IL-3 and G-CSF on blast cell populations dissected according to their CD34 reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose 34 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into three groups according to CD34 antigen expression: (1) cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blast cells (100%) were positive for the CD34 Ag (n = 9); (2) cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blast cells lacked the expression of this antigen (n = 10); and (3) patients in whom both, CD34 positive and negative blast cell subsets coexisted (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 cases immunomagnetic cell selection was performed and two subpopulations were separated: one, phenotypically more immature (CD34+), and another, theoretically more differentiated (CD34-/33+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in three cases both CD34+ and CD34- blast cell subpopulations were sorted using a FACStar flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blast colony assays were performed using 0.9% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> and two different recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs), IL-3 and G-CSF, were used as growth stimulants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Either, a single or a combination of the growth factors was added to cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colony formation was observed in both 100% positive or 100% negative cases for the CD34 antigen as well as in the CD34+ and CD34- cell fractions separated by immunomagnetic selection or flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of G-CSF and IL-3 on both cell fractions was as follows: cases with a uniform population according to CD34 expression (100% positive or negative) showed a better growth response with IL-3 especially for the CD34+ cases (87% vs 40% of CD34+ and CD34- cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the CD34-/33+ selected fractions, IL-3 tended to induce a higher proliferative response than G-CSF while the opposite was found within the CD34+ cell selected fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast it was observed that both IL-3 and G-CSF induced a higher PE on the CD34- blast cells (both selected and 100% negative), although the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The existence of a possible synergistic effect (SE) between HGFs was also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, a synergistic growth was observed in nine out of the 13 selected cases studied and this effect could be seen in both CD34- or CD34+ blast cell fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the complete phenotypic characteristics of these cells revealed that cell fractions showing SE were more immature according to the expression of CD15 and HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that in leukemic hematopoiesis, CD34 antigen expression does not have the same significance as it does in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis since clonogenic cells are not restricted to the CD34+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) blast cell fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our study shows that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response to HGFs observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients may be associated with the existence of immunophenotypically different blast cell subsets </plain></SENT>
