<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel long-term cultured interleukin (IL)-3-dependent human myelodysplastic cell line, MDS92, was shown to contain several myeloid-lineage cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and a small number of megakaryocyte-lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore this cell line possesses at least bipotential characteristics of myeloid- and megakaryocyte-lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor clearly promoted the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity of MDS92 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To the contrary, the incidence and growth of CD41-positive cells were hardly affected by the addition of IL-6, IL-11, c-mpl ligand (thrombopoietin, TPO) or erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TPO slightly supported the growth of CD34-positive cell fraction, but not CD41-positive cell fraction of MDS92 cells in combination with IL-3 or Steel factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This cell line will be a useful tool for the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stem cells, but the mechanism of commitment of differentiation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stem cells remains unknown </plain></SENT>
