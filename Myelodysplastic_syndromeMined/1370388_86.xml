<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other surface markers (CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD34) were studied by the same technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A marker was considered positive when 20% or more cells were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 150 samples, 71 were P-170-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases did not differ from P-170-negative cases with regard to age, sex, initial white blood cell (WBC) counts, or French-American-British (FAB) type (except for M3 ANLL, which were more frequently negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> arising from previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and therapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were more frequently P-170-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34 and P-170 expression were significantly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower in P-170-positive (23/71, 32%) than in P-170-negative cases (64/79, 81%) (P less than 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD34 positivity was also associated with a low remission rate (P less than 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was shorter for P-170- and CD34-positive patients (P less than 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of both markers was confirmed in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CR duration was also shorter for P-170-positive cases, but the difference is less significant (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that P-170 analysis may be an important tool for predicting the outcome of intensive chemotherapy in ANLL patients </plain></SENT>
