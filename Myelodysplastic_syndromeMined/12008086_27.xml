<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies on the functional integrity of the hematopoietic microenvironment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some of them suggest that such a microenvironment is functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, there is increasing evidence indicating that there are alterations in the function of microenvironment (adherent) cell layers from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adherent cell layers developed in vitro, however, consist of a mixture of different cell types-mostly fibroblasts and macrophages-thus, it is not clear which cell type(s) is(are) functionally abnormal in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to address this issue, in the present study, we first assessed some functional properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived adherent cell layers, as a whole, and then we analyzed those same functional properties after separating these cells into two different populations: a fibroblast-enriched cell layer and a macrophage-enriched cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When whole adherent layers from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed, no significant differences were observed, as compared to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts, in terms of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and total cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A major difference, however, was observed when analyzing the production of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, adherent layers from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients produced higher levels of these cytokines (2- and 22-fold, respectively), as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When fibroblast- and macrophage-enriched cell layers were analyzed, a higher apoptotic index was observed in those derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow (4% of TUNEL-positive cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblast layers versus 27% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived fibroblast layers; 7% of TUNEL-positive cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> macrophage layers versus 24% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> macrophage layers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macrophages from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow produced significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha (nine-fold) than their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived fibroblasts, on the other hand, produced higher levels of IL-6 (nine-fold), as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts showed a discrete production of TNF-alpha, we found a very high production of this cytokine in cultures of fibroblasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, in the present study we have demonstrated that, at least in vitro, both fibroblasts and macrophages from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow (BM) are functionally abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such abnormalities include an increased apoptotic index, as well as a high production of both IL-6 and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
