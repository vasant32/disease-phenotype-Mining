<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rare familial cases are reported in which five disease genes have been identified to date (RUNX1, CEBPA, TERC, TERT and GATA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the genetic categorization of 27 families with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these families were screened for RUNX1, CEBPA, TERC, TERT and GATA2 as well as TET2 and NPM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of the 27 families had telomerase mutations; one had a RUNX1 mutation, while none were found to have TET2, CEBPA or NPM1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified four families with heterozygous GATA2 mutations, each associated with a different phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While one of these mutations is novel, three have been previously reported: one has been described in dendritic cell, monocyte, B and NK lymphoid (DCML) deficiency and one is in a family that has been reported in a series with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001004'>lymphoedema</z:hpo> with a predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (Emberger syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, genetic characterization was shown in 10 (four GATA2, three TERT, two TERC, one RUNX1) of these families; however 17 remain uncharacterized, highlighting marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and the scope for further functional pathways that could give rise to this group of disorders </plain></SENT>
