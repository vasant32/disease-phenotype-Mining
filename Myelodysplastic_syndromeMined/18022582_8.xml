<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting the clinical outcomes of haploidentical transplantation remain under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 157 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who underwent transplantation with nonmanipulated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized marrow and peripheral blood cells (G-BMPBs) from haploidentical donors after receiving myeloablative chemotherapy (Ara-C + BuCy + antithymocyte globulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow up observations after transplantation were made from 48 days to 1191 days (median, 448 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that the cohort given higher doses of CD3(+) cells (&gt; or = 177 x 10(6) /kg) in allograft transplantation had a significantly lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) (relative risk [RR] = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.16-0.77; P = .0090), better <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>) (RR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.26-0.84; P = .0106), and better overall survival (OS) (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.78; P = .0058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inversely, advanced-stage disease was a strong predictor of greater posttransplantation relapse (RR = 3.48; 95% CI = 1.26- 9.60; P = .0159), worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> (RR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.33-4.95; P = .0050), and worse OS (RR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.39-5.53; P = .0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high number of CD3(+) cells (&gt; 177 x 10(6)/kg) given to patients resulted in statistically less TRM and more intensive graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect without producing more severe grades of GVHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulting in a significantly better overall clinical outcome from haploidentical transplantation </plain></SENT>
