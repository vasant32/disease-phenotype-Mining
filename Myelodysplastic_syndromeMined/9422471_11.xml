<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early results of administration of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) to patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and &gt; or = 10 involved axillary nodes have been encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a multicenter trial to determine whether HDCT could be safely administered to patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> involving 4-9 axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with stage II or III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 4-9 involved axillary lymph nodes received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based induction chemotherapy, followed by high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (5.625 g/m2), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (165 mg/m2), and BCNU (450 mg/m2) and PBPC mobilized by sargramostim (GM-CSF) or filgrastim (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After completion of HDCT, patients received radiation therapy to the chest wall or involved breast, plus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival and disease-free survival, time to engraftment, and charges associated with HDCT were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of BCNU were determined and plasma AUC(BCNU) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients were evaluable for survival and relapse-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients received HDCT with PBPC support and were evaluable for toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (29%) developed late pulmonary drug toxicity, which resolved with a 10-week course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one affected patient, who subsequently died of pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients relapsed a median of 426 days (range 86-1117 days) after the start of induction chemotherapy, seven of whom have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients are alive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>-free at a median of 947 days (range 661-1730 days) after the start of therapy, including one patient who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 809 days after the start of HDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 4-year survival and disease-free survival from the start of treatment are 84 and 71%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma AUC(BCNU) was 400 (range 82-1255) microgxmin/ml and was not statistically different from that measured in historical controls who received 600 mg/m2 of BCNU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combined hospital and physician charges for patients treated at the University of Colorado decreased from a mean of $125845 for the first four patients to $77126 for the final seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HDCT with autologous PBPC can be administered with acceptable safety to patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> involving 4-9 axillary lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An ongoing, prospective randomized trial is evaluating the efficacy of HDCT for this patient group </plain></SENT>
