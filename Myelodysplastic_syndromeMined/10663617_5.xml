<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the bone marrow of 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at the time of diagnosis and during the course of the disease by means of Southern blot analysis and/or cytogenetic studies to detect and evaluate clonal markers, their implications for the prognosis of the disease, and the response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients either were enrolled in an EORTC study and received low-dose Ara-C with (n=31) or without (n=21) growth factors, according to the study protocol, or were treated supportively (only one patient received regular chemotherapy for concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Full or at least partial remission was achieved by 34% of the treated patients (n=54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 57% (53 of 93) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients a clonal marker of either kind was detected by Southern blot analysis and/or cytogenetic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal aberrations were found in 45% (35 of 77) of the cases examined at diagnosis, with solitary del(5q) aberrations occurring in 10% of the cases and complex aberrations in 18%, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 being a frequent finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 49% (28 of 57) were characterized by one or more gene rearrangements (e.g., Ig-JH, TcR-beta, M-bcr, GM-CSF, G-CSF, or IL-3) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five of 21 cases (24%) studied in hematological remission of the disease chromosomal aberrations were still detectable, and in seven of 23 (30%) a gene rearrangement persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found six cases with multiple clones exhibiting different susceptibilities to treatment and thereby indicating the oligoclonal character of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation revealed that the prognosis of the respective patients was directly related to the particular clonal markers detected at diagnosis: Risk groups were subdivided according to the karyotypes, with a solitary del(5q) aberration meaning a favorable, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype an intermediate, solitary aberrations without del(5q) a poor, and complex karyotypes a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed that densitometry helps to increase the sensitivity of Southern blot analysis by quantifying the amount of altered DNA, which often increases shortly before or at progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a high level of concordance of both clonality examinations with the clinical course of the disease and the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend cytogenetic studies and Southern blot analysis to detect clonal markers at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, to detect oligoclonality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, or to quantify the amount of clonal DNA, which appears to be a sensitive tool for evaluating the prognosis and response to therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
