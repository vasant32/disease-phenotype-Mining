<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the poorly understood pathophysiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), we have determined the gene expression profiles of the CD34+ cells of 55 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using a comprehensive array platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These profiles showed many similarities to reported interferon-gamma-induced gene expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells; indeed the 2 most up-regulated genes, IFIT1 and IFITM1, are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the expression of ISGs may play a role in the hematologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, such as peripheral blood cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of IFIT1 is a potential diagnostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined whether distinct gene expression profiles were associated with specific FAB and cytogenetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) showed a particular gene expression profile characterized by up-regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-related genes and, in particular, of those of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthesis (eg, ALAS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cells from patients with the del(5q) had a distinct gene expression profile, characterized by down-regulation of genes assigned to 5q, and up-regulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> HIST1 gene cluster at chromosome 6p21 and of genes related to the actin cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides important and new insights into the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
