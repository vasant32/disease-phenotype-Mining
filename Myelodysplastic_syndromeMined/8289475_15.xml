<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 73 years, range 65-87 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients had de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and the remaining patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subsequent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> ((n = 11) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment related AML</z:e> (n = 2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ETI consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 80 mg/m2 and thioguanine 100 mg/m2 twice a day on days 1-5, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 15 mg/m2 on days 1-3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> given orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TAD consisted of oral thioguanine and i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, both in the dose of 100 mg/m2 twice a day on days 1-5, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> 60 mg/m2 on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maintenance treatment was daily oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> 70 mg/m2 and weekly oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> 12 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ETI group complete remission (CR) was achieved in six patients after the first cycle and in nine more patients after the second cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was 15/25 = 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for the TAD group were four and two remissions, CR rate 6/26 = 23% (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival was significantly longer in the ETI arm (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 9.9 months in the ETI group and 3.7 months in the TAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the side effects between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the totally oral ETI regimen resulted in a significantly higher remission rate and longer survival than the 5-day TAD regimen in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, with no more toxicity </plain></SENT>
