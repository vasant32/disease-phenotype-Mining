<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a group of haemopoietic stem cell disorders of unknown cause, occurring predominantly in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have a high mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from complications of cytopenias or transformation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No effective treatment is known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies have identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (IDA), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> drug that can be administered orally, as an agent with possible activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a phase I-II study we administered oral IDA to 14 predominantly elderly patients (age range 40-79, median 74) with advanced forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) (one case), refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) (7 cases) or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IDA was given at a dose of 30 mg/m2 once each 2 weeks for 8 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one complete remission (CR) and one partial response (PR), for an overall response rate of 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean survival from time of initiation of therapy was 10.0 months (+/- 8.0 months [SD]; median, 7.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 patients developed severe side-effects, including 3 with life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and there were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from cytopenias during the drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small uncontrolled trial, the overall response rate and extent of toxicity seem similar to those reported for other forms of experimental therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, such as low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the drug's potential in this difficult condition may be warranted </plain></SENT>
