<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the implications of P-gp expression in clinical drug resistance, the authors examined the expression of P-gp in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) at initial presentation and relapse, using immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, C219 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and four of 11 patients with ALL had P-gp-positive results at the initial presentation, and most P-gp-positive patients did not respond to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of seven patients at the relapsed stage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> had P-gp-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of P-gp and clinical refractoriness to chemotherapy were highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the expression of P-gp is closely related to clinical drug resistance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
