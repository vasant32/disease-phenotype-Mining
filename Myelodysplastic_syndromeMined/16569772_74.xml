<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that lenalidomide (LEN), a novel thalidomide (Thal) analog, enhances antigen-specific expansion of NKT cells in response to the NKT ligand alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) in both healthy donors and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NKT cells activated in the presence of LEN have greater ability to secrete interferon-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigen-dependent activation of NKT cells was greater in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX) plus LEN than with DEX alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy with LEN/Thal also led to an increase in NKT cells in vivo in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and del5q <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together these data demonstrate that LEN and its analogues enhance CD1d-mediated presentation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigens and support combining these agents with NKT targeted approaches for protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
