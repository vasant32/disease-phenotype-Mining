<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases an HLA-identical sibling is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the mother of a patient is pregnant, cord blood from a related donor, which can be used for stem cell transplantation, might be obtainable in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the patient, knowledge of the foetal HLA-type can be important since it might influence choice of treatment and timing of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the foetus is HLA compatible, as would be the situation in 25% of cases, the delivery has to be arranged in such a way that cord stem cells can be collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, in the other 75% of cases (spontaneous) delivery can take place in the home/local setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we report four cases in which amniocentesis was performed and HLA-typing influenced treatment of the patient and delivery of the sibling </plain></SENT>
