<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> is an interstitial deletion within chromosome 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene has been hypothesized to lie in 5q31, the smallest commonly deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRF-1, a gene whose product manifests anti-oncogenic activity, was mapped to 5q31.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IRF-1 lies between IL-5 and CDC25C and is centromeric to IL-3 and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these genes, only IRF-1 was consistently deleted at one or both alleles in 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with aberrations of 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inactivating rearrangements of one IRF-1 allele, accompanied by deletion of the second allele, were also identified in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, IRF-1 may be a critically deleted gene in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
