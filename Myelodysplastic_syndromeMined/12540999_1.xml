<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, LAT (linker for activation of T cells), a molecule involved in T-cell activation and platelet aggregation, was found to be expressed by megakaryocytes and platelets in tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared VWF and LAT immunoreactivity on megakaryocytes in 64 bone marrow biopsies from 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC), and from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=18), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMPD</z:e> (n=21) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006733'>acute megakaryocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M7, n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections with polyclonal antibodies against VWF and LAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity was evaluated by counting positive megakaryocytes in 10 high-power fields, and values were compared using Student's t test for paired data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both VWF and LAT predominantly stained the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes, although LAT was also recognizable on the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most biopsies, the immunoreactivity of the two antibodies was quite similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noticed between the mean values of VWF+ and LAT+ megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in 22 cases (5 NC; 5 MDS; 6 CMPD; 6 AML-M7), the number of LAT+ megakaryocytes was at least 30% higher than VWF+cells, while in 3 cases opposite findings were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 AML-M7 cases, anti-LAT antibodies stained numerous megakaryocytes, but anti-VWF staining was practically negative; in another 5 AML-M7 cases, anti-LAT labeling was much stronger than anti-VWF staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LAT represents a useful immunohistochemical marker for megakaryocytes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems to be expressed by megakaryocytes more than VWF in most cases and, particularly, in conditions associated with poorly differentiated megakaryocytes, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006733'>acute megakaryocytic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of LAT staining should be recommended in association with other megakaryocyte markers in the study of bone marrow biopsies in cases of hematopoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
