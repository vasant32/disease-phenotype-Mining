<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased levels in urine, serum, plasma, or malignant tissue have been associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure VEGF and bFGF levels in plasma samples from 99 patients with previously untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 41 patients; 42%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 58 patients; 58%) and compared the results with the results from a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased expression levels of VEGF and bFGF were found in the plasma from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the levels found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of VEGF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were similar (median, 30.63 pg/mL and 34.41 pg/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in bFGF levels between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (median, 6.38 pg/mL and 6.98 pg/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of VEGF were associated with reduced survival (P = 0.02) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as well as lower complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated VEGF levels were not associated with reduced remission duration (CRD) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between VEGF levels and survival, CRD, or CR rates in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between bFGF levels and CR rates or survival in patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma VEGF levels have prognostic significance in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lack of clinical relevance of VEGF levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suggests some biologic difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
