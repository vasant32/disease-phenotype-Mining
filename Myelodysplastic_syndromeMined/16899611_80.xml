<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase I study, LBH589 was administered i.v. as a 30-minute infusion on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifteen patients (median age, 63 years; range, 42-87 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (13 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (1 patient), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1 patient) were treated with LBH589 at the following dose levels (mg/m(2)): 4.8 (3 patients), 7.2 (3 patients), 9.0 (1 patient), 11.5 (3 patient), and 14.0 (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation were measured using quantitative flow cytometry and plasma LBH589 concentrations were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 QTcF prolongation) were observed, four at 14.0 mg/m(2) and one at 11.5 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QTcF prolongation was asymptomatic and reversed on LBH589 discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other potentially LBH589-related toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (33%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (33%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> (27%), loss of appetite (13%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 11 patients with peripheral blasts, transient reductions occurred with a rebound following the 7-day treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>H3 acetylation increase was significant in B-cells (CD19(+); P = 0.02) and blasts (CD34(+); P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in H2B acetylation was highest in CD19(+) and CD34(+) cells [3.8-fold (P = 0.01) and 4.4-fold (P = 0.03), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median acetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> H2B and H3 in CD34(+) and CD19(+) cells significantly increased on therapy as did <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD14(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Area under the curve increased proportionally with dose with a terminal half-life of approximately 11 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of LBH589 was well tolerated at doses &lt;11.5 mg/m(2) with consistent transient antileukemic and biological effects </plain></SENT>
