<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper illustrates the utility of FISH by describing a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who was initially studied using GTG-banding and whose bone marrow was found to be populated with hyperdiploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH was used to delineate the numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It revealed the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and determined that the previously unidentifiable marker chromosome was of chromosome 10 origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 is a frequent finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the structural chromosomal abnormality of chromosome 10 as reported here is not a common finding </plain></SENT>
