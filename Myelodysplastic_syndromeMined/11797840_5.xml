<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the alpha-radiation risks in patients who received injections of Thorotrast, an X-ray contrast medium used in Europe, Japan, and the United States from 1930 to 1955 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thorotrast was composed of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37339">thorium dioxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37339">ThO2</z:chebi>) and Th-232, a naturally occurring radionuclide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the physical half-life of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37339">ThO2</z:chebi> is 14 billion years and Thorotrast is hardly eliminated from the body, tissues in which it was deposited are irradiated by alpha-radiation for the entire lifetime of the subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dosimetry of Thorotrast patients is very complicated, but currently its reliability is quite high compared with other irradiated populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major causes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of Thorotrast patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo>, liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three histologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> are found: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003667'>angiosarcoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> is the most frequent, <z:mp ids='MP_0003667'>angiosarcoma</z:mp> is characteristic of alpha-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with a higher incidence of increase than the general population, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thorotrast patients exhaled a high concentration of <z:chebi fb="72" ids="33314">radon</z:chebi> (Rn-220), a progeny of Th-232, but no excesses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in the patients of Japan, Germany, and Denmark were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses of p53 genes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies at 17p locus were performed to characterize the genetic changes in Thorotrast-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, LOH, supposedly corresponding to large deletions was not frequent; most mutations were transitions, also seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the general population, suggesting that genetic changes of Thorotrast-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are mainly delayed mutations, and not the result of the direct effects of radiation </plain></SENT>
