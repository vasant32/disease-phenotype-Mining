<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the EGF receptor has been found to reside at 7p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a probe specific for erb B oncogene, which encodes a truncated form of the EGF receptor, we examined <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA derived from bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bearing an abnormal clone in their bone marrow with a similar unbalanced 1;7 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA-excess slot blot hybridization to 5'-32p-labeled cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> revealed from ten- to thirtyfold enhancement in accumulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> specific for erb B in both peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, enhancement of H-ras <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation was detected in some, though expression of other genes such as actin, N-ras, myc, src, B-lym, and 20 other genes was not found to be enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased erb B expression was not apparent in mononuclear cells from patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of restriction-enzyme-cleaved DNA from three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with an unbalanced 1;7 translocation revealed that erb B gene was amplified at least twentyfold in peripheral blood white blood cells, while levels of actin hybridization were comparable to those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No such amplification was evident in the ALL patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that +der(1),t(1;7)(p11;p11) chromosomal anomalies can be specifically associated with amplification of erb B DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences </plain></SENT>
