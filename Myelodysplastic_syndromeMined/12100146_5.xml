<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is often difficult to distinguish hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) from acquired aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA), because of the considerable clinical, cytological and histological similarities between these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distinction between AA and h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is important because there is a higher risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in patients with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the development of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the potential importance of TNF-alpha in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> (BM) disorders, we examined whether analysis ofTNF-receptor expression could be used as a tool to differentiate AA from h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis revealed that BM stem cells (CD34+) from AA patients have markedly greater TNF receptor (R) 1 and TNFR2 expression than those from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the BM stem cells with a high expression of TNFR in patients with AA may be potently sensitive to TNF-alpha stimulation of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose that quantification of TNFR expression in BM stem cellsmay be a useful method to distinguish AA from h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
