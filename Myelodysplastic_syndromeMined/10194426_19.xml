<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus was detected in 12% of Japanese blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence and clinical influence of TTV in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from 25 BMT recipients obtained 6 to 12 weeks after the transplant were examined for TTV-DNA by the seminested polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial samples were additionally analyzed in patients with TTV-DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 25 recipients (60%) were positive for TTV-DNA after transplant, whereas it was detected in only two of 20 BMT donors (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients positive for TTV-DNA before BMT, the amount of TTV-DNA decreased to an undetectable level during the myelosuppressed period after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that there was a novel group of TTV, G3, classified by the nucleotide sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 135.0 IU/L and 116.5 IU/L (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, 4 to 36 IU/L) in TTV-positive and TTV-negative recipients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one of the seven TTV-positive patients who developed hepatic injury (ALT &gt; 150 IU/L), a serial change in the serum TTV titer showed a good correlation with the ALT level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that (1) the prevalence of TTV is high in BMT recipients, (2) TTV might be replicated mainly in hematopoietic cells, (3) transfusion-transmitted TTV may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e>, (4) a novel genetic group of TTV, G3, was discovered, and (5) TTV does not seem to frequently cause hepatic injury, although one patient was strongly suggested to have TTV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
