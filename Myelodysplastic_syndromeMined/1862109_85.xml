<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amplifying a polymorphic portion of the X chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene after selective digestion of the active X chromosome with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme gave results fully concordant with standard Southern blotting of DNA samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (polyclonal) polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) as well as clonal PMN from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (PCV) </plain></SENT>
