<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We report on three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> that developed during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, a subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent fundus, visual field examination, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A thrombophilic tendency investigation including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, protein C, free protein S, and antithrombin III, polymerase chain reaction and hybridisation to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and a bone marrow biopsy were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative recovery of visual function was noted in two patients, a 58-year-old man and a 67-year-old woman, whereas the vision of the third patient, a 62-year-old man, showed only marginal improvement during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients received vigorous blood transfusion during hospitalization, while dosage adjustment of the erythropoietin infusion was decided for the third one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic tendency was not identified in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, as presented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> subtype, probably in the presence of additional factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, is likely to be complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, possibly through a mechanism of anemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and/or microvascular insufficiency </plain></SENT>
