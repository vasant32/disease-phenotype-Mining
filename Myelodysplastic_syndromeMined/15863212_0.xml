<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MOLM-17/-18 are proliferatively responsive to the growth factors present in the culture supernatant of the 5637 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B-LCLs are constitutively growth factor-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MOLM-17 and B422 were established at eight months after the initial diagnosis, while MOLM-18 and B423 were derived from a sample one month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> sample revealed a mixed lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> immunophenotype with positivity for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD13 and CD19; the second sample revealed solely myeloid characteristics with positivity for CD13, CD41 and CD61, whereas TdT was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MOLM-17/-18 showed immunomarker profiles typical of the myelomonocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The karyotype analysis of MOLM-17/-18 revealed various non-random numerical and structural abnormalities including del(5)(q?), -7, der(11)add(11)(p11.2)add(11)(q23), add(17)(p11.2), add(18)(p11.2), -20, -22 as common aberrations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall profile of MOLM-17/-18 based on their extensive immunological, cytogenetic and functional characterization suggests that these cell lines together with the paired B-LCLs B422 and B423 may represent scientifically significant in vitro models which could facilitate investigations into the pathobiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
