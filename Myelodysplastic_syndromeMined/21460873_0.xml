<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indications for PBSCT were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=63/8), ALL (n=17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n=10) and myeloproliferative syndrome (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reasons for DLI were hematological relapse (n=81), molecular and/or cytogenetic relapse (n=5), mixed chimerism (n=22) and prophylactic DLI in high-risk patients (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DLIs were well tolerated with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DLI-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-type GvHD (aGvHD) was observed in 19 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-type GvHD (cGvHD) developed in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients died of GvHD complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DLI induced CR, complete chimerism or PR in 34 patients; 24 patients had stable disease, 50 patients progressed and 13 patients were not evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Objective response was more obvious for molecular relapse (5/5) or mixed chimerism (14/22) compared with hematological relapse (13/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival after first DLI was 10.4 months (95% confidence interval: 4.4-26.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved G-CSF-stimulated DLI, derived from allogeneic grafts are safe and immunoreactive, and can be applied early in case of mixed chimerism and molecular or cytogenetic relapse </plain></SENT>
