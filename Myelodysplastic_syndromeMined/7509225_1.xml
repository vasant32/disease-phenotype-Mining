<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, marrows from 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were assayed for myeloid progenitor cells in agar gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colony stimulating activity was provided by the recombinant human colony stimulating factors granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), fusion protein (FP), c-kit ligand (KL) or GM-CSF combined with other cytokines (KL, IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased colony forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) were detected in most cases (69%) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither FP nor the combination of GM-CSF + IL-3 produced more colonies than GM-CSF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of CFU-GM did not correlate with French American British (FAB) class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> marrows (7) from patients with 5q- showed augmentation of GM-CSF induced colonies with the addition of KL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, KL augmentation was noted in only 42% of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This in vitro result suggests that 5q- may predict a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a likelihood to respond to the combination of GM-CSF + KL </plain></SENT>
