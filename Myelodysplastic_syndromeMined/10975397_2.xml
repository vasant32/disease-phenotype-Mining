<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the differentiation-inducing effect on freshly isolated myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in liquid suspension culture by combined treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C; 5-10 ng/ml) in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Culture with G-CSF alone showed leukemic cell growth stimulation in 15 out of the 25 cases (60%) and induction of cell differentiation in 19 out of the 25 cases (76%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 23 cases (92%), either growth stimulation and/or differentiation induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells was observed in response to G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that most myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells are able to respond to G-CSF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment of cells with low-dose Ara-C alone resulted in the enhancement of myeloid specific antigens expression in 16 cases (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells with higher concentrations of Ara-C (over 50 ng/ml) alone resulted in cytocidal effects but not in the induction of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 15 cases (60%) showed pronounced myeloid differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells after combined exposure to G-CSF plus low-dose Ara-C as compared with cells treated with either G-CSF or Ara-C alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enhanced effect of differentiation induction by combining G-CSF plus low-dose Ara-C was also observed in a murine myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line WEHI-3B in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that treatment with G-CSF plus low-dose Ara-C is capable of inducing differentiation of leukemic cells in vitro, and also appears to be useful for the differentiation-based therapy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
