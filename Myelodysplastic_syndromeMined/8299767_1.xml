<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a chemiluminescence assay the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils from patients was increased in whole blood and decreased in purified cells, which suggests that neutrophils with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 tolerate poorly the cell purification procedures used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vitro migration of purified neutrophils obtained from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is known that patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 have an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible that neutrophils with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 are too easily triggered to a full-scale respiratory burst and thereby the cells exhaust their ability to eliminate invading microbes efficiently </plain></SENT>
