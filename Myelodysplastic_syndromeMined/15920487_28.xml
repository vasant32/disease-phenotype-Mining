<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined bone marrow karyotype at diagnosis in four female <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> patients, aged between 52 and 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, we observed chromosome rearrangement involving the same 4q24 band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a balanced reciprocal translocation as the sole abnormality - t(3;4)(q26;q24), t(4;5)(q24;p16) and t(4;7)(q24;q21) - and the fourth had del(4)(q23q24), +4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a set of 4q BAC probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in these four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a 4q24 submicroscopic deletion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three translocations, with a common deletion of approximately 0.5 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three cases, we concluded that rearrangement occurred in an early hematopoietic stem cell, as it was detected, in mosaic with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, in a fraction of remission bone marrow cells, peripheral T and B lymphocytes, malignant lymph node T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in one case and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines established in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, one of 10 additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients tested by FISH had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and deletion of one of the commonly deleted probe sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene may therefore be involved, especially as two patients developed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the same time as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513644" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myeloid proliferation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
