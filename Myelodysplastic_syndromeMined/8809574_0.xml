<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The loss of functional IRF-1 has been shown in approximately 30% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report an alternative mechanism of inactivation of IRF-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified an IRF-1 binding protein (IRF-BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein sequencing revealed that IRF-BP was identical to nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar phosphoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis showed that IRF-BP inhibited DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of IRF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover when we examined several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples, the level of IRF-BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that IRF-BP binds to IRF-1, and that overexpression of IRF-BP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> leads to escape from IRF-1-regulated growth control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was also supported by the fact that overexpression of IRF-BP in NIH 3T3 cells rendered cells transformed </plain></SENT>
