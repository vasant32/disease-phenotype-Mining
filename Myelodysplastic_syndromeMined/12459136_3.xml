<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze comparability between the ninth and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) applied to coding causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the ninth and tenth revisions of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, 80,084 statistical bulletins of mortality registered in 1999 were assigned the Basic Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistical bulletins corresponded to the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Cantabria, Murcia, Navarre and the Basque Country, and the city of Barcelona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were classified into 17 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simple correspondence, the Kappa index and the comparability ratio for major causes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> changed group due to an increase (36.4%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041849" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious and parasitic diseases</z:e>, mainly because of the inclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, and a corresponding decrease due to the exclusion of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, nutritional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was moved to the category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group including <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases, eye</z:e> and related diseases, and ear and mastoid apophysis diseases increased (14.7%) at the expense of mental and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior disorders</z:e>, due to the inclusion of senile and presenile organic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poorly-defined entities increased (14.1%) due to the inclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and its synonyms, together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, to the detriment of diseases of the vascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diseases of the respiratory system</z:e> increased (4.8%) due to the inclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, previously considered as a poorly defined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correspondence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes was 96.4% and kappa's index was 94.9% CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 affects the comparability of statistical series of mortality according to cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study allow us to identify the main modifications and to quantify the changes in the major causes of mortality in Spain </plain></SENT>
