<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 MDS patients had clonally expanded CD8(+) T-cell populations that recognized aneuploid hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, microarray analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> 1 (WT1) gene was overexpressed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 hematopoietic progenitor (CD34(+)) cells compared with CD34(+) cells from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that WT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is up-regulated in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 relative to healthy controls and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 MDS; WT1 protein levels were also significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, using a combination of physical and functional assays to detect the presence and reactivity of specific T cells, respectively, we demonstrate that IST-responsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exhibit significant CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses directed against WT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells were present within expanded T-cell receptor VÎ² subfamilies and inhibited hematopoiesis when added to autologous patient bone marrow cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that WT1 is one of the antigens that triggers T cell-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
