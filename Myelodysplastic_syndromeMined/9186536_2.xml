<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive response, defined as an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> more than 2 g/dl and independence of blood transfusions was observed in 23 of 48 evaluable patients (48%) within a median of 8 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In detail, rhEPO corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 11 of 14 patients (79%) with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 8 of 15 patients (53%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and in 4 of 10 patients (40%) with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median dose of rhEPO in successful cases was 5000 U daily </plain></SENT>
