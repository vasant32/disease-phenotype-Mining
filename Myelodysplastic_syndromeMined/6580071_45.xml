<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase I clinical trial of 13-cRA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), using a single daily oral dose schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and one each with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> were treated with 13-cRA at doses ranging from 20 to 125 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was seen only at the highest dose level of 125 mg/m2/day and was completely reversible upon cessation of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other toxic effects were mild, and included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cheilosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000962'>hyperkeratosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, and elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were evaluable for therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed improvement in hematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These responses included normalization of bone marrow blast count and increases in leukocyte count, platelet count, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses were generally not seen until at least 3 weeks of therapy were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that further study of 13-cRA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is warranted and recommend that future studies utilize a starting dose of 100 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
