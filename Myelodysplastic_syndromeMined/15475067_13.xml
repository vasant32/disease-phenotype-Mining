<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> involves differentiation of abnormal granulocyte precursors, or emergence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous study in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, analyzing a differentiating activity of GM-CSF, had shown heterogenous granulocyte responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to determine the ratio of clonal and nonclonal peripheral blood granulocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with DAC using FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients with initial severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, an informative cytogenetic marker, complete normalization of peripheral blood neutrophils and a bone marrow cytogenetic response following DAC, &gt;90% of the cells contributing to neutrophil normalization lacked this clonal marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of them, an early and transient increase in clonal neutrophils was compatible also with a modest differentiating effect upon the dysplastic granulocyte precursors, whereas in a third patient, resistant to re-treatment with DAC, no expansion of either granulocyte population occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the responders, leukocyte nadirs following DAC appeared less pronounced after conversion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, restoration of nonclonal hematopoiesis may be the predominant effect of DAC both in early and late stages of treatment, at least in patients achieving a hematologic and cytogenetic response </plain></SENT>
