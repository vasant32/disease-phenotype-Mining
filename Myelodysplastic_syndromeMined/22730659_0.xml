<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of SHP-1 promoter methylation on the pathogenesis and progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and its related mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 63 MDS patients were divided into low-grade (LG) group and high-grade (HG) group according to IPSS score system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation specific-PCR (MSP) were used to detect the status of SHP-1 promoter methylation in bone marrow (BM) samples from different risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line, SKK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot was used to detect signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT3) activation in SKK-1 cell line and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No SHP-1 promoter methylation could be detected in healthy controls BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partially methylation was found in SKK-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation rate of SHP-1 gene promoter was found in BM of 24.2% of low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 63.3% of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the difference between these two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05); Patients were divided into different groups according to WHO subtype, chromosomal karyotype and blast cells in bone marrow, methylation rates of SHP-1 were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e>, poor karyotype group and samples with 0.11-0.19 blast cells (P &lt; 0.05); The phosphorylation protein of STAT3 was detected in SKK-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of phosphorylation STAT3 was significantly higher in HG group than in LG group (66.7% vs 18.2%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between SHP-1 promoter methylation and STAT3 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal methylation of SHP-1 gene promoter might have tentative role in the pathogenesis and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which may be involved in STAT3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of SHP-1 promoter methylation may be helpful to evaluate the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
