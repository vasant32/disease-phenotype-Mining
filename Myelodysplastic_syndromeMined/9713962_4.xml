<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fas /<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1(CD95) is a cell surface protein inducing an apoptotic signal after its binding to Fas ligand or to a functional anti-Fas antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied Fas expression by immunocytochemistry on marrow slides from 30 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased Fas expression in erythroblasts and/or immature granulocytes, compared to controls, was seen in 12 (40%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in 16 of the 18 cases with &gt; or = 5% marrow blasts, a variable proportion of blasts expressed Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> was found by morphological analysis and/or TUNEL technique in marrow cells from 8 of the 26 cases analyzed (31%) The ability of Fas antigen to trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was studied after addition of a functional anti Fas antibody in 5 of the patients with Fas overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of this antibody, however, only lead to mild increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in immature granulocytes (but not other myeloid cells) in 2 of the 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased Fas expression is seen in myeloid and/or blast cells in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between this finding and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> still remains to be established </plain></SENT>
