<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 32 female patients heterozygous for M27 beta only seven (22%) demonstrate monoclonality of peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>12 (37%) give unequivocal polyclonal results and the remaining cases give patterns of X-inactivation which cannot be interpreted either way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A study of 68 MDS patients showed five (7%) with a population of B-cells with a monoclonal rearrangement of CDR3 compared with none out of 60 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, none out of 15 with B-non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) in remission and 19 out of 25 (75%) of cases of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal lymphocytes were found by both techniques in only two females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the presence of polyclonal lymphocytes is a common finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
