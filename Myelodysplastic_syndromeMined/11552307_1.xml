<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) many scoring systems were developed to improve the prognostic stratification of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND AIM OF THE STUDY: We enrolled 54 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, having an advanced median age of 78.5 years, that discouraged the choice of aggressive treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we employed only the Bournemouth score (without cytogenetic analysis), with the aim to identify the best predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both for overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free analysis, shorter survival and faster development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with severe peripheral cytopenia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, major proportion of bone marrow blasts (over 20%) and with the higher Bournemouth score (i.e. 3-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis by the Cox's regression model showed that a high percentage of bone marrow blasts presented the best statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our survey we confirmed the value of Bournemouth score in identifying those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients presenting a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a high percentage of bone marrow blasts rose as the best predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and leukemic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kariotypic analysis, with a stronger prognostic power but also complex and expensive, was not performed in our elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, who were unable to tolerate aggressive treatments </plain></SENT>
