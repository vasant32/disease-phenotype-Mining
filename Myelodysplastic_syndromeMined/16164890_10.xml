<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify initial laboratory findings useful for the later diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 62 consecutive adult patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and whose peripheral blood film was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent physical examination and routine laboratory tests and was prospectively followed for 22.5 +/- 9.8 months (range, 8 to 41 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, the presence of platelet-associated and plasma anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, the percentage of reticulated platelets, and the plasma thrombopoietin level were examined at the first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was based on the clinical history, physical examination, complete blood test, bone marrow findings, and the clinical course at last observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six patients were diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and 16 as having another disorder, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and reduced platelet production, with or without other cytopenias, and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or evidence for destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six initial laboratory findings discriminated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> from other diagnoses: the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp>, increased frequency of anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, increased platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, elevated percentage of reticulated platelets, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly increased plasma thrombopoietin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three or more of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>-associated findings were found at presentation in 44 patients (96%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> later diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, compared with only 1 patient (6%) whose disorder was non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial laboratory findings can well predict future diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies prospectively evaluating these same diagnostic criteria on another, independent set of patients are necessary </plain></SENT>
