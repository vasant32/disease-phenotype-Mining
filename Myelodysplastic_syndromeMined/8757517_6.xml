<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PRAT analysis was positive in 21/30 patients (70%), but antiplatelet antibodies were found in only eight by the MAIPA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet lifespan was shortened in five cases, only one of whom had a positive MAIPA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> (600 mg/d), and 9/26 evaluable patients (35%) responded, including three of the five patients with shortened platelet lifespan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation between platelet lifespan, results of PRAT and MAIPA tests, and response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, specific antiplatelet autoantibodies, reduced platelet lifespan, and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy on platelets were seen in 20%, 17% and 35% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, respectively, but no correlation between these findings was found in this study </plain></SENT>
