<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CD34 (+) cells were separated by magnetic bead-activated cell sorter (MACS) system, and cultured in fluid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> semisolid medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> colorimetry was used to examine the inhibitory effect of IL-15 on the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells.The numbers of CD34(+)cells and colony formation of CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-G, CFU-GEMM were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD33, CD13, CD71, CD19 and CD3 on cultured cells and the change of cell-cycle were analyzed by FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recovery rate of CD34(+) cells was (75.4+/-5.2) %, the purity of CD34 (+) cells in positive fraction was (90.3+/-6.3) % and the enriched rate was (83.1+/-12.5) % in 11 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> colorimetry detection showed that IL-15 could promote the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal time of promotoing CD34(+) cell proliferation by IL-15 was 8 days and optimal dosage of IL-15 was 20 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After culture for 8 days with 0 microg/L IL-15 (control group) and 20 microg/L IL-15(experimental group), the number of CD34 (+) cells increased by 4.6-fold in control group and 6.3-fold in experimental group (P&lt;0.05, n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The colony formation rates of experimental group were significantly higher than those of control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression rates of the CD molecules (except for CD3) on CD34(+) in experimental group were notably higher than those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As compared with control group, much more CD34(+) cells of experimental group were in G(2) and S phase of cell cycle(P&lt;0.05, n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-15 can obviously promote the proliferation and differentiation of CD34(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
