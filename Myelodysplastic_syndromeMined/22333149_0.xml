<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 59 patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were divided into low-grade (n = 33) and high-grade (n = 26) groups according to international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SDF-1 and VEGF levels in BM plasma, CXCR4 expression on BM CD34(+) cell and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SDF-1 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls [(689 ± 190) ng/L, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And the low-grade group was significantly higher than that of high-grade group [(2301 ± 413) vs (1173 ± 501) ng/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 expression on CD34(+) cells were significantly higher in high-grade group (68.1% ± 18.8%) than that of both low-grade (21.0% ± 9.7%) and control groups (19.4% ± 5.3%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic rate of CD34(+) cells were 54.8% ± 10.2% in low-grade group, 24.3% ± 7.9% in high-grade group and 18.5% ± 8.7% in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It significantly increased in low-grade group versus other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF levels were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in low-grade group [(286 ± 97) ng/L] and high-grade group [(407 ± 168) ng/L] versus control group [(157 ± 46) ng/L, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells and SDF-1 levels in low-grade group (r = 0.805, P &lt; 0.05), VEGF levels and CXCR4 expression rate in high-grade group (r = 0.683, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of SDF-1/CXCR4 is significantly abnormal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>And it is correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intervention of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may provide a new therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
