<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients show erosive telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)(n), without up-regulation of telomerase activity, suggesting that telomere shortening may be linked to cellular senescence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured telomere length in samples from 13 MDS patients and 8 healthy volunteers, based on telomere signals of individual chromosomes, using digital images of metaphases after quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> probes and compared the results with results obtained with the standard method of determining terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, we found a significant correlation between TRF length and telomere fluorescence signals detected by Q-FISH, and a relatively wide distribution of fluorescence telomere signals was demonstrated in every sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found no linear correlation between TRF length and telomere fluorescence signals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed weak telomere fluorescence signals, corresponding to short telomeres, with a narrow range compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TRF length represented telomere DNA in whole marrow cells, whereas telomere fluorescence signals by Q-FISH represented only marrow metaphases corresponding to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metaphases from most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed homogeneous telomere shortening, irrespective of the presence of cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, marrow metaphases from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals showed a relatively wide range of telomere signals in each metaphase, indicating that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, telomere shortening mechanisms that normally exist might be dysregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, analysis of telomere distribution as well as average telomere length detected by Q-FISH might be useful to clarify the telomere dynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
