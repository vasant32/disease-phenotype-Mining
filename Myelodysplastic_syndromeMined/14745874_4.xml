<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to determine whether intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ITRA) reduced the incidence of probable/proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> in this group of patients, and compare the results with those of a historic control group treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> capsules (F+I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who underwent induction chemotherapy received 200 mg of i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> over 60 minutes every 12 hours during the first 2 days followed by 200 mg given i.v. once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled, 96 of whom were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 48% of the patients in the group of patients treated with i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ITRA as well as in the F+I group completed prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (9%) in the study group developed either proven/probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (Candida glabrata in 5 patients, C. tropicalis in 1 patient, C krusei in 1 patient, and Fusarium in 2 patients) compared with 3 patients (4%) with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> in the historic control group (C. tropicalis in 1 patient and Aspergillus in 2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences noted between the two groups with regard to the percentage of patients who developed proven/probable or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> as well as with regard to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results also were obtained after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ITRA was NCI Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite its theoretic advantages, the authors found no evidence that i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ITRA is superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> capsules, at least when the latter is combined with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
