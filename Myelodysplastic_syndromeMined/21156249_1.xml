<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic techniques showed a karyotype with two different deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 distributed in three clones: 46,XY,del(1)(p34),del(5)(q14q23)[2]/46,XY,del(1)(p34),del(5)(q14q34)[10]/46,idem,inv(5)(q?11q?34)[7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Precise characterization of the breakpoints, delineation of the deleted regions, identification of the complex intrachromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 5, and sequential accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities were elucidated by several fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the clinical, biological, and cytogenetic evolution under lenalidomide treatment and after its interruption </plain></SENT>
