<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With these techniques, we studied a 61-year-old woman with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GdB/GdA heterozygosity was demonstrated in skin and cultured T lymphocytes, which exhibited both A and B type G6PD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, erythrocytes, platelets, granulocytes, and marrow nucleated cells displayed almost exclusively G6PD type B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 21 of 24 Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid lines that expressed a single immunoglobulin light chain showed only type B G6PD, suggesting that the stem cells involved by this disease were clonal and could differentiate to B lymphocytes as well as to mature granulocytes, erythrocytes , and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultured skin fibroblasts and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes were karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but two independent abnormalities were found in marrow--47,XX, +8 and 46,XX,del(11)(q23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of 14 type B G6PD lymphoblastoid lines analyzed in detail contained these karyotypic abnormalities, which strongly suggests that a visible chromosomal alteration is not the sole step in the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that at least two events are involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>: one causing proliferation of a clone of genetically unstable pluripotent stem cells and another inducing chromosomal abnormalities in its descendants </plain></SENT>
