<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unobstructed GATA-1 expression in early progenitor cells commits them to the myeloid lineage, channeling its differentiation towards erythrocytes and megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell frequently presenting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in erythroid and/or megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that measurement of GATA-1 expression levels in hematopoietic progenitor CD34(+) and the committed erythroid CD71(+) cells, from various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subcategories, could demonstrate GATA-1 involvement in the pathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients displayed significantly elevated GATA-1 mRNA expression, in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), progenitor CD34(+) and erythroid CD71(+) cells in contrast to the control population (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, GATA-1 mRNA expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD71(+) cells was positively correlated with their apoptotic levels (rho = 0.58, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GATA-1 expression levels were found to correlate with the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in high/INT-2 IPSS risk group expressed significantly higher GATA-1 mRNA levels, in both CD34(+) and CD71(+) cells, as opposed to low/INT-1 patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the former displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in the CD71(+) cells and significantly reduced neutrophil and platelet numbers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels compared with the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients display an increase of GATA-1 mRNA expression in BM cells, with high/INT-2 patients showing significantly higher levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher level of GATA-1 mRNA in erythroid cells was positively correlated with their degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the up-regulation of GATA-1 may be responsible for the peripheral cytopenias in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
