<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that cytogenetic analysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) provides information useful in determining their prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the chromosomal results obtained from 401 MDS patients by a multicentric study in Japan, we studied correlations between chromosomal findings and prognosis or leukemic transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with complex aberrations (cytogenetic abnormalities at more than three chromosomes), of any subtype, had a poor prognosis; for example, &gt; 60% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) showing complex aberrations died within one year, but only 11% of them developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), &gt; 70% of those with complex aberrations evolved into the leukemic phase and survived for less than one year, suggesting a biologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, about 5% of patients with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> exhibiting chromosomal findings other than -7/7q-, +8, two aberrations, and complex aberrations, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and had a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the presence of chromosome abnormalities alone in patients with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> is not a factor in predicting leukemic transformation or poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), the presence of chromosome aberrations at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis affected the occurrence of leukemic transformation (24% versus 43%), however, no particular difference was noted in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation with regard to whether they had chromosome changes or not, and about 60% of them evolved into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis related to complex aberrations was consistently noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes or age-matched groups, indicating that this cytogenetic anomaly is an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis and development of the leukemic phase and that between the latter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were significantly shorter in patients with complex aberrations than those without this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical significance of certain chromosomal abnormalities differs among subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a new scoring system for predicting prognosis by cytogenetic changes, in combination with hematologic parameters, was proposed </plain></SENT>
