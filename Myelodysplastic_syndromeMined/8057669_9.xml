<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a longitudinal analysis of the karyotypes and N-ras gene configuration of bone marrow cells in 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic evolution was found in eight patients, and was associated with disease progression, including leukemic transformation, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified N-ras mutations in six patients, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, in which oligonucleotide primers were constructed with induced mismatches, followed by endonuclease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing confirmed single base substitutions at codon 12 in two patients and at codon 13 in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of N-ras gene mutations was significantly higher in the karyotypically evolved group (five of eight patients) than in the stable group (one of 27 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of five patients harboring both karyotypic evolution and an N-ras mutation showed concomitant disease progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of four patients with either karyotypic evolution or N-ras mutation and six of 26 patients without any of these alterations also progressed to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the accumulation of these genetic alterations is closely associated with leukemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, although other genetic alterations may also play a key role in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
