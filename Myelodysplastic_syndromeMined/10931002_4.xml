<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the outcome of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) who were treated at the Fred Hutchinson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Center between 1990 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 11 male and 10 female patients with a median age of 47.4 years (range 1.0-62.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were conditioned either with total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy, with or without antithymocyte globulin (n = 19), or with chemotherapy alone (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The marrow donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 12 patients, an HLA-non-identical related donor in three patients and an unrelated volunteer donor in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluable patients achieved sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients developed grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (43.0%) are surviving disease free at 0.7-8.1 years (median 6.9) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients relapsed 75-660 d after transplant and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients died with organ failure and two died with GVHD and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival and relapse at 3 years were 39% and 25% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival was improved in patients with shorter disease duration compared with those with a long interval from diagnosis to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, as with other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, BMT offers curative therapy for a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> who have a suitable donor should be considered for transplantation, probably early in their disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it will be important to develop new regimens with enhanced antileukaemic efficacy without further increasing regimen-related toxicity and mortality </plain></SENT>
