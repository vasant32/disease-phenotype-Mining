<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a common remission-induction and consolidation course, patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor were scheduled for allogeneic transplantation and patients lacking a donor for autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 159 patients alive at 8 weeks from the start of treatment were included in the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 52 patients had a donor, 65 patients did not have a donor and in 42 patients the availability of a donor was not assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 52 patients, 36 (69%) with a donor underwent allogeneic transplantation (28 in CR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 65 patients, 33 (49%) received an autograft (27 in CR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rates at 4 years were 33.3% (s.e. = 6.7%) for patients with a donor and 39.0% (s.e. = 6.5%) for patients without a donor (P = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival rates were 23.1% (s.e. = 6.2%) and 21.5% (s.e. = 5.3%), respectively (P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correction for alternative donor transplants did not substantially alter the survival of the group without a donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the survival in the various cytogenetic risk groups was not significantly different when comparing the donor vs the no-donor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This analysis shows that patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> may benefit from both allogeneic and autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We were unable to demonstrate a survival advantage for patients with a donor compared to patients without a donor </plain></SENT>
