<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with allo-HSCT, out of them 9 patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related donors, while 5 donors were unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1 patient received bone marrow transplantation and other 13 patients received peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modified BU/CY conditioning regimen was used in 11 patients, TBI+CY in 2 patients and reduced intensity FB conditioning regimen in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CsA + MTX + MMF were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with allo-HSCT from unrelated donors or HLA-mismatched donors received rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 12 ALL patients successfully reconstructed their haematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time from transplantation to ANC &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/L and Plt &gt; 50 x 10(9)/L were 12 (11 - 16) days and 13 (11 - 19) day after transplantation respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>11 patients survival free disease and their longest survival time had been up to 125 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1 case died early because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1 case died at 66 day because of aGVHD IV, alimentary tract <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and multiple organ failure.1 case relapsed at 8 months and died of marrow failure at 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over survival (OS) rate was 78.6% and disease free survival (DFS) was 84.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main complications were aGVHD of I-II grade in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that allo-HSCT is a safe and effective option for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
