<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were remarkably abnormal levels in seven cases; namely, four cases showed increased hexokinase activity, three cases showed increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase activity, and two cases showed increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these, one case with elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase activity showed the novel expression of M2-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase activity, in addition to the R-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase activity normally found in erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting of peripheral leucocyte DNA revealed only an amplified PK-LR genome, which derived from the chromosomal abnormality of a 1;7 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for switching M2-type to R-type during erythroid maturation was considered to be partially disrupted in this case </plain></SENT>
