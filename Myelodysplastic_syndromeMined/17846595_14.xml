<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy consecutive patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> underwent transplant and 25 (36%) relapsed, a median of 120 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of bone marrow blasts at relapse was 24, the median donor chimerism was 73% and new karyotypic abnormalities occurred in 8 out of 20 (40%) evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (84%) received aggressive treatment for relapse, including chemotherapy (60%), second hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; 52%) and/or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI; 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen achieved a complete response (CR) and four remain in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) after relapse was 6 months (95% confidence interval=2.7-9.9 months), and actuarial 1 year OS was 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to disease progression (17/20, 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not observe an advantage for cellular therapy (DLI or second transplant) compared to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapy for relapse after reduced intensity HCT is feasible, associated with low treatment-related mortality, and may result in prolonged survival in select patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies exploring the optimal treatment for relapse following reduced intensity HCT are warranted </plain></SENT>
