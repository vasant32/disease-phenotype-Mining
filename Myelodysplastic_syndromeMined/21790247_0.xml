<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involved in regulation of differentiation and proliferation, IRF-1 acts as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene and is inactivated by deletion of its one or more exons (exon skipping) in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples, extracted from peripheral blood, taken from 50 Kashmiri <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subjects, were analysed using the polymerase chain reaction and compared with examples of age and gender matched healthy controls from the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different exon regions (2, 3 and 4) of the IRF-1 gene that were previously shown to be prone to deletion were selected for amplification and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion was observed in 31(62%) out of 50 AML patients (p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 3 was most frequently deleted (58%), followed by exon 2 (28%), while exon 4 was least affected (12%), providing insights into critical roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of deleted exons was variable, but single exon deletions were more frequent (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of interest, IRF-1 gene deletions were not observed in 19 (38%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study, the frequency of deletions of these three exons was slightly higher than in an Indian population (52%), but lower than in Sweden in Europe (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study also explored the prevalence and clinical profile of IRF-1 deletions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adults had a significantly higher incidence than children (p=0.0168) and IRF-1 deletions were associated with low Hb (p&lt; 0.0001), high TLC (p=0.0033) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> (p=0.0076) </plain></SENT>
