<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Yisui Jiedu Recipe (YSJDR), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on cytokines and their corresponding just another kinase 2-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (JAK2-STAT5) signal transduction pathway in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fluorogenic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) method was established to detect the levels of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions, and JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction pathway was activated by granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in cultured bone marrow hematopoietic cells from 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), gamma-interferon (gamma-INF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the cultural supernatant of untreated control, AG490-treated and YSJDF-treated cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha in YSJDR-treated group were significantly lower than those in untreated control group and AG490-treated group (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05), and IL-3 level in YSJDP-treated group was remarkably higher than that in the other two groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2 and IL-3 between AG490-treated group and untreated control group (P&gt;0.05), while the TNF-alpha level in AG490-treated group was decreased obviously as compared with the untreated control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in gamma-INF level between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group (P&gt;0.05), while TNF-alpha level in the two groups were significantly lower than that in the untreated control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were significantly down-regulated in the YSJDR-treated and the AG490-treated groups as compared with those in the untreated control group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), while there were no differences in the expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: YSJDR can modulate cytokine level in bone marrow hematopoietic cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA, suppress JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction, and inhibit the Bcl-xL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
