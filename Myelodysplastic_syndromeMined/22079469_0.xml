<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report results of a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase II study designed to test the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> could be prevented by administration of oral BDP, beginning before hematopoietic cell transplantation and continuing until day 75 after hematopoietic cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study drug (BDP or placebo) was administered as 1-mg immediate-release formulation plus 1-mg delayed-release formulation orally four times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the primary endpoint, systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was given to 60 of the 92 participants (65%) in the BDP arm, versus 31 of 46 participants (67%) in the placebo arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary efficacy endpoints showed no statistically significant differences between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of participants who took at least 90% of the prescribed study drug during the first 4 weeks after hematopoietic cell transplantation was 54% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower severity of mucositis strongly correlated with higher adherence to the schedule of study drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent adherence related to mucositis during recovery after myeloablative conditioning may have obscured a beneficial therapeutic effect in the current study </plain></SENT>
