<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes involved mostly encode transcription factors and cell cycle specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this project was to study the DNA methylation pattern of c-myc, c-fos and p53 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (ANLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was isolated from the monocyte cell layer harvested from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of 44 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was digested with methylation-specific enzymes, and was electrophoresed and hybridized with probes specific for human c-myc, c-fos and p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the c-myc gene in exons 2 and 3 was regionally hypomethylated, whereas exon 2 in ANLL was hypermethylated and exon 3 hypomethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c-fos gene was hypomethylated in ANLL type 4 and presented aberrant hypomethylation in the different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p53 anti-oncogene appeared extensively hypomethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aberrant DNA methylation pattern of the c-myc, c-fos and p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene seems to be a primary event in the transformation process from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, affecting their expression, and, consequently, altering the proliferation, differentiation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hemopoietic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p53 hypomethylation predisposes to critical mutations that enhance the transformation process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recognition of altered methylation of these genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> may have prognostic implications and may lead to novel therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
