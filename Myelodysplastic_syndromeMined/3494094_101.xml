<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the in vivo effects of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in primates (cynomolgus monkeys) treated with subcutaneous doses of rhG-CSF for 14-28 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent increase in the peripheral white blood cells (WBC) was seen, reaching a plateau after 1 wk of rhG-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elevation of WBC was due to an increase in the absolute neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that rhG-CSF is a potent granulopoietic growth and differentiation factor in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, rhG-CSF was able to shorten the time period of WBC recovery in two treated monkeys to 1 wk, as compared to more than 4 wk for the control monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its ability to significantly shorten the period of chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> may allow clinicians to increase the frequency or dosage of chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the increase in absolute numbers of functionally active neutrophils may have a profound effect in the rate and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the activities reported here indicate a potential role for rhG-CSF in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005541'>congenital agranulocytosis</z:hpo>, radiation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, and bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
