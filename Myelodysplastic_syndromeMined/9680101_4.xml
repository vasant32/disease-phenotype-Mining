<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wished to see if culture performance could be related to the presence of apoptotic cells in a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (12 patients) and other patients with peripheral blood cytopenias (six patients) which caused diagnostic difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between LTBMC or adherent cell growth and the presence of apoptotic cells in the original marrow sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A variable degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LTBMC profiles correlated well with diagnosis but were unrelated to the extent of intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is a much more ubiquitous process in disease than previously thought </plain></SENT>
