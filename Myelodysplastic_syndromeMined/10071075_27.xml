<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the supportive function of stromal cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) on CD34-positive hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation using a long-term bone marrow culture (LTMC) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary marrow stromal cells were obtained from 11 MDS RA patients and 12 healthy volunteers, and freshly prepared CD34-positive bone marrow cells from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject were inoculated onto the stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There seems to be three broad patterns of hematopoietic cell growth in the LTMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group, hematopoietic cells were maintained at near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (type A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second group, the number of hematopoietic cells increased within the first 5-10 days of culture, but declined to low levels at 15-20 days of culture as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (type B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the third group, the incidence of hematopoietic cells steadily declined from the beginning of the culture (type C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, apoptotic change of hematopoietic cells was very frequently observed in cultures with the type C stroma, which were especially defective for supporting CD34 + cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD95 on hematopoietic cells was induced by the type C stroma, however, production of fas ligand by the stromal cells was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a lack of hematopoietic supportive function in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA and also indicate that there is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of stromal function among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA patients </plain></SENT>
