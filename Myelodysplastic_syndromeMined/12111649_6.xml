<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although retrospective analysis were frequently undertaken, and many prognostic systems for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been proposed worldwide, few such studies have been performed and the effectiveness of different scoring systems have not yet been verified in independent patient populations in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this single center study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and compare the prognostic scoring systems in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in our Institution were studied retrospectively to identify significant prognostic factors and to assess the predictive value of 11 previously described prognostic systems, including French-American-British (FAB) classification, World Health Organization (WHO) classification, Mufti, Sanz, Morra, Aul, Oguma, Toyama, Morel and international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years (range 13-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2- and 5-year survival rate of the patients were 55.22+/-4.90% and 26.09+/-6.36% respectively, with a median survival of 31 months (range 1-127 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (39.1%) had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) with a median time of 8 months (range 1-43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major independent variables indicated by multivariate analysis were the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blast cells and complex karyotype aberrations for survival (P=0.042 and 0.042, respectively) and only the percentage of BM blast cells for AL transformation (P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the systems except Mufti scores successfully discriminated risk groups concerning both survival and AL evolution, especially in the high risk group, ranging from 10 to 20 months and from 4 to 7 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FAB and WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS possessed lower P value (P&lt;0.0001) than that of the rest scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patients in our study were younger than these of the Western population, whereas the survival and AL transformation ratio were comparable to these previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BM blast proportion and complex chromosomal defects were highly significant for predicting outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most investigated systems effectively stratified patients into groups with different life expectancies and identified a subset of patients with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The FAB, WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS scoring systems were more applicable for predicting survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
