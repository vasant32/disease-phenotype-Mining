<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, little is known about the role of cell proliferation in compensating for the BM failure syndrome and in determining patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the proliferation index (PI) of different compartments of BM hematopoietic cells in 106 MDS patients compared to both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/reactive BM (n = 94) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 30 cases) using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show abnormally increased overall BM proliferation profiles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> which significantly differ between early/low-risk and advanced/high-risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early/low-risk patients showed increased proliferation of non-lymphoid CD34(+) precursors, maturing neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells (NRBC), while the PI of these compartments of BM precursors progressively fell below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> levels in advanced/high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased proliferation of non-lymphoid CD34(+) and NRBC precursors was significantly associated with adverse disease features, shorter overall survival (OS) and transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, both in the whole series and when low- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were separately considered, the PI of NRBC emerging as the most powerful independent predictor for OS and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, assessment of the PI of NRBC, and potentially also of other compartments of BM precursors (e.g.: myeloid CD34(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>), could significantly contribute to a better management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
