<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is now well known that the initial phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) involves cytokine release during preconditioning of the recipient of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF), in particular, has been implicated in pathological damage and is released pretransplant due to irradiation and cytotoxic preconditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a natural <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> of TNF, may be involved in downregulation of these responses, which may be an individual patient-specific effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the genotype for polymorphisms associated with TNF and IL-10 in 80 potential allo-BMT recipients and correlated the genotype with the severity of GVHD in 49 patients for whom clinical data relating to GVHD was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The widely studied TNF -308 polymorphism does not show any significant associations, but the d3 homozygous allele of the TNFd microsatellite is preferentially associated with grade III/IV GVHD (7 of 11 patients) compared with its occurrence in 8 of 38 patients with grade 0/II GVHD (P =.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alleles of the IL-10 (-)1064 promoter region microsatellite polymorphism that possess greater numbers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> (CA) repeats also significantly associate with more severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region has been demonstrated to be important in the regulation of the IL-10 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 38 patients with grade 0-II GVHD possessed alleles with greater numbers (12 or more) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeats, compared with 9 of 11 cases with grade III-IV GVHD (P &lt;.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 patients with grade 0-II GVHD, 3 of 38 had a both TNFd3/d3 and IL-10 (12-15) genotype, compared with 6 of 11 patients with grade III-IV GVHD (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association of either the TNFd or IL-10 microsatellite polymorphisms with mortality (P =.43 and.51, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patient cytokine gene polymorphism genotypes may influence GVHD outcome by affecting cytokine activation during the pretransplant conditioning regimens, and these results are the first to suggest a genetic predisposition to this important transplant-related complication </plain></SENT>
