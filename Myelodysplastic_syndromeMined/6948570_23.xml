<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ferrokinetics allowed three distinct groups of patients to be defined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were characterized by relative marrow failure and had a high likelihood of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the other end of the spectrum, individuals with primary acquired sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> had high erythropoietic activity which was largely ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had a benign clinical course without evidence of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the middle group, in terms of erythropoietic activity, lay patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with cellular marrow and a few individuals with primary acquired sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that separate entities may exist within the spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, they may be recognized by morphological studies and other simple laboratory means </plain></SENT>
