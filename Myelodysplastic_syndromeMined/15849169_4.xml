<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing CD45 and CD34 but lacking CD38 and lineage antigens (CD45+CD34+CD38-Lin- cells) are well-documented hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>), and CD45+CD34-CD38-Lin- cells are probably less mature <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> site is a matter of debate, and CD45+CD34+CD38-Lin- <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> were recently reported to be clonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study reported here, we detected CD45-CD34-CD38-Lin- cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and isolated them by successive application of density centrifugation, magnetic cell sorting, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that CD45-CD34-CD38-Lin- cells had the same chromosomal aberration as the myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to CD45- and CD34-, they lacked CD117 and CD133 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Generally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells have extremely reduced hematopoietic potential compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells, but we documented the following in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freshly isolated CD45-CD34-CD38-Lin- cells did not form any hematopoietic colonies but had long-term culture-initiating cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When cocultured with stroma cells, CD45-CD34-CD38-Lin- cells showed only weak potential for proliferation and differentiation, yet they differentiated into CD34+ cells and then mature myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This newly identified cell population represents the most immature immunophenotype so far identified in the hematopoietic lineage and is involved in the malignant clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
