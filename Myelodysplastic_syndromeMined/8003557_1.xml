<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> underwent treatment with IL-3: eight patients at dose levels of 250 and 500 micrograms/m2 s.c. daily for 15 days, and seven patients at the dose levels of 60 and 125 micrograms/m2 s.c. three times per week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had reported infectious episodes or been under treatment with cytotoxic drugs and/or cytokines within the preceding 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sIL-2R levels were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>sIL-2R increased in the high-dose treatment group from 504 +/- 68 U/ml to 731 +/- 199 U/ml (p &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased sIL-2R expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be a primary event due to involvement of lymphocytes in the malignant clone or due to a secondary alteration of the cytokine network caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A down-regulation of the immune response caused by neutralization of free IL-2 by sIL-2R during IL-3 therapy seems possible </plain></SENT>
