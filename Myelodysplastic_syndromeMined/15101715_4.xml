<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD178 (Fas ligand/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 ligand) and CD137 ligand (CD137L), 2 molecules involved in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, have previously been found in sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and have been hypothesized to participate in the pathogenesis of various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and found that while time to progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> correlated with the IPSS score there was no correlation of CD137L or CD178 serum levels with this score or with karyotype, bone marrow blast count or cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when cut-off-values for significant differentiation between cases with higher/lower levels of these molecules were determined we found that high levels of soluble CD137L (sCD137L) and low serum levels of soluble CD178 (sCD178) correlate with statistical significance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of disease as estimated by log-rank-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, low levels of sCD137L and high levels of sCD178 correlate significantly with prolongation of time to progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that serum levels of sCD137L and sCD178 represent valuable novel indicators for prognosis and disease progression and may be a useful parameter for treatment decisions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
