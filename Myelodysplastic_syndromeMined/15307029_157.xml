<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of findings from a preliminary study of 30 candidemic subjects and 30 healthy adults, a serum BG level of &gt;or=60 pg/mL was chosen as the cutoff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Testing was performed with serial serum samples obtained from 283 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who were receiving antifungal prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 1 serum sample was positive for BG at a median of 10 days before the clinical diagnosis in 100% of subjects with a proven or probable IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFIs included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">candidiasis</z:e>, fusariosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trichosporonosis</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of a positive BG finding had a 100% negative predictive value, and the specificity of the test was 90% for a single positive test result and &gt;or=96% for &gt;or=2 sequential positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Glucatell serum BG detection assay is highly sensitive and specific as a diagnostic adjunct for IFI </plain></SENT>
