<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are common signs of such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As prognosis and treatment of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are different, it is extremely important to make a differential diagnosis for the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 31 patients with CAA and 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemogram, bone marrow smear and biopsy for those patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean counts of monocytes and platelets in the peripheral blood of the CAA patients were significantly lower than those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow smear showed a reduction of cellularity in CAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean counts of myeloblasts+promyelocytes, myeloblasts+proerythroblasts, and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow of CAA patients were markedly lower than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But the mean lymphocyte count was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells showed morphological abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow biopsy decreased obviously in more than 96% of the patients with CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue in the bone marrow of CAA patients increased obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A reduction or deficiency (&lt;2 cell/piece) of megakaryocytes was noted in 28 patients with CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fibrous tissue in the bone marrow was detected in 5 patients with CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy results showed hypercellular changes in 12 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ten patients showed aggregated erythroblasts which were in the same stage of development, and 15 patients had abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood cell counts can be decreased in addition to the reduction of cellularity in the bone marrow without dyshematopoiesis in CAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood monocytes, fibrous tissue and cellularity in bone marrow are increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Dyshematopoiesis and ALIP may appear characteristically in the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Histology of bone marrow is important in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CAA </plain></SENT>
