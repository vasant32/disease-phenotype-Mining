<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently it has also been considered as a drug of promise in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), especially in older patients, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of R115777 used alone or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>): cladribine (2-CdA) and fludarabine (F-ara-A) on leukemic progenitors [colony-forming unit-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CFU)-L] from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our studies were based on the methods of semisolid leukemic CFU-L and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (CFU-GM) cultures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R115777 was added to the culture alone or in combinations with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that R115777 used alone or together with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> CFU-L, when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the drugs used in combinations of two higher concentrations in significantly higher degree inhibited CFU-L colony growth, when compared either with R115777 or with any of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> used alone (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IC(50) for R115777 were 67.1 and 121.9 nm for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> CFU-L and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> the combination index was 0.89 and 1.16, respectively, for the combination of R115777 with 2-CdA and R115777 with F-ara-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An additive effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> CFU-L cells and subadditive effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To assess a proapoptotic effect, the drugs were added to the liquid cultures at the same concentrations as for clonogenic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by combinations of drugs in comparison with single agents was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination of R115777 with both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> could be more effective than the drugs used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further experimental studies on the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients are warranted </plain></SENT>
