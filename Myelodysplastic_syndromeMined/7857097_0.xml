<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was morphologically based on the criteria of FAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, 9 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 1 had RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 6 had RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t), and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors involved in survival times and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were analyzed in these patients; FAB classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, age, sex, peripheral blood cell counts, bone marrow examination, karyotype, numbers of blasts </plain></SENT>
