<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Secondary bone marrow (BM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are increasingly common, as a result of radio or chemotherapy administered to a majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> have increased BM cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which results in BM dysfunction (cytopenias), and an increased risk of developing fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we asked whether TNF-alpha, known to regulate cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, could modulate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that TNF-alpha is induced by irradiation and regulates BM cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to irradiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) mice, TNF-alpha deficient (TNF-alpha KO) mice or WT mice treated with a TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibody were partially protected from the apoptotic effects of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next we established a 3-cycle irradiation protocol, in which mice were sub-lethally irradiated once monthly over a 3 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this model, irradiated WT mice presented loss of microsatellite markers on BM cells, low white blood cell (WBC) counts, reduced megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, phenoypes that suggest the irradiation protocol resulted in BM dysfunction with clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TNF-alpha KO mice were protected from the irradiation effects: BM cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following irradiation was significantly reduced, concomitant with sustained BM MK numbers and absence of other cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, irradiated WT mice with long term (&gt; or = 5 months) BM dysfunction had increased BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, MMPs and VEGF and NFkB p65, suggestive of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data shows that TNF-alpha induction following irradiation modulates BM cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and is a crucial event in BM dysfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression </plain></SENT>
