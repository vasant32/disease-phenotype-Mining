<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our cohort of 10 patients and 34 patients reported in the English literature in addition to ten cohort studies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) of the association between AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment could be targeted against AD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or both, though based on recent reports, treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with hypomethylating agents alone could improve the associated AD </plain></SENT>
