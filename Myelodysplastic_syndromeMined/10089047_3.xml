<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine any association between GBV-C/HGV positivity and different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e>, we investigated two groups of patients, one with clonal stem cell disease with long latency period (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>) and one with malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Virus positivity was compared with the data from cytogenetic analysis at first diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GBV-C/HGV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in these patients was studied using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and E2 antibody assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum GBV-C <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was found in 29/47 (62%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of GBV-C <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the group of oncological cases (72%) was significantly higher (P= .02) than in the patients with clonal stem cell diseases (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the GBV-C negative cases, only 25% had malignant haematological diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data from GBV-C/ HGV tested cases for which cytogenetic analysis was carried out indicated an association of GBV-C/HGV positivity with genomic destabilization in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the cases with numerical and structural aberrations, 64% were GBV-C positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A correlation could not be confirmed between GBV-C/HGV and liver enzyme levels, blood transfusions, chemotherapy treatment, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> coinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a high risk of GBV-C/HGV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> especially in the group of malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations may indicate that the persistence of GBV-C/HGV in these patients could be associated with susceptibility to genomic destabilisation </plain></SENT>
