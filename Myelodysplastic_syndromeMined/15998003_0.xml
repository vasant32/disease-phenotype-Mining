<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is presentation of case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumoconiosis</z:e> coexisting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in a former coal miner occupationally exposed to coal dust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a mineral coal miner, aged 56 year, with a 15-year duration of work underneath, suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumoconiosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to the hospital, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's condition was gradually worsening, even though chemotherapy was applied, he died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> manifested by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the digestive tract in a relatively short time since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presented case seems to be interesting not only in view of possible development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumoconiosis</z:e> as a result of occupational exposure to coal dust, typical in this case, but also in view of the occurrence of clonal disease of blood several years after cessation of exposure </plain></SENT>
