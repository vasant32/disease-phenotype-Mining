<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted with bulky abdominal masses of B cell lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy of the Vanderbilt regimen, the patient underwent ASCT with high dose chemotherapy of the BEAC regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She also received radiation of 48 Gy for the residual periportal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty two months after the ASCT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was noted and her bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic hemopoiesis with myeloblasts up to 12% of nonerythroid nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
