<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were performed on two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient was a 68 year old Japanese male in whose bone marrow cells two translocations were established, i.e., t(4;11)(q13;q23) and t(11;17)(q11?;q11), as well as other karyotypic changes (-6,-18,15p+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other patient was a 74 year old white male whose bone marrow cells showed six marker chromosomes, i.e., der(5),t(5;17)(q12;q11), der(6),t(6;5)(q27;q22), der(8),t(8;11;?)(q11;q11----q23;?), der(11),t(11;?)(q11;?), an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome #8, and a small G-group sized marker chromosome of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though the translocation patterns in the abnormal cells in these two cases were different, the breakpoints of the marker chromosomes were almost the same, i.e., 11q11, 11q23, and 17q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, changes of chromosome #6 were observed; the first case showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 6 and the second a 6q+ marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, common sites of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003220'>chromosome breakage</z:hpo> and reunion of 11q23 and 17q11 were close to recently established sites of human cellular oncogene homologs, c-ets (11q23) and c-erbA (17q21----24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations draw attention to a possible relationship between chromosome changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and oncogene (or other gene) activation and/or dysfunction </plain></SENT>
