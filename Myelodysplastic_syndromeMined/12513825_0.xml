<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antigen expression of a panel of antigens expressed in marrow cells from 30 patients with subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was assayed by alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression of myeloid antigens appeared abnormality, CD13 and CD33, found on granulocyte and macrophage precursors, increased, and CD15 decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes for monocytic antigen CD14 and lymphoid antigens CD7 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34 was increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and was not increased in RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD71, expressed by erythroblast and proliferative cells, was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the bone marrow cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed abnormality of more than two series of immunophenotypes, detection of immunophenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells might be contributed to the diagnosis and predicting prognosis </plain></SENT>
