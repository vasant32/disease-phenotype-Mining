<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between exposure to pesticides and LHC in an agricultural region of Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A structured questionnaire was employed in a hospital-based case control study to gather information on demographics, occupation, exposure to pesticides, agricultural practices, family and medical history and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To control for confounders, backward conditional and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the dose-response relationship between exposure and disease, the chi-square test for trend was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-four (354) histologically confirmed LHC cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 and 455 sex- and age-matched controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">Pesticide</z:chebi> exposure was associated with total LHC cases (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.51) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dose-response pattern was observed for total LHC cases (P = 0.004), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.024) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking during application of pesticides was strongly associated with total LHC cases (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.81-5.98), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.18-12.11), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (OR 10.15, 95% CI 2.15-65.69) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-8.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association was even stronger for total LHC cases (OR 18.18, 95% CI 2.38-381.17) when eating simultaneously with <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> application </plain></SENT>
