<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 29 year old woman with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000133'>pure gonadal dysgenesis</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi> investigations showed discrepancy between serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FSH levels remained elevated while LH levels decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FSH to LH ratio was 10 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 2-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fall in LH is likely to be due to factor(s) involved directly and specifically in LH synthesis and release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous LH releasing hormone administration as well as hormonal replacement treatment increased LH levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FSH to LH ratio decreased to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case supports the hypothesis of differential regulation of FSH and LH, and that FSH secretion is at least partly autonomous </plain></SENT>
