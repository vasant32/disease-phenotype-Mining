<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The DNA hypomethylating drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (DAC) reactivates silenced gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and is approved for the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene reactivation after DAC is variable and incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we established a cell line system (YB5) derived from the SW48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line to study DAC-induced reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>YB5 contains a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the locus is transcriptionally silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFP reexpression can be achieved by DAC treatment, but the expression level of individual cells is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAC-treated YB5 cells were separated into GFP-positive and GFP-negative subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By comparing DAC-treated sorted GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we found that their methylation levels were similarly decreased but that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 densities were remarkably different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar degree of (incomplete) DNA hypomethylation, GFP-positive cells reverted to an active chromatin structure marked by higher H3K9 acetylation, lower H3K27 trimethylation, and lower promoter nucleosome density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GFP-negative cells had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and promoter nucleosome density, similar to parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On DAC withdrawal, gradual resilencing and remethylation occurred in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, and the resilencing correlated with a gradual increase in nucleosome occupancy in GFP-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data show that hypomethylation alone after DAC is insufficient for gene expression induction, and that chromatin resetting to an active state including nucleosome eviction is required for activation of protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that gene expression is the key in optimizing DAC treatment strategies in the clinic </plain></SENT>
