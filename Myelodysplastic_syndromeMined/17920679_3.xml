<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were administered 10mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> intravenously for 10 days, 40mg/day <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> orally for 2 weeks and 100mg/day thalidomide orally for 4 weeks per cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After at least two treatment cycles, 10 patients showed hematologic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One achieved CR, one achieved PR, three patients achieved major hematological improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy rate was 24% (5/21), and the response rate was 48% (10/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The schedule was tolerated well by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and toxicities were moderate and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> and thalidomide could have therapeutic benefit in higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with safety </plain></SENT>
