<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multicenter study, 67 patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) were treated with a continuous oral dose of 200-300 mg of lonafarnib and were evaluated for hematologic, pathologic and pharmacodynamic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 70 years (range 44-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-20 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t-12) and 35 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 16 (24%) of the patients responded with two patients achieving a complete remission and one a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were seen in 6/32 and 10/35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients who were platelet transfusion-dependent prior to treatment, 5 (26%) became transfusion-free for a median duration of 185 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the farnesylation of the HDJ-2 protein measured in patient-derived cells was observed in the majority of patients during treatment with lonafarnib, but no clear correlation between changes in farnesylation and clinical effect could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant with 19% of patients discontinuing therapy due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
