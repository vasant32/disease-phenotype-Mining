<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients receiving nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) were compared with 97 patients receiving myeloablative transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving NST were at high risk for treatment-related complications given that they were older, 57 vs 43 years (P &lt; .001), and more likely had received previous or myeloablative transplantation (54% vs 2%; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of relapse was higher for patients after NST (61% vs 38%; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 100-day mortality was less after NST (15% vs 32%) Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 28% for NST and 34% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 20% for NST and 31% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that the intensity of the conditioning regimen had no effect on either OS or PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the high-risk features of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> undergoing NST, OS and PFS in these patients was similar to those in patients receiving myeloablative transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that dose intensity plays a significant role in control of disease after transplantation, but that this benefit is negated by increasing treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NST is a reasonable alternative for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at high risk for complications after myeloablative transplantation </plain></SENT>
