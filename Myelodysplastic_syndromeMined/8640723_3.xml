<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, unrelated single-cell abnormalities were found in six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most commonly encountered abnormalities present in the unrelated clones in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) were del(5q), +8, and -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In blastic types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was found in two of eight patients while in the remaining cases the chromosome abnormalities were diverse and nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the chromosomally unrelated clones, together with recent data on the early appearance of monoclonality provided by molecular biology studies, support the interpretation that aberrations such as +8 and del(5q) are actually secondary abnormalities that develop during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in a cell with a primary submicroscopic genomic rearrangement </plain></SENT>
