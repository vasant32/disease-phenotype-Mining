<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six cases were excluded due to unretrievable medical records or if analyzed only in remission or at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 1500 medical records were reviewed regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and clinical parameters in order to investigate possible associations between karyotypic pattern (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1, 2 or complex anomalies; specific abnormalities) and gender, age and morphological subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of time-period, i.e. 1976-87 vs. 1988-93, and referring center on cytogenetic findings was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 372 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 389 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 64 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) and 262 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) were identified, altogether 1087 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with other (n=261) or no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (n = 152) were excluded from the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 52% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 51 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 68% ALL and 97% <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, frequencies that did not differ significantly between the 2 time periods or referring centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant age- or gender-related differences in karyotypic patterns were discerned in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, ALL or <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, whereas the karyotypic patterns varied among the FAB groups in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (p= 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific abnormalities t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16) were more common (p &lt; 0.001) in younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and 5q- was more frequent in females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate, in contrast to previous series, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-associated karyotypic aberrations are not more common among older patients or in males </plain></SENT>
