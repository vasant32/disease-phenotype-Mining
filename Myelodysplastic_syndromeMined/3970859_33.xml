<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detailed study of 43 newly diagnosed cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) shows that many of the morphological features of blood and bone marrow are common to the different FAB groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is no clear distinction between the groups with regard to CFU-E, BFU-E or CFU-GM colony growth in vitro or ferrokinetic assessment of erythropoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interrelationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the parameters we have studied have been examined and there is little correlation between erythroid colony formation in vitro, the percentage erythroblasts in the bone marrow, erythroid output measured by ferrokinetics and the peripheral blood reticulocyte count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which appear to measure different aspects of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduced erythroid colony growth and a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> in vivo are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and appear to be an early manifestation of abnormal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreasing marrow iron turnover is more closely related to increasing numbers of marrow blast cells than any other index of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
