<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 113 patients with FA with cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 54), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 45), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 14) who were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 1985 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
