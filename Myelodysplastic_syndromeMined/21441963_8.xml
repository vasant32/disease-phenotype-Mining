<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared disease status, donor, graft and recipient characteristics with outcomes of 3731 MA with 1448 RIC/NMA procedures performed at 217 centers between 1997 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year univariate probabilities and multivariate relative risk outcomes of relapse, TRM, disease-free survival (DFS) and OS are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted OS at 5 years was 34, 33 and 26% for MA, RIC and NMA transplants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NMA conditioning resulted in inferior DFS and OS, but there was no difference in DFS and OS between RIC and MA regimens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies comparing regimens are needed to confirm this finding and determine the optimal approach to patients who are eligible for either MA or RIC/NMA conditioning </plain></SENT>
