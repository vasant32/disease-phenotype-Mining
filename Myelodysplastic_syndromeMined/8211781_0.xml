<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter, however, was accompanied with the highest count of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive EC, uneffective erythropoiesis being present in both RA and RABE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In sideroblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> the above proliferation was also inhibited, but uneffective erythropoiesis played much more pronounced role in pathogenesis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> than in RA and RABE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive EC averaged 39.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings contribute to more profound understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> syndrome, to more accurate evaluation of therapeutic effect and prognosis in the above disease </plain></SENT>
