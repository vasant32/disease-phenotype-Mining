<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had adequate cytogenetic studies, and 16 (48%) had one or more abnormal studies: nine initially, and seven more on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic clonal variation was frequent, including disappearance of clones, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, and appearance of new clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated five-year survival with a cytogenetic clone is 0.40, compared to 0.94 without a clone </plain></SENT>
