<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liposomal encapsulation of DNR (DaunoXome, DNX) seems to reduce the risk of this severe side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the toxicity of DNX in heavily pretreated patients, we conducted a phase I trial, including patients (pts) older than 60 years with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNX was used at doses of 40, 60, 75 and 90 mg/m(2), biweekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with a median age of 69 years (range, 63-77) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 courses of DNX were administered [3 pts at 40 mg/m(2) (for a total of 13 courses), 5 at 60 mg/m(2) (20 courses), 4 at 75 mg/m(2) (12 courses), and 2 at 90 mg/m(2) (4 courses)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean cumulative dose of DNX administered was 340 mg (range, 120-1200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 20% decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without clinical signs and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was noted in 2 patients after a cumulative DNX dose of 480 mg, both with pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using DNX dosages of 40 to 90 mg/m(2) biweekly seems to have little anti-leukemic activity in a patient population heavily pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
