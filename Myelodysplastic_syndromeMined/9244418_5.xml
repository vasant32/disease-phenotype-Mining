<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparative cytomegalovirus (CMV) diagnostic study was carried out on 30 bone marrow transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from these patients were examined for CMV by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), shell vial and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In parallel, peripheral blood samples were subjected to CMV antigenemia assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMV was detected in 12 (27.9%) of the 43 BALF samples (10 samples in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> culture, 10 samples in PCR, eight samples in shell vial and three samples in cytology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CMV antigenemia assay yielded a positive result for six samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates of agreement between results of the CMV antigenemia assay and results of each of the BALF tests were as follows: 81.4% with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> culture, 76.7% with PCR, 86.0% with shell vial, and 88.4% with cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the sensitivity of the CMV antigenemia assay was inferior to the sensitive tests of BALF samples, statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the CMV antigenemia assay, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> culture, shell vial and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the CMV antigenemia assay was shown to be useful for detection of CMV, it may be necessary to confirm not only the sensitivity but also the specificity of this method for prevention of CMV disease after BMT </plain></SENT>
