<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the feasibility of clofarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> combinations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Questions remain as to (1) the therapeutic advantage of this combination and (2) the role of lower doses of clofarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have conducted an adaptively randomized study of lower-dose clofarabine with or without low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in previously untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> aged 60 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 30 mg/m(2) clofarabine intravenously daily for 5 days with or without 20 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> subcutaneously daily for 14 days as induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consolidation consisted of 3 days of clofarabine with or without 7 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 71 years (range, 60-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received clofarabine and 54 the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 56% achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CR rate was significantly higher with the combination (63% vs 31%; P = .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Induction mortality was 19% with the combination versus 31% with clofarabine alone (P = .276) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination showed better event-free survival (7.1 months vs 1.7 months; P = .04), but not overall survival (11.4 months vs 5.8 months; P = .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clofarabine plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> has a higher response rate than clofarabine alone with comparable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NCT00088218 </plain></SENT>
