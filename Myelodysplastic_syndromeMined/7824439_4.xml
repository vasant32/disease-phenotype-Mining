<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow abnormalities</z:e> have been documented by case reports as well as retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present prospective analysis we addressed the question of the frequency and features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow abnormalities</z:e> in SLE patients presenting peripheral blood cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 12 of the 21 patients examined, we found foci of an exudative necrotic reaction characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, necrotic cells (nucleophagocytosis) and an infiltrate by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reticulin fibers were increased in these foci in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, hemopoiesis was hyperplastic in only 6 patients, but was grossly diminished in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients atypical elements of one or more cell lines could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most commonly (11 cases), an increase in megakaryocytes with atypical elements showing small pleomorphic nuclei could be seen, together with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell atypia in the erythroid line was found in 8 cases, and abnormal granulocytic precursors were seen in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No ring sideroblasts could be observed in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these features provide persuasive evidence that the bone marrow is a common target organ affected by autoaggression in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Central and peripheral mechanisms acting to produce peripheral cytopenias must be assumed in most cases </plain></SENT>
