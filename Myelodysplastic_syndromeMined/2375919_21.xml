<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two broad patterns of growth were revealed in LTBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one group the incidence of haemopoietic progenitor cells steadily declined to abnormally low levels at 4 weeks, while in a second group they were maintained near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels for periods of up to 7 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These growth patterns, which were not predictable from clonogenic assays on the marrow cells prior to LTBMC, or from the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the bone marrow, may reflect the stage of evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies of clonality are required to establish whether or not patients exhibiting the second pattern have a potentiality to harbour residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LTBMC was also used to study the function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow stroma in terms of its ability to sustain the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haemopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the phenotype of the cultured adherent cell layer, obtained from some patients, was atypical, no consistent functional defect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma could be identified by studying the level of haemopoiesis reached by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells seeded into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma </plain></SENT>
