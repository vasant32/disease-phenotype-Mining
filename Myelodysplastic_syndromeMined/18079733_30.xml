<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the characteristics of 856 patients with low or intermediate-1 disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 19.6 months (range 1-262) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 87 (10%) transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and 429 (50%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, characteristics associated with worse survival (P&lt;0.01) were low platelets, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, older age, higher percent of marrow blasts and poor-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not included in the model, higher ferritin (P=0.007) and beta2-microglobulin (P&lt;0.001) levels were associated with worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This allowed the development of a scoring system in which patients could be grouped in three categories: category 1 (n=182, 21%) with a median survival of 80.3 months (95% CI 68-NA); category 2 (n=408, 48%) with a median survival of 26.6 months (95% CI 22-32) and category 3 (n=265, 31%) with a median survival of 14.2 months (95% CI 13-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this analysis indicates that it is possible to identify patients with lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and poor prognosis who may benefit from early intervention </plain></SENT>
