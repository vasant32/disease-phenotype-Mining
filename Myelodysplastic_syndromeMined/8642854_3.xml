<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one adult patients (mean age 36 years, range 15-59) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> underwent ABMT in 1st CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of them had a prior diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; one patient had a secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median interval between CR and ABMT was 8 months (range 4-20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, 4 mg/kg/day for 4 days plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days or 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No maintenance chemotherapy was administered after ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median days to reach 0.5 x 10(9)/I PMN and 20 x 10(9)/I platelets were 26 (range 12-250) and 74 (range 16-740), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No transplant-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year actuarial overall survival rate is 76.9%; actuarial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival rate is 70.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up from ABMT is 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival of this group was compared with that of 38 non-transplanted patients younger than 60 years, who maintained a CR longer than 8 months in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis shows a statistically significant difference in favor of ABMT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, even if performed late after 1st CR as post-remission intensification, ABMT can improve the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
