<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 3q26.2 rearrangements are characteristically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and typically difficult to detect in poor quality metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To develop a dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay for the detection of 3q26.2/EVI1 aberrations, a series of 10 BAC clones corresponding to the EVI1 gene region were systematically evaluated and narrowed down to two probe sets; one probe set encompassed the EVI1 gene extending centromeric, while the second probe set covered the EVI1 gene and extends telomeric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both probe sets were evaluated on 35 patient samples with cytogenetically defined 3q26.2 rearrangements collected at various treatment time points, the inv(3)(q21q26.2) Kasumi-4 cell line, and 10 known negative samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two-probe set strategy identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, despite the vast breakpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, two 3q26.2 translocation samples had breakpoints 3' to EVI1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that, despite the extensive breakpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> observed with 3q26.2 aberrations, this FISH strategy is effective for the detection of 3q26.2 abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
