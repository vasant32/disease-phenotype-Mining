<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome associated with interaction between fentanyl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, as evidenced by medication history, clinical features and reversal following discontinuation of fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old patient chronically treated with the selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonic jerks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo>, consistent with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome, following initiation of fentanyl, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms and signs resolved following discontinuation of fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the Naranjo probability scale, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome was a probable adverse reaction associated with co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> and fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome is a potentially lethal pharmacodynamic interaction between medications that increase serotonergic transmission at the synaptic junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of new pharmacological agents with varied properties and actions has increased the risk of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome as a clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSRIs and fentanyl are commonly co-administered, especially in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or malignant pain, as underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may contribute to the pathogenesis of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals should be aware of the possible development of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome as a complication of initiation of fentanyl and other phenylpiperidine opioids in patients treated with SSRIs </plain></SENT>
