<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess professional practices of hospital-based rheumatologists with regard to BMA in order to identify the relevant indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective observational study in patients hospitalised in a French university hospital was conducted between 2005 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients who had a BMA in the rheumatology department during the study period were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical indication, number and results of BMA and of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage and treatment of the haematological disease implemented following the BMA were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-seven BMAs and 79 BMBs were performed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the BMAs, 14.1 % were pathological: <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (n = 12), malignant B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Waldenstrom's disease</z:e> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 2), hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 14 pathological BMBs were associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMAs were performed equally for gammaglobulin abnormalities (monoclonal peak = 45 % of indications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> = 6 %) and for other reasons (haemogram abnormality = 24 %, skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002797'>osteolysis</z:hpo> = 6 %, unexplained inflammatory syndrome = 5 %, lymph node disease = 4 % and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In clinical rheumatology, BMA may reveal two major types of malignant haematological diseases: <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> with poor prognostic factors justifying polychemotherapy and autologous grafts and, in contrast, slowly evolving B cell lymphoid haemopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the additional risk in some types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatism</z:e>, BMB should be performed more frequently in certain specific situations (skeletal or lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and unexplained inflammatory syndrome) </plain></SENT>
