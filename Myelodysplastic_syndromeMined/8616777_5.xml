<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), from their HLA-matched brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis after the BMT revealed a chromosomal mosaicism in both patients, with the karyotype 46,XX/45,X with no sign of the Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The origin of the clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> X was determined using cytogenetic analysis including heteromorphism and segregation of DNA polymorphic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results led us to the conclusion that in both patients the origin of the 45,X clone was that of the donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-like syndrome after the BMT and was stabilized in the chimeric state; to date she is doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient II also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in her case, it was her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The graft in patient II was rejected and she died 6 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
