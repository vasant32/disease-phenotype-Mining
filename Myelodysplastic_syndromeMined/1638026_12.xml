<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of MGF on the in vitro growth of clonogenic leukemic precursor cells in the presence or absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and/or erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic blood and bone marrow cells from patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, as well as bone marrow samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MGF as a single factor did not induce significant colony formation by clonogenic leukemic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF, MGF weakly stimulated the colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF, MGF strongly induced both size and number of leukemic colonies from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the presence of EPO, MGF strongly stimulated erythroid colony formation by <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of the colonies showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases after 1 week of culture were derived from the leukemic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MGF strongly stimulated myeloid colony formation in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF (up to fourfold), and erythroid colony formation in the presence of EPO (up to eightfold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Not only the number, but also the size of the colonies increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the presence of MGF, the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases increased in three patients tested after 1 week of culture compared with the initial suspension, suggesting that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> were preferentially stimulated compared with the preleukemic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of exogenous EPO and in the presence of 10% human AB serum, MGF in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF induced erythroid colony formation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, illustrating that MGF greatly diminished the EPO requirement for erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MGF may be a candidate as a hematopoietic growth factor to stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
