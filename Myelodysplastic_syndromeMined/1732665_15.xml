<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sections of undecalcified plastic embedded biopsies and smears of bone marrow aspirates were stained according to Giemsa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrows with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were characterized by three main categories of morphologic alterations: (1) cellular abnormalities, (2) architectural disorganization in the bone marrow and (3) stromal changes; the combined use of aspirates and trephine biopsies enabled a more reliable and accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than either one alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow findings fell into one of 7 subtypes, with the frequencies and median survivals in brackets: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> sideroblastic (19%, 62 months), (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> megaloblastoid (13%, 56 months), (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> proliferative (22%, 31 months), (4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blastic (15%, 9 months), (5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> hypoplastic (15%, 26 months), (6) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> fibrotic (6%, 29 months), and (7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> inflammatory (10%, 42 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follow-up studies patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> were excluded and the prognosis and subsequent evolution for each of the morphologic subtypes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is drawn that aspirates and trephine biopsies are complementary procedures and both are required for diagnosis, classification and decisions on current treatment modalities of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
