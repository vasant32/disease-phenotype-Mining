<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial but encouraging responses were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to further evaluate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> activity on the hemopoietic progenitor cells of myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> effects on in vitro growth of pre-treatment peripheral blood and bone marrow hemopoietic progenitor cells from myelodysplastic patients, and colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage and burst forming unit erythroid levels in the peripheral blood of 7 myelodysplastic patients during and following a 3-week treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> (200 mg/m2 i.v., three times a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No variations were observed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, platelets, white blood cells and reticulocyte values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood levels of both colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage and burst forming unit erythroid, however, showed a significant and sustained increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro a significant effect exerted by the drug was observed in single cases, but the in vitro effect did not predict the in vivo increase of peripheral blood levels of hemopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results appear to provide evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> has a significant impact on early events of hemopoiesis in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
