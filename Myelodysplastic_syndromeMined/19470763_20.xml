<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we purified RUNX-1-containing multiprotein complexes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>-induced L8057 murine megakaryoblastic cells and identified the ets transcription factor FLI-1 as a novel in vivo-associated factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction occurs via direct protein-protein interactions and results in synergistic transcriptional activation of the c-mpl promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the interaction fails to occur in uninduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gel filtration chromatography confirms the differentiation-dependent binding and shows that it correlates with the assembly of a complex also containing the key megakaryocyte transcription factors GATA-1 and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation analysis of FLI-1 with uninduced versus induced L8057 cells suggests the loss of phosphorylation at serine 10 in the induced state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substitution of Ser10 with the phosphorylation mimic aspartic acid selectively impairs RUNX-1 binding, abrogates transcriptional synergy with RUNX-1, and dominantly inhibits primary fetal liver megakaryocyte differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, substitution with alanine, which blocks phosphorylation, augments differentiation of primary megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that dephosphorylation of FLI-1 is a key event in the transcriptional regulation of megakaryocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for other cell types where interactions between runx and ets family proteins occur </plain></SENT>
