<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for at least the segments 1q22 to 1qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1q or material from 1q was translocated to another chromosome in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was chromosome 9 in four patients, and those cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> also for 9p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q was found at the time of diagnosis in three patients, later during the polycythemic phase in five, and in four patients when they were first examined during a late stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>Acute leukemia</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> developed in eight of the 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signs of advanced disease, eg, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in four cases and was noted in one more patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 1q was the most frequent structural chromosome abnormality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is thus one of several nonrandom abnormalities that can appear at any stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems to occur with higher frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but it is not a specific characteristic of these complications </plain></SENT>
