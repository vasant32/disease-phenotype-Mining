<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether there was also an excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in patients after transplantation and whether this might be related to a particular immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from more than 170 000 patients indicated that organ transplantation is associated with a significantly increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was more frequent after heart transplantation and lung transplantation than after kidney transplantation and was associated with immunosuppression by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> is associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment of human cells in vitro selects variants with defective MMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a similar selection in patient bone marrow, in 7 of 7 patients, transplant-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) exhibited the microsatellite instability (MSI) that is diagnostic for defective MMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because MSI occurs infrequently in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, we conclude that the selective proliferation of MMR-defective, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>-resistant myeloid cells may contribute significantly to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> in patients who have received organ transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identifying <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> suggests that discontinuing the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> as an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> might reduce the incidence of posttransplantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
