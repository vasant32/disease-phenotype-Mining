<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The involvement of 11q23-balanced translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> after treatment with drugs that inhibit the function of DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is being recognized with increasing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and others have shown that the gene at 11q23 that is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> is MLL (also called ALL1, Htrx, and HRX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the translocations in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> are the same as those occurring in de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [eg, t(9;11), t(11;19), and t(4;11)], with the treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> accounting for no more than 5% to 10% of any particular translocation type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the t(11;16)(q23;p13.3) and have shown that it involves MLL and CBP (CREB binding protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBP gene was recently identified as a partner gene in the t(8;16) that occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4) de novo and rarely in treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have studied eight t(11;16) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had prior therapy with drugs targetting topo II with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for MLL and a cosmid contig covering the CBP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both probes were split in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients and the two derivative (der) chromosomes were each labeled with both probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of an approximately 100-kb PAC located at the breakpoint of chromosome 16 from one patient revealed some variability in the breakpoint because it was on the der(16) in three patients, on the der(11) in another, and split in four others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assume that the critical fusion gene is 5'MLL/3'CBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our series of patients is unusual because three of them presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) most similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) and one other had dyserythropoiesis; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is rarely seen in 11q23 translocations either de novo or with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using FISH and these same probes to analyze the lineage of bone marrow cells from one patient with CMMoL, we showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mature monocytes contained the fusion genes as did some of the granulocytes and erythroblasts; none of the lymphocytes contained the fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The function of MLL is not well understood, but many domains could target the MLL protein to particular chromatin complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBP is an adapter protein that is involved in regulating transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is also involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation, which is thought to contribute to an increased level of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The fusion gene could alter the CBP protein such that it is constitutively active; alternatively, it could modify the chromatin-association functions of MLL </plain></SENT>
