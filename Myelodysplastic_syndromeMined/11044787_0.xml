<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is predominantly a disease of old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases diagnosed over the last 20 years has risen substantially due to increased awareness and improved geriatric care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is increasingly diagnosed, the prevalence and prognosis of early-stage affected elderly are not completely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, characteristics and prognosis of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients hospitalized in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> geriatric department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1993 and 1996, 3,275 patients hospitalized in the geriatric department of a teaching hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care or short-term rehabilitation were investigated for unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> comorbidities, cause of hospitalization, functional and cognitive status, hematological and other laboratory parameters were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.5%) patients had unexplained cytopenia, <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, of whom 37 (15%) were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 9 patients were hospitalized for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 28 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, cardiac, cerebrovascular events and other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), two had RA with ringed sideroblasts and 1 had RA with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was up to 70 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients in age, sex, comorbidities or laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison of survival curves (excluding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> case) according to demographic, clinical and hematological parameters has shown that only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> adversely affects survival, compared to cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of the RA type is a common and incidental finding in older hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is a frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> but has less significance on survival rates than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, although its full impact remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
