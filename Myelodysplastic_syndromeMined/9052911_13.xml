<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the short-term benefits of allogeneic blood stem cell transplants when compared to bone marrow transplants, we reviewed outcomes of 74 adults with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancer</z:e> transplanted from HLA-matched related donors after conditioning with thiotepa, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were three cohorts: group 1 received bone marrow transplants with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) for GVHD prophylaxis; group 2 received bone marrow transplants with CsA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MP); and group 3 received blood stem cells with CsA and MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received filgrastim post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median times (range) to neutrophils &gt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l were 17 (8-30), 9 (8-16) and 10 (8-13) days post-transplant, and to platelets &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/l were 28 (14-100+), 19 (13-100+) and 14 (9-86) days post-transplant for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 only for group 1 vs group 3 for both outcomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood stem cell recipients had the least regimen-related toxicity, fewest early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and earliest discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-day survivals (95% CI) were 53% (35-72%), 32% (10-53%), and 68% (49-87%) for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 only for group 2 vs group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For allogeneic transplantation, use of blood stem cell grafts has substantial advantages over marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
