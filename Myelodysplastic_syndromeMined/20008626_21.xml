<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of romiplostim, a peptibody that increases platelet production, for treatment of thrombocytopenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (International Prognostic Scoring System low or intermediate 1), a mean baseline platelet count &lt;or= 50 x 10(9)/L, and were only receiving supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received three injections of 300, 700, 1,000, or 1,500 microg romiplostim at weekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After evaluation of platelet response at week 4, patients could continue to receive romiplostim in a treatment extension phase for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 44 patients who enrolled completed the treatment phase; 41 patients continued into the extension phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet counts increased</z:e> throughout the study, from fewer than 30 x 10(9)/L at baseline to 60, 73, 38, and 58 x 10(9)/L at week 4 for the 300-, 700-, 1,000-, and 1,500 -microg dose cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A durable platelet response (per International Working Group 2000 criteria for 8 consecutive weeks independent of platelet transfusions) was achieved by 19 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events and platelet transfusions was less common among patients who achieved a durable platelet response than those who did not (4.3 v 39.3 per 100 patient-weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients (98%) reported one or more adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in five patients (11%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were in the 1,500-microg dose cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No neutralizing antibodies to either romiplostim or endogenous thrombopoietin were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Romiplostim appeared well-tolerated in this study and may be a useful treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
