<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was noted in survival for 153 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> receiving ABO identical or ABO mismatched allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients who had allografts that were bidirectionally incompatible (both donor cells and plasma incompatible) did have significantly poorer survival than the other recipients, similar to the experience reported in one other cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these patients had other risks for mortality, including being older and receiving transplants from matched, unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support a significant role for ABO donor-recipient matching in allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
