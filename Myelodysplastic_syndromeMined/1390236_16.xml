<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to find variables that could predict the response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had clinical symptoms related to cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood values, bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> histology and chromosomes were analysed before the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the patients was 9 months and a poor survival was predicted by advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo>, the presence of pseudo-Pelger <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and &gt; or = 2 chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (29%) responded with either a complete remission or a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 71%, the treatment was ineffective and in some cases hazardous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with a poor response to treatment could be divided into two groups: one included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> and the presence of chromosomal aberrations, both signs of progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a short survival, and the other comprised morphological findings, indicating ineffective haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with platelet counts &gt; 150 x 10(9)/l had a response rate of 55% compared to 23.5% in patients with subnormal platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression identified low bone marrow cellularity, absence of ring sideroblasts and &lt; 2 chromosomal aberrations as predictors of a favourable response in patients with platelet counts &lt; 150 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These factors and the platelet count were combined in a predictive model which can divide patients into three groups with different probabilities of response: a favourable group, 38.6% of the patients, with a response rate of &gt; 50%, an intermediate group, 32.7% of the patients, with a response rate of 24%, and an unfavourable group, 28.7% of the patients, with only 3% responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While low-dose ara-C is an effective treatment for some patients, it is ineffective and hazardous for others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We present a model that can facilitate therapeutic decision making in two-thirds of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> by identifying patients who should not be treated with low-dose ara-C as well as patients with a relatively high probability of response </plain></SENT>
