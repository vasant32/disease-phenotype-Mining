<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, there has been a long way to implement fully stem cell transplantation strategies into the treatment studies organized within BFM Groups for first line or second line treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of different risk groups, different donors, stem cell sources and alternative approaches as haploidentical transplantation as well have been studied as the impact of chimerism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and myelosdysplastic syndromes integrated treatment pathways have been developed, which integrate stem cell transplantation on an evidence base into the treatment of the patient </plain></SENT>
