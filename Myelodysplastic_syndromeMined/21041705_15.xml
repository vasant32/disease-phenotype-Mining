<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and experimental evidence suggests an immune-mediated pathophysiology in some patients, in whom immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with horse antithymocyte globulin (h-ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) can be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the toxicities associated with h-ATG/CsA, we investigated an alternative regimen with alemtuzumab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a nonrandomized, off-label, pilot, phase I/II study of alemtuzumab monotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were judged likely to respond to IST based on the following criteria: HLA-DR15-negative patients whose age plus the number of months of RBC transfusion dependence (RCTD) was less than 58; and HLA-DR15-positive patients whose age plus RCTD was less than 72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 121 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were screened, of whom 32 met eligibility criteria to receive alemtuzumab 10 mg/d intravenously for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were hematologic responses at 3, 6, and 12 months after alemtuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen (77%) of 22 evaluable intermediate-1 patients and four (57%) of seven evaluable intermediate-2 patients responded to treatment with a median time to response of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of seven evaluable responders with cytogenetic abnormalities before treatment had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics by 1 year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five (56%) of nine responding patients evaluable at 12 months had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts, and seven (78%) of nine patients were transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab is safe and active in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be an attractive alternative to ATG in selected patients likely to respond to IST </plain></SENT>
