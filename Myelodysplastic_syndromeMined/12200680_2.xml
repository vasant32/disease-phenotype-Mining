<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may be associated with an increased incidence of these complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our database of 379 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> ASCT patients treated with alkylator-based chemotherapy, followed for a median of 1.52 years (range 0-8.97), with a median survival of 6.16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients have developed tMDS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing this complication at 5 years is 0.032 in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have used pathologic, cytogenetic and molecular methods to evaluate which portions of therapy may have predisposed to the development of this complication </plain></SENT>
