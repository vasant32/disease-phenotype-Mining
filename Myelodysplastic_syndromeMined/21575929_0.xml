<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the incidence and significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2517 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> referred to our institution since 1993 were analyzed, with a specific focus on the incidence and associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the study group was 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts &lt;100 × 10(9)/L were noted in 65%, and platelets counts &lt;30 × 10(9)/L in 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each platelets count drop below the range of 200 × 10(9)/L has shown a larger magnitude change in terms of worsening effect on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, smaller ranges of platelet counts of &lt;200 × 10(9)/L were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet cutoffs of 30, 50, and 200 × 10(9)/L thus were identified to have significant associations with differences in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was associated with poor performance, other cytopenias, adverse karyotype, and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was associated with worse prognosis; it also was predicted for worse outcome within each of the International Prognostic Scoring System risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is directly associated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
