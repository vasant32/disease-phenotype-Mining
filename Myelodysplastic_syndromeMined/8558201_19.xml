<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study was conducted of 31 patients (median age, 41 years) treated with BU (7 mg/kg), CY (50 mg/kg), TBI (12 Gy), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (n = 23) or -mismatched (n = 2) related or unrelated donor (n = 6) marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with 44 historical control patients treated with CY (120 mg/kg) and TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate was similar for the BU/CY/TBI group and the CY/TBI group (23% v 30%, P = .6), but there were trends toward lower relapse rates (28% v 54%, P = .27) and higher nonrelapse mortality rates (68% v 36%, P = .12) among the current patients compared with historical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype pretransplant and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> as part of posttransplant immunosuppression were associated with improved survival and reduced nonrelapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed significant differences in relapse rates based on marrow source (57% for HLA genotypically matched marrow v 18% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others, P = .04) and on disease <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (66% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> v 38% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> tolerated the intensified BU/CY/TBI preparative regimen and reduced posttransplant immunosuppression poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel transplant procedures are needed to reduce relapse rates without increasing nonrelapse mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, transplantation before progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, if possible, may reduce the risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
