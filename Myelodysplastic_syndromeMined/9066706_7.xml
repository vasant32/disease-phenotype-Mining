<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, the number of transferrin receptors was increased on part of the erythroblasts thus facilitating iron uptake by the cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This leads to the conclusion that the ineffective response to iron therapy in cases of ACD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> can be explained by a decline of transferrin receptors on the red cells </plain></SENT>
