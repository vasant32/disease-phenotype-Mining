<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase bone marrow cells showed that the chromosomal rearrangement was restricted to the granulocyte lineage but was not present in the eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the chromosome rearrangement is important in the overproduction of eosinophils in this case, the lineage restriction found suggests that its effect must be indirect </plain></SENT>
