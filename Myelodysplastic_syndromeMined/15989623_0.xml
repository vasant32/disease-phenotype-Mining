<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A range of Phase I studies has been performed and a daily x 5 iv. schedule, which showed most promising evidence of activity, was selected for extensive clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, topotecan has been shown to be active in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic ovarian cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278727" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent small cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCLC</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, response rates of around 15% were identified in patients who had failed standard chemotherapy, and in a randomised, comparative study with paclitaxel response rates of 20% (topotecan) and 13% (paclitaxel) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, overall time to progression was impressive at 23 weeks (topotecan) compared with 14 weeks (paclitaxel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278727" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent SCLC</z:e>, topotecan has shown good activity in sensitive patients with a response rate of 39%, although the response rate in refractory patients was considerably lower (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 5.4 months, acceptable for this difficult clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topotecan is well-tolerated in the majority of patients and subjective toxicities are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The principal side-effect is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serious clinical sequelae are relatively uncommon and non-cumulative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonhaematological toxicities are generally mild and not dose-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In clinical use, topotecan has exhibited activity in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, with a side-effect profile that is predictable and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The drug is under evaluation in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types and in combination chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
