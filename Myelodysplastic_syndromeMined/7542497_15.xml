<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated stem cell involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunofluorescence labeling of hematopoietic subpopulations, and flow cytometric analysis/sorting to discriminate and quantify cytogenetically aberrant stem cells in 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and three myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis and sorting were used to discriminate and collect a primitive subpopulation enriched in stem cells expressing CD34+ and lacking CD33 and CD38 (CD34+lin-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subpopulation containing progenitors and differentiating myeloid cells expressed CD34, CD33, and CD38 (CD34+lin+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine specimens contained less than 10% CD34+ cells and, thus, were considered to be CD34- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mature lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid subpopulations were sorted on the basis of antigen-linked immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically aberrant cells in sorted subpopulations were identified using FISH with enumerator probes selected on the basis of diagnosis karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin- cells were present at frequencies between 9% and 99% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34+lin- cytogenetically aberrant cells comprised between 0.05% and 11.9% of the marrow/blood specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin+ cells constituted 0.01% tp 56% of the marrow/blood population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that aberrant cells are present in primitive CD34+ stem cell compartments, even in CD34- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stem cell involvement was confirmed further by sorting lymphoid and erythroid subpopulations from eight specimens in which the predominant leukemic population lacked lymphoid/erythroid differentiation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these specimens, as well as in multiple lineages, suggests involvement of a cell(s) with multilineage capabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ability of aberrant CD34+lin- stem cells to contribute to clonal and compartment expansion within immunofluorescently defined subpopulations was evaluated to explore the functional phenotype of aberrant CD34+lin- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of compartment size and aberrant cell frequency suggests that frequency of cytogenetically aberrant stem cells is uncoupled from compartment size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that cytogenetically aberrant cells in the primitive compartment show varying abilities to expand primitive compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin- cells precede the blast subpopulation in hierarchical maturation and may in some cases by considered preleukemic, requiring maturation or additional mutations before transformation (eg, compartmental expansion) occurs </plain></SENT>
