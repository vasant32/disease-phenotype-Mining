<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients were enrolled and treated by standard induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients that reached CR started maintenance therapy with subcutaneous azacytidine, 5/28 d until relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter-methylation status of CDKN2B (P15 ink4b), CDH1 and HIC1 was examined pre-induction, in CR and 6, 12 and 24 months post CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (40%) patients achieved CR after induction chemotherapy and 23 started maintenance treatment with azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median CR duration was 13.5 months, &gt;24 months in 17% of the patients, and 18-30.5 months in the four patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CR duration was not associated with CDKN2B methylation status or karyotype </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of CDH1 was significantly associated with low CR rate, early relapse, and short overall survival (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment, at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
