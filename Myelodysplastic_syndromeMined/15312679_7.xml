<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, including nine cell lines and 45 clinical samples (32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL), two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), one <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>), were examined to ask whether mutation of the CBP and p300 genes could be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The answer was approached by employing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR/SSCP) technique and subsequent sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A T-lymphoblastic cell line, CEM had an in-frame 21-base-pair deletion within the bromodomain of its p300 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA analysis revealed aberrant splicing caused by mutation of the acceptor site of intron 17 from ag to gg, which should interfere with catalytic step II of the pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 MDS patient, a missense mutation was detected, which caused a replacement from Ser to Gly at codon 507 of p300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of CBP/p300 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, which might be relatively rare but nonetheless contribute to pathogenesis in some fraction of cases </plain></SENT>
