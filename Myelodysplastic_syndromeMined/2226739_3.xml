<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom showed a bizarre nuclear anomaly within the neutrophils that was characterized by extensive clumping of chromatin into large blocks separated by clear zones, generally associated with a lack of segmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, variable leucocyte counts with leucoerythroblastic picture, marrow hypercellularity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012138'>granulocytic hyperplasia</z:hpo> and moderate dysplastic changes in erythroblastic and megakaryocytic lines were present at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and a 3 showed a deletion of chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5 out of 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival was short (5 months) and haemorrhagic complications were the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features and the evolution of these and other reported cases suggest that the presence of abnormal chromatin clumping in leucocytes might be a clue to a new subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
