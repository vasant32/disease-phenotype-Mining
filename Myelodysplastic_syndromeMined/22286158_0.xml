<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of posaconazole in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) undergoing chemotherapy in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Posaconazole concentrations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> receiving prophylactic posaconazole were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A population PK model with nonlinear mixed effect modeling was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The list of tested covariates included age, weight, height, gender, posaconazole dose, ethnicity, co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> chemotherapy, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi>, coincident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, leukocyte counts, and γ-glutamyltransterase plasma activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 643 serum concentrations of posaconazole from 84 patients were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination as the basic structural model appropriately described the data, with an apparent clearance of 56.8 L/h [95% confidence interval (CI) 52.8–60.8 L/h] and an apparent volume of distribution of 2,130 L (95% CI 1,646–2,614 L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant effects on apparent clearance (CL/F) were found for presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and for co-medication with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (1.5- and 1.6-fold increase in CL/F, respectively), weight (33.4 L larger apparent volume of distribution per kilogram), and co-administration of chemotherapy (0.6-fold lower apparent volume of distribution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We developed a prediction basis for mean posaconazole concentrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient weight, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and concomitant medication (chemotherapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi>) showed significant effects on posaconazole exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Corresponding adjustments of the starting dose according to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and during the co-administration of chemotherapy or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> appear justified before therapeutic drug monitoring results are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the interaction between different chemotherapeutic regimens and posaconazole is warranted </plain></SENT>
