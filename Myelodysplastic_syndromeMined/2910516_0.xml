<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C) has a differentiating effect in vitro, marrow cells from nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and eight non-leukemic controls were exposed to drug concentrations comparable to those achieved in vivo with low-dose Ara-C therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In soft agar cultures, the predominant effect of Ara-C at concentrations between 10(-8) M and 10(-6) M was cytotoxicity with a dose-dependent decrement in Colony Forming Unit of the granulocyte and monocyte lineage (CFUg/m) at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth in liquid cultures containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017525" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Giant Cell Tumor</z:e>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>)-conditioned media without Ara-C resulted in a significant increment in the recovery of mature cells at day 10 from the non-leukemic cultures (P = 0.03), while only a minor increase was found in the leukemic cultures (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> liquid cultures exposed to greater than or equal to 10(-9) M Ara-C showed a marked reduction in the immature proliferating cell pool, with a concomitant increase in the percentage of mature non-dividing cells at 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the absolute number of differentiated cells recovered remained constant or decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-leukemic and eight of nine leukemic cultures, compared with cultures without Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhanced recovery of differentiated cells was also never observed in any culture exposed to the relatively non-toxic 10(-9) M Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These in vitro findings support clinical observations suggesting that cytotoxicity rather than differentiation is the major mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of low-dose Ara-C in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
