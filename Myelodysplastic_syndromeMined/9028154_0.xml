<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficiency ratio (R-Ef) was calibrated with V-2, the second canonical discriminant variate which underwent axis rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on discriminated FEK patterns, as previously reported, the patients were classified into five types i.e. I-z, ineffective, H-z, hemolytic hyperplastic, O-z, hypoplastic, I-H-z and I-O-z, combination of these, groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of I-z group was 48% and that of I-H-z and I-O-z groups was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were obtained in I-z group between R-Ef and ETU (r = -0.628), unclear abnormality scores (R = 0.664) or ringed sideroblast scores (R = 0.742), scored by dummy variables regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other groups, significant deviation from these correlations was observed, indicating that there is an obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients concerning association or dissociation of morphological abnormality, in addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of erythroblasts, with or from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
