<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the impact of interindividual variation in enzymes that activate (i.e., CYP2E1) and detoxify (i.e., NQO1) <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites, we carried out a case-control study in Shanghai, China, of occupational <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning (BP; i.e., hematotoxicity), which we show is itself strongly associated with subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and the related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (relative risk, 70.6; 95% confidence interval, 11.4-439.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CYP2E1 and NQO1 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP, and CYP2E1 enzymatic activity was estimated by the fractional excretion of chlorzoxazone (fe(6-OH)) for 50 cases of BP and 50 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with both a rapid fe(6-OH). and two copies of the NQO1 609C--&gt;T mutation had a 7.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.8-31.2) increased risk of BP compared to subjects with a slow fe(6-OH) who carried one or two <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NQO1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI polymorphism did not influence BP risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that provides evidence of human susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of susceptibility for hematotoxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> among workers with a history of occupational exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is warranted </plain></SENT>
