<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report results of a phase II clinical trial in 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) to whom HMBA was administered by continuous infusion for 10 days and repeated after an interval of 18 to 75 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HMBA induced a complete remission (CR) in three patients and a partial remission (PR) in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CR was 6.8 months (range 1.3 to 16 months) and 3.7 months for PR (range 1 to 7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between responders and nonresponders with respect to the mean HMBA plasma levels, which were 0.86 +/- 0.04 mmol/L and 0.87 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In certain patients morphologic and chromosome analyses provided evidence that HMBA induced differentiation of transformed hematopoietic precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prominent toxicity was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, generally reversible on cessation of administration of HMBA </plain></SENT>
