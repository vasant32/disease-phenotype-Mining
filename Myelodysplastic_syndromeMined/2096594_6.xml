<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> between L5 and S was suspected and laminectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At surgery, an easily curretable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> occupied the epidural space from L5 to the end of the sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spread out of the vertebral canal and invaded the surrounding muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This muscle tissue and part of the lamina were checked histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial blood analysis revealed 5% blast-like cells, but failed to confirm them as leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells had round or oval nuclei with large nucleoli and scanty cytoplasm without granulocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> was initially suspected, but the definite diagnosis was uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with the <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> method and enzyme histochemistry revealed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were positive for lysozyme and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> chloracetate esterase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> was finally diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic findings supported this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequent karyotyping of bone marrow cells revealed 8; 21 translocation, thus the final diagnosis of this patient was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blast cells in transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, M2, by the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
