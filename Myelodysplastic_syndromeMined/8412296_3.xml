<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparing 36 patients (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13 RA</z:chebi>/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 13 RAEB, 10 RAEB-t) with 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, significant differences in both the percentage of AS-E1+ cells and the fraction of AS-E1+ cells in the S or S-G2M-phase between the four groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since neither the percentage of AS-E1+ cells nor their fraction in S or S-G2M alone was found to characterize their proliferative activity, we introduced the proliferative fractions of the erythroid cell, i.e. the number of the AS-E1+ cells in S or S-G2M related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow cells in S or S-G2M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Applying these parameters, we found significantly increased proliferative AS-E1 fractions in the RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> group compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p = 0.03 and 0.002) respectively, as well as a highly significant decrease with disease progression </plain></SENT>
