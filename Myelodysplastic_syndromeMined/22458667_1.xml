<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a double-blind interobserver study of 100 different cases of SAA and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> among seven haematopathologists of the European Working Group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Childhood (EWOG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and the German SAA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases with foci of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, such as patchy erythropoiesis with defective maturation, in an otherwise highly hypocellular or adipocytic bone marrow were classified as having <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples without a patchy distribution, few scattered myeloid cells or haematopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> were diagnosed as SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In only four of 100 cases did the reference pathologists not reach agreement regarding classification as SAA or <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kappa index was 0.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the vast majority of SAA and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> cases can be reliably differentiated by morphological means alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clear differentiation between SAA and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> at presentation is mandatory for optimizing therapy strategies, and might be responsible for the fact that, in the German childhood SAA study, the probability of developing clonal disease after immunosuppressive therapy has dropped to 3% </plain></SENT>
