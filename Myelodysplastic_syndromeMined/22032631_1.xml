<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: Abnormal immunophenotypes of haematopoietic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been identified by flow cytometry (FCM) as a typical characteristic of myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients show varying degrees of erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, we analysed the immunophenotypic feature of erythroblasts to evaluate its diagnostic application in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Erythroid antigens CD71 and CD105 expression were analysed using FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development index (DI) acquired by log transformation of the CD71/CD105 expression ratio was used to denote the erythroid maturation and distinguish patients with non-clonal cytopenias from low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic quality of DI in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-clonal cytopenia patients was evaluated using the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under-expression of CD71 and over-expression of CD105 were detected in erythroblasts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with non-clonal cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic test showed good diagnostic power that the area under the ROC curve was greater than 0.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 75.6% and 92.3%, respectively, according to the DI threshold defined by the ROC curve in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the DI showed a positive correlation with the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with lower DI usually showed frequent red cell transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with a lower DI generally had the HLA-DR15 allele or marrow hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Developmental defects and immune-associated factors may contribute to the erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The DI derived from ratios of CD71 and CD105 expression is a useful marker to characterise dyserythropioiesis associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and can be helpful in distinguishing it from dyerythropoiesis associated with non-clonal disorders </plain></SENT>
