<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the positive rate and the &gt; 1-log increase expression frequency of PRAME were similar to those of WT1 (74.4 % vs. 77.6%; 51.6% vs. 49.0%), and 88.1% of patients overexpressed at least one marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequencies of PRAME expression with higher degrees of increase were significantly higher compared with those of WT1 expression (&gt; 2-log increase: 30.8% vs. 3.8%; &gt; 3-log increase: 9.0% vs. 0%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRAME had a higher log increase than WT1 in 53.3% of the patients with overexpressed WT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both PRAME and WT1 transcript levels generally fluctuated within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients in continuous complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six out of seven patients were predicted relapse by the combined detection: sustained positivity, or significant increase to be positive for both WT1 and PRAME in three patients, earlier by PRAME than WT1 or by PRAME alone in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, PRAME and WT1 transcripts constitute a good molecular marker combination for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
