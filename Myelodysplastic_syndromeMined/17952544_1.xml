<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with malignant disease who underwent TBI followed by bone marrow transplantation were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 86 patients (51 males, 35 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 36 patients were treated on twice-daily fractions of 2 Gy for 3 days to a total 12 Gy (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 50 patients were treated on once-daily fractions of 2.4 or 3.0 Gy for 4 or 5 days to a total 12 Gy (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 49.2%, and relapse-free survival was 44.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding overall survival (P = 0.1237) or relapse-free survival (P = 0.1548) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients in group A had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> of grade 3 or higher severity compared with three patients in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients in group A (5-year probability rate was 7.6%) and patients in group B (5-year probability rate was 13.9%) (P = 0.9519) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that our once-daily TBI regimen is feasible and had the benefit of reducing the complexity of TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that further investigation of the TBI regimen is needed </plain></SENT>
