<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002718'>recurrent bacterial infections</z:hpo> as a result of differentiation defects of the myeloid lineage and a disturbed functioning of neutrophilic granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Important physiological activators of neutrophils are the cytokines interleukin-8/CXC chemokine ligand 8 (IL-8/CXCL8), which activates CXC chemokine receptor 1 and 2 (CXCR1 and CXCR2), and growth-related oncogene (GROalpha)/CXCL1, which stimulates only CXCR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that migration toward IL-8/GROalpha gradients is decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) neutrophils compared with healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in IL-8/GROalpha-induced migration and showed that specific inhibitors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) abrogated neutrophil migration toward IL-8/GROalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these results, we subsequently showed that IL-8/GROalpha-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 was substantially diminished in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of the PI-3K downstream target protein kinase B/Akt was disturbed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils when cells were activated with IL-8 but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upon GROalpha stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-8 stimulation resulted in higher migratory behavior and ERK1/2 activation than GROalpha stimulation, suggesting a greater importance of CXCR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then investigated IL-8-induced activation of the small GTPase Rac implicated in ERK1/2-dependent migration and found that it was less efficient in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-8 triggered a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activation of the GTPases Ras and Ral, indicating that the observed defects were not a result of a general disturbance in CXCR1/2 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate a disturbed CXCR1- and CXCR2-induced neutrophil chemotaxis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which might be the consequence of decreased Rac-ERK1/2 and PI-3K activation within these cells </plain></SENT>
