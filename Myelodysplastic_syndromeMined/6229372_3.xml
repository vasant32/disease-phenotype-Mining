<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fractionated bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocyte receptors were assessed by rosette formation with optimally sensitized ox erythrocytes and the results compared with those found in 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrows and with those previously reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fc-IgG and C3b receptor expression was generally increased in maturing granulocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnostic groups but premature expression was particularly marked in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> and refractory cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receptor patterns showed a better correlation with the severity of dysgranulopoiesis than with the morphological types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, changes in membrane receptor expression reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results further indicate considerable immunological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of granulocytes within individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> categories </plain></SENT>
