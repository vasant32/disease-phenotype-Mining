<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 60 years with a male:female ratio of 17:3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>History of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> was noted in 30%, potential exposure to toxic chemicals in 20%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> in 20%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> with marrow hypocellularity and increased marrow blast cells were characteristic hematopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow hypocellularity was moderate to severe (less than or equal to 25%) in over half of the cases and mild to moderate (greater than 25, less than or equal to 35%) in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blast cells were the predominant cellular elements in the marrow displaying scanty to moderate amounts of cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, and one or more nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Special stains were performed in 19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blast cells morphologically displayed myeloid features, but Sudan black B and/or peroxidase positivity was noted in only ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was high, especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 year follow-up, 11 patients had received chemotherapy and eight of these eleven were dead compared to three of nine patients dead in those not receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only two patients developed "overt" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> evidenced by hypercellular marrow and over 30% blast cells in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HBMIB is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by severe marrow failure and a low response rate to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
