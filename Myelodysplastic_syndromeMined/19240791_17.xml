<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior genomic studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis has never been formally tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we designed this study to systematically and comprehensively evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 28 chromosome 5q31.2 genes and directly test whether haploinsufficiency of a single 5q31.2 gene may result from a heterozygous nucleotide mutation or microdeletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (bone marrow) and germline (skin) DNA samples from 46 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (37 without a cytogenetic 5q31.2 deletion) and performed total exonic gene resequencing (479 amplicons) and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no somatic nucleotide changes in the 46 MDS samples, and no cytogenetically silent 5q31.2 deletions in 20/20 samples analyzed by array CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve novel single nucleotide polymorphisms were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of 7 genes in the commonly deleted interval were reduced by 50% in CD34+ cells from del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples, and no gene showed complete loss of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that small deletions and/or point mutations in individual 5q31.2 genes are not common events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and implicate haploinsufficiency of multiple genes as the relevant genetic consequence of this common deletion </plain></SENT>
