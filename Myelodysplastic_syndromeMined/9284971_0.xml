<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MTO-94 cells matured in culture medium without the addition of growth factors, and yielded neutrophils with pseudo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pelger HuÃ«t anomaly</z:e> or hypersegmentation until 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten months after the start of cell cultivation, MTO-94 consisted of myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface phenotypes were as follows: CD7 90.3%, CD13 99.6%, CD33 75.6%, HLA-DR 96.3% and CD34 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was 46, XY i(17q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of MTO-94 cells was enhanced by rhIL-3, G-CSF, rhGM-CSF and rhSCF but not by rhIL-6 and erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTO-94 cells with i(17q) might be useful in the study of biological aspects of not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> with i(17q) as the sole chromosomal anomaly </plain></SENT>
