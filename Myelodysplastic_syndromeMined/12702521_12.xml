<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, data on the occurrence of second solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in this setting are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluates the occurrence of second hematological and solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the context of a prospective multicenter phase III trial comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> at intermediate doses (EC), or at full doses (HEC), with classical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (CMF) in 777 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 73 months, the following 8-year actuarial rates of second solid primaries were observed: CMF 5.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5% to 9.5%], EC 4.1% (95% CI 0.1% to 8.1%), and HEC 7.2% (95% CI 3.2% to 11.2%) (P = 0.79 by log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were reported, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the HEC arm (incidence = 1.2%, 95% CI 0.0% to 2.5%), which by a three arm comparison allows us to conclude that HEC is statistically different (borderline significance) from CMF and EC (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HEC, as delivered in this trial, cannot be recommended in clinical practice because of the lack of superiority over classic CMF and because of the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> observed in this arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based treatment beyond the current standard of four to six cycles is not recommended in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
