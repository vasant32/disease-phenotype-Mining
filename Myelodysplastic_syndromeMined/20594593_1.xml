<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that proper assessment of comorbidities is useful to predict the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results obtained in this highly selected subset of patients cannot be applied to the whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of comorbidities in 418 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients diagnosed at our institute from 1992 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were classified according to WHO criteria and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received only conservative and supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One or more comorbidities were detected in 390 patients (93%) at the time of diagnosis, with a higher incidence in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac diseases</z:e> were the most frequent comorbidities (30%) while <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlated adverse events were the second cause of comorbidity (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We applied 3 comorbidity prognostic scores (CCI, HCT-CI and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI score proposed by Della Porta et al.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to CCI score, 253 patients had a score 0, 111 patients had a score 1 and 54 patients had a score &gt;2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to HCT-CI, 209 patients had a score 0, 105 patients had a score 1 and 106 patients had a score &gt;2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI score, 288 patients had a score 0 and 129 patients had a score &gt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between survival and stratification according to CCI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI scores (p=0.01 and 0.02, respectively), but not according to HCT-CI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of comorbidities as evaluated according to CCI was directly correlated to the development of RBC transfusion-dependency and was associated to a significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> not related to leukemic evolution (HR = 2.12, p â‰¤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversely, higher risk of non-leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not correlate with higher transfusional requirement according to HCT-CI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-CI scores (p = 0.3 and 0.43, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As suggested by Della Porta et al., also in our experience the presence of cardiac, liver, renal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> was found to independently affect the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (p values from &lt;0.01 to 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, assessment of comorbidities at diagnosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may improve the ability of therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
