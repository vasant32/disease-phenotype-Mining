<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of platelet peroxidase and immunocytochemical study using monoclonal antibody for platelet antigen revealed a large number of blasts in the bone marrow to be megakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, this case was thought to be one of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with excess of blasts including megakaryoblastic proliferation showing chromosome changes at 3q26 and 4q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship of the anomaly on the long arm of a chromosome #3, especially at band 3q26, to abnormal megakaryoblastic proliferation is discussed </plain></SENT>
