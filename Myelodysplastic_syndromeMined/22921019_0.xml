In order to understand present-day positions and peculiarities in any field of human endeavor, familiarity with the past is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those of us who study <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or care for patients diagnosed with these troublesome conditions may wonder also how the current state of affairs evolved with respect to our narrow area of focus, and how we know what we think we know now about these still-enigmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, I review a number of developments that collectively represent a brief "history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>." I first highlight a few landmark observations that preceded any concept of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by hundreds of years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twentieth-century case descriptions and series with hypotheses about the etiology and nature of disorders described as "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>", "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>", and with other terminology culminated in the efforts of the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group of morphologists, whose landmark 1976 and 1982 papers provided the first widely-used classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More recent developments in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> field include new mechanistic biological insights, regulatory approval of several somewhat-effective treatments, and improved organizational support and advocacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The history of a disease concept like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as for history in general, provides both inspiration and cautionary tales that can inform present and future work </plain></SENT>
