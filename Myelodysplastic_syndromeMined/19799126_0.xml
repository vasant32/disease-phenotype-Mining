<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty four adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 19 (1-138) months and the median survival (MS) was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2-year prospective survival (PS) was 60% and 5-year PS was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with very low-risk, low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk and very high-risk stratified by WPSS, 2-year PS was 100%, 96%, 81%, 38% and 14%, and 5-year PS was 100%, 83%, 54%, 20% and 0, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among parameters of laboratory routine examination, elevated mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (MCH), neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (N-ALP) index and nucleated RBC <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> negative were good prognostic factors, while reduced Hb, BPC and bone marrow elevated blasts, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> more than 1 lineage, and lymphocyte-like micromegakaryocyte (MEGly) as well as elevated serum LDH were poor prognostic factors in uni-variable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, MCV, MEGly and blast had independent prognostic significance in multi-variable analysis (P = 0.011, 0.013 and 0.016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WPSS was modified by omitting chromosomal karyotype and transfusion dependence and adding MCV and MEGly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk stratified by modified WPSS, 2-year PS was 94%, 68% and 49%, respectively; and 5-year PS was 86%, 53% and 14%, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The modified WPSS worked well for prognostic prediction in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
