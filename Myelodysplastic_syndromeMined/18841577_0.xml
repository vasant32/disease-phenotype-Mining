<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Abnormalities of chromosome 17 were analyzed in 73 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> with CCAs showed by R banding and conventional karyotyping, including 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CCAs were further analyzed by multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 73 myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with CCAs, chromosome 17 was the most frequently involved chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found in 46.5% (34/73) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, including 12 AML, 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> (BC) and 9 MDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was not found in the 9 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of changes were structural rearrangements which were identified in 43.8%(32/73)of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, among them the frequency was 52.4% (11/21), 33.3% (12/36) and 56.3% (9/16) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numerical abnormalities were detected in 15.1% (11/73) cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17, and the frequency was 25.0% (3/12), 38.5% (5/13) and 33.3% (3/9) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosome 17 were found in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 17 were much more frequent than balanced ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 3 groups, 16, 15 and 8 unbalanced translocations were found respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only two kind of balanced translocations including t(15;17) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t(15;17;22) in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> chromosomes were involved except chromosomes 5, 6 and 22 as partner chromosomes, the most common one was chromosome 15 (8.2%), followed by chromosome 2 (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 cases with translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, the other case was <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of chromosome 17 were the most frequently involved chromosomal aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, and structural rearrangements were more common </plain></SENT>
