<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, abnormal bone marrow differentiation and a high risk of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of karyotypic abnormalities in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper we present the hematologic and cytogenetic findings in 99 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three cases had chromosomal abnormalities nor complex karyotypes were associated with the morphologic subsets described by the FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the karyotypic profile is prognostically important, as indicated by the fact that patients with complex karyotype abnormalities have very short survival </plain></SENT>
