<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the therapeutic activity of recombinant erythropoietin (r-EPO) in association with thalidomide in 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), previously treated with r-EPO (n.15, group A) or thalidomide (n.15, group B) as single agents, respectively, without any significant benefit on their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients of group A and three of group B (23.3%) achieved an erythroid response, according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, responders of group A continued with thalidomide alone, those of group B with r-EPO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses were maintained, thus suggesting they were likely due to the second drug adjuncted (thalidomide for group A and r-EPO for group B), rather than to a combined effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support the hypothesis of a synergistic activity for the association of r-EPO and thalidomide on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It seems, instead, that two populations of patients can be identified, according to their sensitivity to r-EPO or, alternatively, to thalidomide </plain></SENT>
