<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) in neutrophils is reduced in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We quantitatively assayed for LAP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> leukocytes by a flow cytometry based method using a monoclonal antibody raised against human bone alkaline phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LAP expression was assayed in blood samples from a group of 46 MDS patients, consisting of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 3 with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of LAP-positive cells was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and also higher in RA than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cause of the elevated LAP expression, we measured the serum concentrations of several cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level was significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and the serum G-CSF concentration clearly correlated with the percentage of LAP-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the LAP activity in RA is higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and G-CSF is thought to be one of the causes stimulating LAP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils </plain></SENT>
