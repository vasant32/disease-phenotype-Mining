<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound is also useful in other congenital and acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of hemostasis</z:e>, reducing the need for blood derivatives with the inherent risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following article presents a pilot study on the safety and efficacy of desmopressin for the treatment or prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases were consecutively recruited from February to June 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were treated with desmopressin for prevention or treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Desmopressin was diluted in 100 mL of isotonic saline and infused for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) was carried out using the Simplate II device, making two standardized incisions on the forearm: the mean between the two incisions was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reduction of BT was observed in three out of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> who were successfully treated for active <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or dental extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients, the effect of desmopressin on BT was not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> or persistent gum oozing was stopped by a single infusion of desmopressin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients, desmopressin infusion had been successfully administered on a different occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Desmopressin could be a safe and immediately effective option for the treatment or prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
