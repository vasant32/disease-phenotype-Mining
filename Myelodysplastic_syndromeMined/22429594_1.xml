<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal abnormality del(20q) is mostly found in various myeloid disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analyses of 14 patients cytogenetically confirmed to carry the del(20q) aberration in their bone marrow demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deletions were interstitial and both the proximal and distal breakpoints varied among individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The centromeric breakpoints were located in the 20q11.21-12 region, and the telomeric breakpoints, in the 20q13.13-13.33 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of the deletion ranged from 11.2 to 27.3 Mb, and the commonly deleted region (CDR) was estimated to be 7.2 Mb in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two commonly retained regions were present, the proximal region adjacent to the centromere (20q11.1-11.21) and a subtelomeric one (20q13.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CDR of our study was more distal than reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in three patients fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that del(20q) cells were detected at a higher frequency in the karyotype analyses than by interphase FISH and aCGH analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the size and breakpoints of del(20q) have been reported to vary among patients, the presence of one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in the CDR has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study will contribute to the identification of candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes on 20q </plain></SENT>
