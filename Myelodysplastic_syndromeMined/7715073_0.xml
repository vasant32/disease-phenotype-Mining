<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 82-year-old female was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> accompanied by basophilia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since cytogenetic abnormalities other than 5q- were also detected, she was considered to be type B of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the FAB classification a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2b, because peripheral blood findings resembled those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interferon was effective, and resulted in disappearance of peripheral blasts, normalization of platelet numbers, and improvement of basophilia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were interferon-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, cytogenetic studies revealed that about 2/3 of metaphases showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty months after diagnosis, myeloid blastic crisis occurred and eventually the patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with interferon in this case might support the usefulness of the drugs for this kind of disease </plain></SENT>
