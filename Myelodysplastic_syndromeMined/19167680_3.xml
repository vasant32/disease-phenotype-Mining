<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review was performed of 156 patients who underwent SCT (114 BM, 42 BSC) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients remain in continuous complete remission: 35 BM recipients and 20 BSC recipients (median follow-up 139 and 89 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimated 7-year event-free survival (EFS), NRM, and risk of relapse (ROR) are 33% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 25%-43%), 42% (CI 33%-51%), and 25% (CI 17%-33%) for the BM cohort and 45% (CI 32%-64%, P= .07), 32% (CI 18%-47%, P= .15), and 23% (CI 11%-37%, P= .79) for the BSC cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed IPSS poor-risk cytogenetics (P&lt; .001), time from diagnosis to SCT (P&lt; .001), FAB subgroup (P= .001), recipients not in complete remission (CR1) at SCT (P= .005), and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) (P= .04) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predictive of an inferior EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FAB subgroup (P= .002), poor-risk karyotype (P= .004), and non-CR1 status also correlated with ROR in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EFS for poor-risk karyotype patients was superior after receiving BSC compared to BM (39% versus 6%, P&lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCT outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML are strongly associated with the IPSS cytogenetic risk group, although the use of BSC in poor-risk karyotype patients may lead to a more favorable long-term EFS </plain></SENT>
