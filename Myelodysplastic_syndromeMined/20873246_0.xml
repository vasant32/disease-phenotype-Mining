<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The efficacy of CsA was evaluated in 52 patients (30 men and 22 women aged 16 to 74 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients were given CsA as first-line therapy; 20 patients took the agent after prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CsA was used in a daily oral dose of 5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its efficacy was evaluated following 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The efficacy of CsA used as first- and second-line therapy was 56 and 55%, respectively; complete remissions were achieved in 19 and 20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) transformed to RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 31% of cases; baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> did to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was significantly associated with bone marrow (BM) blast cell percentage (&lt; 5% or &gt; 5%; p = 0.0009), BM cellularity (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of hematopoiesis or BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>; p = 0.03), focal polyclonal lymphoid infiltration in the BM (p = 0.01) and karyotype anomalies (low, moderate, and high risks; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CsA is the drug of choice in treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including RA, RA with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of hematopoiesis, with nodular polyclonal lymphoid infiltration in the BM, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype or changes corresponding to a low or moderate IPSS risk </plain></SENT>
