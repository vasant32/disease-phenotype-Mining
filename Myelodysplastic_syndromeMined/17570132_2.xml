<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog, is indicated for treatment of patients with deletion-5q <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NZW rabbits were used because of sensitivity to thalidomide's teratogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Range-finding and pulse-dosing studies preceded a full developmental toxicity study in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits (25/group) given lenalidomide (0, 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day) or thalidomide (180 mg/kg/day) by stomach tube on gestation days (GD) 7-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs, body weights, and feed consumption were recorded daily from GD 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On GD 29, standard maternal necropsy, uterine content, and fetal evaluations were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, thalidomide was selectively toxic to development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the pulse-dosing study, lenalidomide did not affect development at 100 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increases in C(max) and AUC(0-24 hr) values for lenalidomide were slightly less than dose-proportional; lenalidomide occurred in the fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, lenalidomide was maternally toxic (<z:mp ids='MP_0008489'>reduced body weight gain</z:mp> and feed consumption; at 20 mg/kg/day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and one abortion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Developmental toxicity at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day included reduced fetal body weights and increased postimplantation losses and fetal variations (morbidity/purple-discolored skin, undeveloped intermediate lung lobe, irregular nasal-frontal suture, and delayed metacarpal ossification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide selectively reduced fetal body weight, increased postimplantation loss and caused characteristic limb and other dysmorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The maternal and developmental NOAELs for lenalidomide are 3 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unlike thalidomide, lenalidomide affected embryo-fetal development only at maternally toxic dosages, confirming that structure-activity relationships may not predict maternal or developmental effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No fetal malformations were attributable to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
