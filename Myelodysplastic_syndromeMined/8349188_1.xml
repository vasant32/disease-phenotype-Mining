<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has recently been demonstrated that erythropoietin increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some recent experiences have suggested a possible role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From April, 1990 to March, 1991, 16 patients (11 males and 5 females, median age 58.5 years) affected by low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to ameliorate Hb levels and reduce transfusional requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received high doses of rHuEPO (400 U/Kg s.c. twice weekly for 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A partial response, defined as a stable increase in Hb levels &gt; 1g/dL and/or a reduction in transfusional need &gt; 50% lasting at least 3 months, was achieved by 5/16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who responded received an additional course of treatment with rHuEPO at an increased dosage (600 U/Kg twice weekly for 3 months), and one of these five showed a progressive rise in Hb level up to normalization, while the other 4 remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated and no adverse reactions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may benefit from rHuEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
