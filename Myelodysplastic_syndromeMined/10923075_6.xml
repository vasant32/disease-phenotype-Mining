<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively examined the maturation of the granulocytic cell lineage in bone marrow specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by flow cytometry using both light scatter and surface marker characteristics, including CD10 and myeloid lineage-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The 7 MDS cases we studied included 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 3 with RA with ringed sideroblasts, 1 with RA with excess of blasts, and 1 unclassified case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 7 patients matched for age and sex who received bone marrow aspirates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> staging (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement or any other hematologic abnormalities) were selected as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of CD10(+) mature granulocytes was significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had less than 50% CD10(+) cells in the granulocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 1 of the 7 control patients had less than 50% CD10(+) cells (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that flow cytometry might be a useful adjunct in the assessment of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies to correlate CD10(+) mature granulocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with other benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> are indicated to confirm our evaluation </plain></SENT>
