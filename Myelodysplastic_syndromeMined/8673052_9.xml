<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three second bone marrow transplants (BMT) were performed between October 1987 and January 1994 for patients with malignant relapse following initial BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For first BMT, twenty-one of 23 (91%) were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For second BMT, a uniform conditioning regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median patient age at second BMT was 32 years, the median time between first BMT and relapse was 22 months, and the median time to second BMT after relapse was 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second BMT marrow source included: autologous marrow (1), unrelated donors (4), new matched sibling donors (5) and same matched sibling donors as the first BMT (13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival and survival rates at 3 years were 38 and 43%, respectively (median follow-up of survivors was 45 and 48 months, respectively), and five patients survive disease-free at 4-6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within 100 days after second BMT; eight had relapsed within 1 year of the first BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (1) second BMT can offer durable long-term survival in certain patients, especially those who relapse late after first transplant; (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is a suitable conditioning regimen for second BMT </plain></SENT>
