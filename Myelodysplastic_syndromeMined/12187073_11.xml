<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regulatory mechanism of endogenous cytokines in circulating platelet counts of thrombocytopenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the serum levels of both thrombopoietic and inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected from 52 patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> along with 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin (IL)-11, IL-6, IL-8 and stem cell factor (SCF) were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Platelet counts in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients during initial diagnosis, chemotherapy and complete remission were 71.2 +/- 11.6, 47.2 +/- 6.1 and 181.4 +/- 26.3 x10(9)/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median value of TPO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients during diagnosis was 150.6 pg/ml and increased significantly during chemotherapy (median: 828 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.05) but then decreased following complete remission (median: 221.4 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05; respectively), and no significant change was noted in the levels of IL-11 and SCF during treatment of patients or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of IL-6 was not detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum samples but was markedly increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients (median level during diagnosis: 6.7 pg/ml; chemotherapy: 25 pg/ml; complete remission: 7 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of IL-8 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was markedly elevated during diagnosis (median: 27.5 pg/ml; range: 0-1,587 pg/ml), but decreased to the level of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls when patients were under chemotherapy or in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The endogenous levels of TPO, IL-6 and IL-8 are elevated in the thrombocytopenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with previous mechanistic studies and suggest that TPO and IL-6 may be active mediators of platelet production </plain></SENT>
