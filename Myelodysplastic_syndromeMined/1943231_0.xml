<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma inhibited the hematopoietic progenitor cell growth from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, IFN-gamma at lower concentrations (10-10(2) U/ml) consistently enhanced the growth of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of IFN-gamma to suspension cultures promoted cellular differentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, as evidenced by persisting cytogenetic changes, Auer-rod containing maturing cells and cytochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although IFN-gamma therapy resulted in partial or minor responses, these findings suggest the potential of IFN-gamma to act as an inducer of differentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
