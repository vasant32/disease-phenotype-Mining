<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Staining distribution and intensity for TGF-beta, PDGF, VEGF, TGF-beta type II receptor, a receptor for PDGF, and receptors for VEGF and bFGF were similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow from 10 MMM patients showed increased TGF-beta type I receptor (TGF-betaRI) expression in small vessel endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patient specimens had bFGF overexpression in megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased microvessel density and decreased concentration of bFGF-staining stromal cells accompanied these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microvascular TGF-betaRI upregulation and bFGF overexpression by megakaryocytes may cause bone marrow microenvironmental changes in MMM patients </plain></SENT>
