<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to its simplicity the Bournemouth scoring system seems to have achieved wide acceptance for establishing the prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to examine the Bournemouth system in a series of 370 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to evaluate the capability of the prognostic index recently proposed by our group to better define the outcome predicted by the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Bournemouth scoring system identified 3 risk groups, A (0-1 points), B (2-3 points) and C (4 points), in the whole series (p less than 0.0001) and it allowed us to stratify <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) patients into two distinct prognostic groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This scoring system did not show a significant value in RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) patients (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our prognostic index clearly segregated patients in the whole series into low- (0-1 points), intermediate- (2-3 points) and high-risk (4-5 points) groups (p less than 0.00001) as well as stratifying ARSA (p = 0.0005), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (p less than 0.0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t patients (p less than 0.00001) into different prognostic subset, although it failed to demonstrate a significant predictive value in RA patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
