<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the age-adjusted CD4:CD8 ratio in 76 MDS patients compared with 54 healthy controls showed that inadequate CD4+, rather than expansion of CD8+ T cells, was associated with a lower ratio in a group that included both lower and higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In younger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, naive and memory phenotypes defined by CD45RA and CD62L display showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, suggesting a possible relationship to IST responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the correlation between T-cell subset distribution, T-cell turnover and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, a cohort of 20 patients were studied before and after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD4:CD8 ratio correlated inversely with the proliferative T-cell index before treatment in IST-responsive patients, suggesting that proliferation may be linked to accelerated CD4+ T-cell turnover and hematopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show seminal findings that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets are dysregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association between these T-cell defects and response to IST suggests that aberrant T-cell homeostasis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation are critical determinants influencing autoimmune hematopoietic suppression in younger patients </plain></SENT>
