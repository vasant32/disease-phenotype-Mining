<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding isoenzymes M1 and T1 have "null" alleles, which are polymorphic in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to examine whether the GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygous null genotypes have an impact on the response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEpo) treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed lymphocyte DNA samples from 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were scheduled to receive rHuEpo in doses of 150 u/Kg/day for a period of 12 weeks in order to obtain and maintain stable responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to genotype both GSTM1 and GSTT1 simultaneously, in responders and non-responders to rhuEpo with respect to various pretreatment parameters: <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, white blood cell count, platelets, serum erythropoietin, transfusion requirements and bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data obtained were evaluated by chi2 test and odds ratio were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of 27 evaluated patients demonstrated an erythroid response (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine out of the 12 patients (75%) responding after 12 weeks of treatment had GSTM1 null genotype (OR=3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 1 responder (8.3%) was homozygotes of GSTT1 null genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no statistically significant difference in the response rate of the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a treatment with rHuEpo may be effective in achieving a stable erythroid response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who carry an homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 gene </plain></SENT>
