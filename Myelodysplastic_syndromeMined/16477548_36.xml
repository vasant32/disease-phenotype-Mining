<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Micafungin is a newly approved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> in the echinocandin class that is active against Candida species and Aspergillus species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this agent has limited activity against a number of fungi, including Trichosporon species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe 4 patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343941" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated trichosporonosis</z:e> during the use of micafungin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trichosporonosis</z:e> had been seen in the 2 years prior to January 2003, when micafungin became available in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed microbiological records of patients at Kameda General Hospital (Kamogawa City, Chiba, Japan) from 1 January 2002 to 31 July 2005, and identified 4 patients whose blood culture results were positive for Trichosporon species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since January 2003, four patients--3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>--developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343941" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated trichosporonosis</z:e> while receiving treatment with micafungin with or without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon beigelii, and the later 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon asahii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients received micafungin, and 2 also received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimal inhibitory concentrations of micafungin were &gt;16 microg/mL for the 2 isolates available for susceptibility testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with hematologic recovery (neutrophils &gt;500 cells/mm3) showed elimination of the fungus after receiving treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the 3 other patients without hematologic or immunological recovery died of disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trichosporonosis</z:e> in our hospital and its emergence after the introduction of micafungin therapy support the idea that micafungin may exert a significant, selective pressure toward resistant fungi, such as Trichosporon species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, care should be taken regarding the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trichosporonosis</z:e> in patients receiving micafungin with or without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
