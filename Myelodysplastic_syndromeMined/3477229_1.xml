<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutations of N-ras genes were observed to occur randomly among the subtypes of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, whereas the N-ras mutations at codon 12 are more likely to occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> than other mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutations at codon 13 of the N-ras gene were not detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> although they were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> that is considered to be a preleukemic state </plain></SENT>
