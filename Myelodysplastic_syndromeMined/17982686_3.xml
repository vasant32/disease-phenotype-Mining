<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, details of the mechanism of the antitumor effects of MK4 remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of MK4 on cholangiocellular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) cell lines and its mechanism of action using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line that exerts MK4-induced cell growth inhibition via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction and cell cycle arrest as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK4 exerted dose-dependent antitumor effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred in a smaller percentage of cells and there was less cell cycle arrest compared with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines studied previously, which suggested slight MK4-induced cell growth inhibition via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction and cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, histopathological fidings showed a large number of cells containing vacuoles in their cytoplasm, and electron microscopic findings showed a large number of cytoplasmic autophagosomes and autolysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested evidence of autophagy-related cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> staining revealed an increase in the number of cytoplasmic acidic vesicular organelles characteristic of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were few cells forming autophagic vesicles in the control group, while the percentage of cells containing vacuoles in the MK4-treated group increased with the duration of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that, unlike in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, the antitumor effects of MK4 on <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> cells are induced via autophagy formation </plain></SENT>
