<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in a population served by one district general hospital over a 10-year period (1981-90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases were sought through investigation of individuals presenting with suggestive peripheral blood findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>279 new cases were diagnosed in a population rising from 203,000 to 226,000 over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed incidence rate did not change over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate was 12.6/100,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-specific incidence rates per 100,000 per year were 0.5 for age &lt; 50, 5.3 for age 50-59, 15 for age 60-69, 49 for age 70-79, and 89 for age 80+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cohort study of one large general practice revealed several previously unknown and asymptomatic cases, indicating that the observed figures for the population overall may still underestimate the real incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is more common than reported in previous studies and that incidence continues to rise into very old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Difficulties in case ascertainment hamper reliable estimates of true incidence </plain></SENT>
