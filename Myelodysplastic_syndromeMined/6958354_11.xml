<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group consists of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL), and three patients with acquired idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (AISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had a prior history of therapeutic or occupational exposure to potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi>, G(TG)-banding revealed clonal abnormalities in nine of the 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients exhibited one or more of the following cytogenetic abnormalities: 5q deletion, -7, +8, or +21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AISA group appeared to be unique as chromosome abnormalities were seen in two of the three patients and the clinical course in these patients had been prolonged without progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other clinical correlation could be made in the blast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and CMMoL groups, except for possible survival benefit in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
