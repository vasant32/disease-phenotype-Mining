<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that IgM and IgG WT1 antibodies were detected with significantly higher detection rate and antibody titers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to those in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, whether IgG humoral immune responses against WT1 protein were Th1- or Th2-type were determined by measurement of four subclasses of IgG WT1 antibody, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results showed that Th1-biased humoral immune responses against WT1 protein were generated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results should allow us to consider that Th1-biased cellular immune responses against WT1 protein, which was essentially needed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy targeting WT1, should be elicited in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
