<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 25 recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> have been identified, involving biologic pathways as diverse as chromatin remodeling and pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several of these mutations have been shown to have prognostic implications that are independent of existing risk stratification systems based on clinical and pathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of these recent discoveries to diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification, and treatment selection for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has the potential to improve patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we review recent advances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and discuss potential applications of these discoveries to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
