<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) undergoing induction chemotherapy has yet to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective historical control study evaluated the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> complex (ABLC) in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were undergoing induction chemotherapy received prophylactic ABLC 2.5 mg/kg intravenously 3 times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This treatment group was compared with a historical control group that had similar baseline characteristics and received prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> (L-AmB) 3 mg/kg 3 times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the incidence of documented or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> during and up to 4 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reported adverse events were used to assess tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis was similar in patients who received ABLC and patients who received L-AmB (P=0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 131 ABLC-treated patients and 70 L-AmB-treated patients who were assessed for efficacy and safety, 49% of patients in each group completed therapy without developing a documented or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> occurred in 5% of ABLC-treated patients and in 4% of L-AmB-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternative antifungal strategies were required because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> of unknown pathogen in 28% and 32% of ABLC-treated and L-AmB-treated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, therapy discontinuations due to adverse events, and survival rates also were similar between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ABLC and L-AmB appeared to have similar efficacy and were tolerated well as antifungal prophylaxis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were undergoing induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
