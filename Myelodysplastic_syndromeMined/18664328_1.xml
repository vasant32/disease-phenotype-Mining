<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>)-derived MUTZ-1 cell line was used to examine the effects of a human urine preparation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>-2, on the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic proteins, including caspase family, Bcl-2 family, the inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (IAP) family, and the FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), as well as cell cycle-associated proteins were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival signaling pathway and the NF-kappaB pathway were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk was used to examine the involvement of caspase-3 and poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to examine the involvement of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing effect </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>-2 could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of MUTZ-1 cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main mechanisms were related to the inhibition of PI3Kp110alpha expression at the transcriptional level, which inactivated the phosphorylation of Akt involving the prevention NF-kappaB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, the downregulation of the IAP family and FLIPL protein, and the dephosphorylation of the Bad protein, which then triggered the activation of the caspase cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon could be inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the presence of active components in the human urine extract that can induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-derived MUTZ-1 cells and may involve the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a caspase-3-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may provide new insights for the treatment of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
