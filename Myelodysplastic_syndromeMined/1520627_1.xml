<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-associated inhibitory activity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-IA), which inhibited colony formation in vitro of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When adherent marrow cells were incubated with fetal calf serum for 21-24 d, monocyte-derived <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> containing huge macrophages (MDLM) developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MDLM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MDLMs) and their conditioned medium (MDLM-CM) consistently suppressed the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-IA was active on CFU-GM during the S-phase and relatively resistant to heating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibody against H subunit (acidic) ferritin and polyclonal antibody against placental ferritin neutralized the inhibitory activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MDLMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, cell lysates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MDLMs reacted to both monoclonal anti-H subunit ferritin and polyclonal anti-placental ferritin in Western blotting analysis, indicating that the inhibitory activity was predominantly acidic isoferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, MDLMs obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow had a CFU-GM enhancing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MDLMs may be responsible for the suppression of granulopoiesis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that the suppression may be mediated by soluble factors, notably H subunit isoferritin </plain></SENT>
