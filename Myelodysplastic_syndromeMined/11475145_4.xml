<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of immune phenomena associated with antibody production have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that red cell antibodies are more frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to other regularly transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Red cell antibodies were determined in 42 MDS patients, in 28 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, and in a historical group of 129 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients received frequent red cell substitution therapy, at least two RBCU in biweekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Red cell antibodies were detected in 9 of 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in 3 of 28 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, and in 4 of 129 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of red cell antibodies was displayed by 6 of 27 MDS patients treated with prestorage leukocyte-depleted RBCU and 3 of 15 MDS patients transfused with bedside leukocyte-filtered RBCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Red cell antibodies are frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> who require repetitive red cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The formation of alloantibodies to red cell antigens is as frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as in other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
