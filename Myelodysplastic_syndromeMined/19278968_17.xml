<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After successful treatment of malignant diseases, therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> have emerged as significant problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate outcome and risk factors in patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1981 and 2006, 461 patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid, a median age of 40 years and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> (n=163), malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=133), or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> (n=57) underwent stem cell transplantation and their data were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse at 3 years was 37% and 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis significant factors for relapse were not being in complete remission at the time of transplantation (p=0.002), abnormal cytogenetics (p=0.005), higher patients' age (p=0.03) and therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (p=0.04), while higher non-relapse mortality was influenced by higher patients' age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a marked reduction in non-relapse mortality per calendar year during the study period (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 33% and 35%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis significant higher overall survival rates were seen per calendar year (p&lt;0.001), for younger age (&lt;40 years) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using age (&lt;40 years), abnormal cytogenetics and not being in complete remission at the time of transplantation as risk factors, three different risk groups with overall survival rates of 62%, 33% and 24% could be easily distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cure patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and has markedly improved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Non-complete remission, abnormal cytogenetics and higher patients' age are the most significant factors predicting survival </plain></SENT>
