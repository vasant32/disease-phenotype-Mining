<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> experiencing t (1;7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients seen in our hospital from 1992 to 2001 were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes were prepared using the direct method as well as 24-hour unstimulated cultures of fresh heparinized bone marrow for each subject, while R-banding was used to analyze karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using SpectrumRed and SpectrumGreen directly labeled chromosome 1-specific alpha-satellite DNA probe (red) and chromosome 7- specific alpha-satellite DNA probe (green) was performed for three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the five patients, three had 1;7 translocation due to a long history of exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three cases, dual-color FISH resulted in three red signals and two green ones, in which one red signal adjoining one green signal in 27.6%, 84% and 18.5% metaphases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> may be the cause for Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with t (1;7) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result of dual-color FISH convincingly confirmed that the centromere of the derivative chromosome 7p/1q resulting from 1;7 translocation was made up of centromeres from both chromosomes 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
