<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the biologic activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> (13-CRA) in patients with myelodysplastic states (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we administered 13-CRA orally (2.5 mg/kg/d initially, escalated to 4 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks to 15 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of 15 patients (53%) experienced an increase in peripheral granulocyte counts of greater than 20% (range, 22% to 700%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five patients, the absolute increase in peripheral granulocyte count was greater than 500 cells/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of 15 patients experienced a decrease in the circulating granulocyte count of greater than or equal to 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparable values for peripheral platelet counts were 27% (4/15 patients) greater than 20% increase and 33% (5/15 patients) greater than 20% decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced a major change in erythrocyte transfusion requirement while receiving 13-CRA in comparison with pretreatment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had morphologic and cytogenetic evaluation of marrow cells before 13-CRA treatment, and with one exception, marrow morphologic and cytogenetic abnormalities persisted following 13-CRA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exception occurred in the patient with the most dramatic response, whose granulocyte count increased from 400 to 2,800 cells/microL along with a normalization of the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score, a morphologic improvement in granulocyte maturation, and a disappearance of the initial chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes did not persist after cessation of 13-CRA administration, but were reproduced following drug readministration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients experienced serious decrements in peripheral blood counts or leukemic transformation while receiving 13-CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had mild to marked dermatologic toxicity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cheilosis</z:e>, skin dryness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other major toxicity was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 13-CRA may be safely administered and may increase peripheral granulocyte counts in a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
