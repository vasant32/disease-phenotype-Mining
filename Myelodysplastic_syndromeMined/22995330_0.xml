<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current World Health Organization classification considers <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with isolated del(5q) a distinct entity owing to its characteristic clinical and pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, several studies have examined survival, leukemic transformation, and various prognostic factors in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is a lack of detailed comparative pathologic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases in which del(5q) is present in association with additional cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 26 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> at initial diagnosis with 5q- alone, 5q- plus 1 additional abnormality, and 5q- as part of a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of 17 patients had evidence of JAK2 V617F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with isolated 5q-, patients with additional abnormalities had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean corpuscular volume and decreased platelet counts (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on bone marrow examination, they were significantly more likely to have increased cellularity, trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, lower proportion of small hypolobated megakaryocytes, higher number of blasts, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of these morphologic features can be used to distinguish these more aggressive cases from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with isolated 5q- and a more benign clinical course </plain></SENT>
