<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proinflammatory agents such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can prime ROS production in response to chemoattractants such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In neutrophils from patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a clonal, hematological disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002718'>recurrent bacterial infections</z:hpo>, this GM-CSF priming is severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we set out to further delineate the defects in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of GM-CSF priming on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-triggered activation of Rac, a small GTPase implicated in neutrophil ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to healthy neutrophils, activation of Rac in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> was not enhanced by GM-CSF pretreatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of Rac was attenuated by pretreatment of neutrophils with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike healthy neutrophils, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced accumulation of the PI-3K <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> product PI(3,4,5)trisphosphate was not increased by GM-CSF pretreatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disturbed Rac and PI-3K activation observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils did not appear to reflect a general GM-CSF or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> receptor-signaling defect, as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-triggered Ras activation could be primed by GM-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and healthy neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced activation of the GTPase Ral was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, a defect in priming of the PI-3K-Rac signaling pathway, located at the level of PI-3K, results in a decreased GM-CSF priming of ROS production </plain></SENT>
