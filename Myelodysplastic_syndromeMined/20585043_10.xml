<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L3MBTL1 is expressed within hematopoietic CD34(+) cells; thus, it may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define its role in hematopoiesis, we knocked down L3MBTL1 expression in primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor (ie, CD34(+)) cells isolated from human cord blood (using short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>) and observed an enhanced commitment to and acceleration of erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this effect, overexpression of L3MBTL1 in primary hematopoietic CD34(+) cells as well as in 20q- cell lines restricted erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, L3MBTL1 levels decrease during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-induced erythroid differentiation or erythropoietin exposure, suggesting a specific role for L3MBTL1 down-regulation in enforcing cell fate decisions toward the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, L3MBTL1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to erythropoietin (Epo), with increased Epo-induced phosphorylation of STAT5, AKT, and MAPK as well as detectable phosphorylation in the absence of Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that haploinsufficiency of L3MBTL1 contributes to some (20q-) myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, by promoting erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
