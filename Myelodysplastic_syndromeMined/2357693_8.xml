<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the unrelated clones may have been derived from the common leukemic clone without microscopic chromosome changes, and that the different chromosome abnormalities of the unrelated clones may represent additional genetic changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
