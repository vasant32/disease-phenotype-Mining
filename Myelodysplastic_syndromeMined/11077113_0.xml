<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This allows for the determination of the dynamic cell kinetic parameters: LI, T(s), and T(pot) and we observed that in vitro HGF stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in mean T(pot) values from 6.6 to 3.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we demonstrated that in vivo GM-CSF administration to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> resulted in a shortening of T(pot) within the 2 first weeks of GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
