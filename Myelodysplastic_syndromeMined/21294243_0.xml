<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently, it is widely accepted that one of the crucial players in adult leukemic transformation is the RUNX1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little data available regarding whether mutations in this gene also contribute to pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, especially in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we made a decision to screen patients with pediatric myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> for the presence of RUNX1 mutations in their samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Patients (n = 238) with diagnoses of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 198), de novo myelodisplastic syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (n = 16), therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 9), juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>) (n = 15) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were Belarusians between the ages of 0 and 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of RUNX1 point mutations in the total group of patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 3% and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cooperation of point mutations in the RUNX1 and NRAS genes, and the cytogenetic abnormality, -7/7q-, was demonstrated in children with therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RUNX1 point mutations predominate in those de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency of RUNX1 point mutations was about 4% in a group of children with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> aged 0-14 years diagnosed during the period of 1998-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During the course of this investigation, valuable data were obtained concerning RUNX1 gene mutation frequencies in different clinical, morphological, and cytogenetic groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, and its cooperation with other molecular aberrations </plain></SENT>
