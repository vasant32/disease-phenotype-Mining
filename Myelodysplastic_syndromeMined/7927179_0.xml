<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 gene alterations did not always cluster within evolutionarily highly conserved regions, and there were various base change forms in cases with p53 point mutations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, simultaneous mutations in both the genes were detected in only 2 cases out of 23, thereby indicating infrequent occurrence of concomitant mutation of both the genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
