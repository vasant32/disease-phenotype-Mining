<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was determined according to Feinendegen's classification, which is considered to reflect megakaryocytic maturation, and the ploidy was determined by microcytofluorometry, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>) staining after the removal of Wright-Giemsa stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most micromegakaryocytes (i.e., megakaryocytes &lt; 20 microns in diameter) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were morphologically mature, as were those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peak micromegakaryocytic ploidy was 4N or 8N, whereas that of the megakaryocytes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36936">16N</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that the micromegakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were morphologically mature but had impaired polyploidization </plain></SENT>
