<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The growing numbers of survivors of innovative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatments, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), often report subsequent cognitive difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare neurocognitive changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) after allogeneic HSCT or other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, serial evaluations of attention, concentration, memory, mood, and quality of life were used in a consecutive sample of 106 eligible patients who had <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n = 91) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 15) at enrollment and then 12 months and 18 months after HSCT or other therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3 evaluations at enrollment, 12 months, and 18 months were completed by 98%, 95%, and 89% of surviving participants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, there was significant improvement in memory over 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, the 45 patients who underwent HSCT (42 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) compared favorably with the patients who received other treatment on most measures of neuropsychological function, except they had improved mental health (P = .034), worse physical function (P = .049), and more difficulty with coordination and fine motor speed bilaterally (dominant hand, P = .005; nondominant hand, P = .0019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> overall had improved phonemic fluency (P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that time and diagnosis may be important factors when assessing neurocognitive and other changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complaints regarding "chemobrain" after HSCT merit further study, because deficits actually may predate the initiation of treatment and subsequently may improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study results could reassure prospective HSCT recipients, because HSCT compared favorably with other treatments when mental status side effects were considered </plain></SENT>
