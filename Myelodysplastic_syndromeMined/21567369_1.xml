<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The improving prognosis of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> has partially been attributed to the increasing importance of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze whether outcome of these patients on a PICU improved during the last decade and which factors may influence the outcome in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients admitted to the PICU between 1998 and 2009 have been reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients admitted for life threatening complications has been correlated with basic data, organ failure and the PRISM score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of 2 consecutive treatment periods (1998-2003 and 2004-2009) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 644 admissions of 226 patients were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>79 admissions were performed because of potentially life threatening complications (Group A), 236 for monitoring (B) and 329 admissions for interventions (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>62% of Group A patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Group B and C patients were discharged alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was associated with admission &gt;28 days after initial diagnosis, PRISM &gt;10, organ failure &gt;2 organs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, need for mechanical ventilation or for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PICU survival rate of Group A patients admitted between 2004 and 2009 (78%) was higher than in the period between 1998 and 2003 (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PICU provides essential services to support the pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> may have had benefit from advances in pediatric intensive care over the past decade, specific scoring systems for early identification of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> needing PICU treatment are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These systems might further improve PICU outcome in critical ill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
