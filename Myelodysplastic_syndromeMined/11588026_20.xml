<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with a histocompatible sibling were candidates for alloSCT and the remaining patients for ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remission-induction therapy consisted of 1 or 2 courses with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, followed by one intensive consolidation course with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, bone marrow cells were used for ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, mobilized blood stem cells were used in an attempt to shorten posttransplantation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 3.6 years the 184 evaluable patients showed a 4-year survival rate of 26% and a median survival of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remission-induction chemotherapy induced complete remission (CR) in 100 patients (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 29% and the median DFS was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of 39 patients (72%) with a donor were allografted in CR-1, including 2 patients who underwent transplantation in CR-1 without a consolidation course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six of 59 patients (61%) without a donor received ASCT in CR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4-year DFS rates in the group of patients with or without a donor were 31% and 27%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 4-year survival rates from CR were 36% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This large prospective study shows the feasibility of both alloSCT and ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This treatment approach leads to a relatively high remission rate, and the majority of patients in remission received the SCT in CR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ongoing study investigates whether this approach is better than treatment with chemotherapy only </plain></SENT>
