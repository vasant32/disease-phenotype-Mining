<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes were found: refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), 58 cases; sideroblastic refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (SRA), 42 cases; refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 46 cases; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), 39 cases; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following scoring systems were applied: Mufti's 1985, Varela's 1985, Sanz's 1989 and our own of 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was performed according to Kaplan-Meier actuarial system and the log-Rank test of actuarial survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Three groups (A, B and C) can be defined by the Bournemouth system, with median survivals of 57.6, 17 and 7.6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases (118) were included in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A has not reached 25% of actuarial survival probability, whereas groups B and C did at 32 and 10 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to the morphologic subtypes, RA and SRA were included in groups A and B, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> pertained mostly of group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty cases (90.9%) evolving into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (AL) corresponded to those last groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) The three groups defined by Varela's system (0-1, 2-5 and 6 or more) have median survival of 85.6, 24 and 14 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Like in the former system, group 0-1 has not reached 25% actuarial probability, this appearing at 70 and 20 months, respectively, in groups 2-5 and greater than 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the cytological varieties, RA and SRA amongst the groups is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> although there are more common within the cases included in groups 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases evolving into AL were included in the groups 2-5 and greater than 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) The 3 groups of the system proposed by Sanz (0-1, 2-3 and 4-5) had median survival of, respectively, 58, 15 and 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Like in the preceding cases, group 0-1 has not reached the 25% actuarial probability, while this figure appears at 28 months for group 2-3 and at 20 months for group 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RA and SRA varieties are included chiefly in group 0-1, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> appear mostly in groups 2-3 and 4-5 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(4) The prognostic groups are defined by the system proposed by us (namely 0-2, 3-5, 5 greater than or equal to 6) with median survivals of 89.3, 17 and greater than 11 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Striking difference was seen when studying the cumulated survivals observed, on each of the three percentages considered, between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The different cytological varieties distributed reasonably with higher incidence of RA and SRA in group I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This system offers statistical significance when comparing RA with SRA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and, obviously </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The evolution into AL showed also statistical significance with respect to the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Three prognostic groups regarding the patient's survival could be established in our series with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the scoring systems analyzed, except that of Sanz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Low risk (RA and SRA) and high risk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) cytological varieties can be identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the scoring systems; that of Sanz is also capable of discriminating RA from SRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Some prediction on the possibility of evolution into AL can be attained of with each system </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The scoring system proposed by us shows higher discriminating capability on the cytologic varieties as well as higher predictive value on the possibility of evolution into AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it must be evaluated in other series in order to reach general acceptance </plain></SENT>
