<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dual-color XY, major Bcr-Abl (M-Bcr-Abl), and specific alpha-satellite probes were used for sex-mismatched HCT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases with karyotypic abnormalities before HCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Donor cells were found using FISH analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 cases examined within 2 months following HCT, confirming engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six cases, however, cytogenetic analysis failed to detect donor cells due to lack of metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in four of the six cases in which mixed chimerism was detected using FISH analysis after 6 months of HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after 12 months of HCT, no relapse was found in 24 patients without host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For two patients with mixed chimerism, gradual reduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> or donor lymphocyte infusion resulted in the disappearance of host cells as analyzed using FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three extramedullary relapse cases, however, cytogenetic relapse preceded morphological and FISH relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that FISH analysis is more useful for detecting residual host cells after HCT, and the combination of FISH and cytogenetic analyses provide a more detailed evaluation for HCT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also indicate that monitoring of mixed chimerism using FISH analysis after 6 months of HCT is important for allowing the early detection of hematological relapse </plain></SENT>
