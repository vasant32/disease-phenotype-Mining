<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The International Prognostic Staging System (IPSS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was developed predominately in patients of European ancestry and is not validated in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a recently revised IPSS (IPSS-R), several new prognostic variables are included, i.e. age, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance score (ECOG PS), serum ferritin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chinese with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> offer a unique opportunity to distinguish the prognostic impacts of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HGB) concentration, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and serum ferritin because in China, patients rarely receive RBC transfusions unless the HGB concentration is &lt;6.0 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: We studied prognostic variables in 191 untreated Chinese primary patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> intermediate-1 (INT-1) in the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Serum ferritin level ≥500 µg/l at diagnosis was a strong independent predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although baseline serum ferritin level was inversely correlated with baseline HGB, it was the serum ferritin, not the baseline HGB level, that was significantly correlated with survival in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new prognostic scoring system including the ECOG PS, absolute neutrophil level, serum ferritin, percentage of bone marrow blasts and poor karyotype was developed for Chinese with IPSS INT-1 MDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: This revised scoring system identified a subgroup of Chinese with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and INT-1 IPPS who have a poor prognosis and may benefit from more intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
