<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Mutations in ras oncogenes occur at high frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>; however, the role of ras genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that expression of mutant N-ras (N-rasG13R, G to C transversion) in human hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) promotes myeloid differentiation and proliferation both in vitro and in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we performed expression profiling to identify the transcriptome induced by N-rasG13R in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>, and analyzed the effect of mutant N-ras in sorted specific subpopulations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: cDNA microarray analysis was performed on cord blood CD34(+) cells transduced with a retrovirus containing GFP alone or in combination with mutant N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transduced cells were also sorted into factorial subpopulations according to CD34 and transgene expression, and analyzed in suspension or semi-solid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a variety of changes, including upregulation of cytokine genes, we found that N-rasG13R induced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis by RT-PCR revealed that increased p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) occurred in the most primitive, CD34(+)/Ras(+) population but not in the more mature CD34(-)/Ras(+) cells or in the CD34(+)/Ras(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, N-rasG13R inhibited the proliferation of the primitive CD34(+)/Ras(+) cells, both in liquid culture and in colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This growth suppression correlated with an increased proportion of myelomonocytic colonies and a decrease of erythroid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the growth of CD34(-)/Ras(+) cells and CD34(+)/Ras(-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> was not inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated the mutant N-ras induced transcriptome, and that this is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> growth suppression/myelomonocytic differentiation, and identify upregulation of cyclin inhibitors as key events in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that ras mutation alone is not sufficient to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>; collaborative secondary event(s) are involved in the process </plain></SENT>
