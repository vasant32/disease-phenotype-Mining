<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a previously published patient cohort treated with ESAs, we selected 112 patients with de novo low or int-1 IPSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with Hb&lt;10 g/dl, serum EPO&lt;500 UI/l and who had never been transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid response rate at 12 weeks was 63.1% (IWG 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, an interval between diagnosis and ESA <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>&lt;6 months, Hb level&gt;9 g/dl, and serum EPO&lt;100 UI/l predicted better response to ESA while shorter interval between diagnosis and ESA <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p=0.01), lower serum EPO (p=0.04) and WHO diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RCMD-RS</z:e> (p=0.03) were associated with longer response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median interval from diagnosis to transfusion dependency was 80 months and 35 months, respectively, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ESA &lt; 6 months and â‰¥ 6 months from diagnosis (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those results support early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ESA in lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, to better avoid the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early introduction of ESA may also delay the need for RBC transfusions, hypothetically by slowing the disease course, but prospective studies are required to further assess this point </plain></SENT>
