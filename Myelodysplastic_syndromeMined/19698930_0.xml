<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite monoclonality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the marrow picture is complicated by the presence of not only stromal cells but also by varying stages of differentiating diseased cells belonging to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now that reproducible results can be obtained from nanograms of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, it is possible to derive useful information from even a limited number of cells; for example, dysregulation of ribosomal and translational genes was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to controls using a small number of CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These biologic and clinical insights are providing the framework on which to build a new model of these diseases which, despite their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, manifest certain unifying themes </plain></SENT>
