<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA index (DI) determined by flow cytometry and karyotype determined by conventional methods were obtained on bone marrow samples from 43 haematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 54 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patients had a clonal karyotype abnormality but an additional five had a DI outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, showing evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> that was not available from chromsome preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When patients were grouped into those with excess chromosomal material, those with diploid karyotypes, and those with a loss of chromosomal material, there was a significant difference among the mean DIs of each group, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects being different from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients DI measurements were of value when carried out together with conventional chromsomal analysis in gaining the maximum amount of genetic information when a satisfactory karyotype might not be available or where failure of an abnormal cell population to proliferate might give an incomplete cytogenetic picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contribution of non-clonal chromsome loss to the DI is probably significant but has not been quantitated </plain></SENT>
