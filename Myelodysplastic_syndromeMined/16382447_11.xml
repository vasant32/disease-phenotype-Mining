<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, we have confirmed our previous hypothesis that the SS mutation itself implies a mutator effect that is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> through these specific chromosome anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This conclusion supports the practice of including cytogenetic monitoring in the follow-up of SS patients </plain></SENT>
