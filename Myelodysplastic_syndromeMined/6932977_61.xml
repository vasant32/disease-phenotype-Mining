<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found necessary to add one category (MO) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and to define more precise quantitative criteria for the categories M1-M6 based on bone marrow differential counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this modified FAB classification, agreement between the two observer groups based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone was 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical stains were essential in establishing the diagnosis in 9%, led to a change of diagnosis by one observer team in 14%, and helped to confirm the diagnosis in 32% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete remission rates, remission duration, and survival were not significantly different among diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: M6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>; CR rate 48%) and ANLL without differentiation (M0, M1, M5a; CR rate 50%) appeared to do less well than ANLL with partial differentiation (M2, M3, M4, M5b; CR rate 59%) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three protocols studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Auer rods were present in 53% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with 63% in the myeloid categories (M1-M4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Auer rods were found to be the single most important prognostic parameter in this study, with a complete remission (CR) rate of 68% in the Auer-rod-positive and of 40% in the Auer-rod-negative group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly longer for patients exhibiting Auer rods (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival for the total group was 13.5 mo and median remission duration for responders was 11.5 mo in the Auer-rod-positive group compared to 6.2 mo median survival and 9.2 mo median remission duration for the Auer-rod-negative group </plain></SENT>
