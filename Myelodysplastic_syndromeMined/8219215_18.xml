<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently IRF1, a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, has been shown to be deleted from the 5q- chromosome in a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the loss of IRF1 may be critical to the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the allelic loss of IRF1 in a group of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a 5q deletion and 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and a 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene dosage experiments demonstrated that 12 of 14 patients had loss of one allele of the IRF1 gene but no evidence of homozygous loss and that 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> retained both copies of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The retention of IRF1 on the 5q- chromosome in these two cases has been confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization localization using an IRF1 cosmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to determine whether there was any evidence for structural rearrangement in the region encompassing the IRF1 gene in these two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No aberrant bands were detected with a range of rare cutter enzyme digests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IRF1 maps outside the commonly deleted segment of the 5q- chromosome and that loss of IRF1 is not solely responsible for the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
