<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A morphometric analysis of bone marrow trephine biopsies has been performed to study the frequency and planimetric characteristics of so-called atypical micromegakaryocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, an attempt was made to discriminate this particular cell population from small immature elements of megakaryocytopoiesis, such as promegakaryoblasts and megakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staining reactions employed included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>), alpha-naphthyl <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> esterase (ANAE) and immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIIa (Y2/51-CD61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the various staining reactions applied to the different megakaryocytic elements together with morphometric measurements resulted in a clearcut identification of promegakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were defined as the earliest immature and exclusively CD61-positive precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atypical micromegakaryocytes were characterized by their dysplastic features and strong ANAE reactivity in addition to their positive CD61 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stringent diagnostic criteria (diameter ranging between 10 to 15 microns, mean size about 12 microns) were applied, this abnormal cell population comprised less than 10% of total megakaryocytopoiesis in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be assumed that dysmegakaryocytic features in the latter disorders are partially generated by small to medium-sized megakaryocytes (diameter less than 30 microns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the relative frequency of promegakaryoblasts in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (range 6-8%) is confirmed by evaluation of the immunohistochemical and cytochemical staining methods (CD61 and ANAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ANAE reaction facilitates the recognition of atypical micromegakaryocytes as well as small megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus cytochemistry provides a better insight into alterations of these cell lineages in various pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
