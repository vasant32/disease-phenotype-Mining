<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The common dilemma in the treatment of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is whether to use intensive myelosuppresive therapy with higher risk of treatment related mortality (TRM), but a chance for complete remission (CR), or to treat less intensively in order to prolong survival time with a better quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective, phase II study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of low dose combination induction treatment consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> at a dose of 10 mg/m2 every 12 h s.c. for 7 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> at a dose of 100 mg/day p.o. for 7 days and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> at a dose of 6 mg/m2 i.v daily on days 1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two induction courses were planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group of 44 patients 12 (27%) achieved CR, 4 (9%) patients were in PR and there were 9 (20%) early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (ED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, performance status, preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, karyotype, WBC and % of blasts in bone marrow were not significant prognostic factors for CR probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following initial factors appeared to be related to a shorter duration of survival time from the start of treatment: age &gt;70 (p&lt;0.03), poor performance status (p&lt;0.03), and % of BM blasts 50 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, despite promising results in the pilot study the efficacy of this induction treatment is not better than the efficacy of other regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hematological toxicity of this treatment seems to be comparable with "3+7" regimen </plain></SENT>
