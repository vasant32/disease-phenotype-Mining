<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only few hematological units use molecular virological methods, such as polymerase chain reaction, for surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adenovirus infection</z:e>, and treatment strategies have never been evaluated in multicenter clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the detection and treatment of human adenovirus (HAdVs) disseminated disease in the case of a 46-year-old immunocompromised female having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>: International Prognostic Scoring System 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and urine samples were tested for the presence of adenoviral DNA using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For additional confirmation, sequencing of PCR products was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With real-time PCR, we detected HAdV DNA in both serum and urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> level constantly decreased with applied oral ribavirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the result of sequencing, HAdVs type 11 was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surveillance of adenovirus by real-time PCR is useful in detecting and monitoring disseminated HAdV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; it is a potential standard diagnostic approach that could assist clinicians to decide whether antiviral therapy ought to be administered </plain></SENT>
