<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful karyotype analysis was possible in 24 patients, of whom 9 (37.5%) showed nonrandom karyotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anomalies of chromosomes</z:e> 5, 7, and 8 were detected in their bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, two new anomalies, del(8)(q22) and +19, were observed for the first time in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were studied for SCE in either BM or peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCE incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 MDS patients studied for point mutations of NRAS 12 and 61 and KRAS 12 and 61, one patient exhibited a base substitution at position 1 of the 12th codon of the KRAS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data, gathered for the first time on the Indian patients, throw some light on the nature of genetic changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of our country </plain></SENT>
