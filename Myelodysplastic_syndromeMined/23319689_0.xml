<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Complex karyotype (CK) is the poorest risk factor in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that monosomal karyotype (MK) worsens the prognosis of patients with CK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS; We analyzed 1,054 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with an abnormal karyotype from the Spanish Registry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to describe the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of MK; the main end points were overall survival (OS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MK was identified in 172 patients (16%), most of whom (88%) presented with CK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variables significantly associated with OS were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; P &lt; .001), bone marrow (BM) blast percentage (HR, 1.05; P &lt; .001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (HR, 1.71; P &lt; .001), platelet count (HR, 1.41; P &lt; .001), karyotype complexity (CK [three abnormalities]: HR, 1.81; P = .003; very CK [&gt; three abnormalities]: HR, 2; P &lt; .001), and abnormalities of chromosome 5 and/or 7 (HR, 1.89; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variables significantly related to the risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were higher BM blast percentage (HR, 1.12; P &lt; .001) and karyotype complexity (CK: HR, 2.53; P = .002; very CK: HR, 2.77; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After accounting for karyotype complexity, MK was not associated with OS or evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the prognostic value of MK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not independent and is mainly the result of its strong association with number of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
