<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that transfection of a c-fms gene carrying a point mutation at codon 301, leads to a ligand-independent transformation of mouse NIH3T3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), point mutations at codon 301 of the c-fms gene have been observed implying an important role in the transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a point mutation of the c-kit proto-oncogene was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sequenced a segment of the c-kit proto-oncogene coding for a part of the extracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This segment was 40.7% homologous to the c-fms region encompassing codon 301 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>c-DNA was prepared from peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, from four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and from three human myeloid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The region of interest was amplified with two rounds of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with nested primers and directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No point mutations were found in the investigated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, point mutations in this segment of the c-kit gene do not seem to play an important role in the transformation process of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
