<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> is a characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, such as the rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, but its mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, data are lacking on the terminal phase of differentiation of erythroid cells (enucleation) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a previously published culture model to generate mature red blood cells in vitro from human hematopoietic progenitor cells in order to study the pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our model enables analysis of cell proliferation and differentiation at a single cell level and determination of the enucleation capacity of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The erythroid commitment of 5q(del) clones was not altered and their terminal differentiation capacity was preserved since they achieved final erythroid maturation (enucleation stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The drop in red blood cell production was secondary to the decrease in the erythroid progenitor cell pool and to impaired proliferative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RPS14 gene haploinsufficiency was related to defective erythroid proliferation but not to differentiation capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> should be considered a quantitative rather than qualitative bone marrow defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation might open the way to new therapeutic concepts </plain></SENT>
