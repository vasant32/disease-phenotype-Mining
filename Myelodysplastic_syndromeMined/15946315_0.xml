<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unusual case of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with indolent clinical course is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 67-yr-old female, had first been diagnosed to suffer from low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo>, in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2001, transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> with an increase in bone marrow blasts (&gt;20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient did not require cytoreductive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather, during the following months, spontaneous improvement of peripheral blood cells with normalization of platelets and decrease in the red cell transfusion frequency, were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In October 2002, she even became transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the bone marrow still showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with &gt;20% blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These blast cells exhibited a monoclonal pattern in the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (HUMARA) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no chromosomal defects occurred during a total observation period of 14 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that clonal stability may have contributed to the indolent course of the disease in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms underlying clinical and genetic stability remain unknown, however </plain></SENT>
