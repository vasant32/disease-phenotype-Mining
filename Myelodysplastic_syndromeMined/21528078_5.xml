<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the prevalence of increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, using immunohistochemistry in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy and near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-malignant colon mucosal biopsies between 2005 and 2007, reported as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221391" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis coli</z:e> in patients who were undergoing routine colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry using CD3 was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucosal biopsies and an intraepithelial lymphocyte count (IEL) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with an IEL count of ≥ 20 IELs per 100 surface epithelial cells were correlated with demographic, clinical and follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further subgroup was evaluated for lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty (8.3%) of 241 cases revealed an IEL count ≥ 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six (2.5%) patients were identified as having lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), of whom, five were missed on initial evaluation (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these five patients were labeled with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, three of the remaining 20 cases were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) and one had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087135" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">unknown primary tumor</z:e> with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two cases of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with an IEL count &lt; 10 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased IELs were not confined to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> as a primary presenting symptom, but were also present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (n = 3) and loss of weight (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemistry using CD3 is of value in identifying and quantifying IELs for the presence of microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
