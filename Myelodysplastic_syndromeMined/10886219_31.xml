<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-18, a novel immunoregulatory cytokine, strongly stimulates type 1 T cells, therefore we postulated that IL-18 may be involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we serially measured serum levels of IL-18 in 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> before and after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with aGVHD had high levels of IL-18 that strongly correlated with the severity of aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that they showed reduced serum levels of IL-18 after appropriate treatment or at a state of resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-18 levels were not affected by the pretransplant regimen, engraftment or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with circulating interferon (IFN)-gamma or IL-12 levels, serum levels of IL-18 showed a more sensitive and specific correlation with the disease status of aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IL-18 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of aGVHD and that measurement of serum IL-18 levels can be useful indicator of aGVHD </plain></SENT>
