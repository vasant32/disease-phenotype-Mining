<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase 1/2 study of the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA) in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, including older untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 54 patients were treated with a fixed dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (15 mg/m(2) by IV daily for 10 days) administered concomitantly with escalating doses of VPA orally for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 50 mg/kg daily dose of VPA was found to be safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve (22%) patients had objective response, including 10 (19%) complete remissions (CRs), and 2 (3%) CRs with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 10 elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 5 (50%) had a response (4CRs, 1CRp's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction mortality was observed in 1 (2%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major cytogenetic response was documented in 6 of 8 responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remission duration was 7.2 months (range, 1.3-12.6+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 15.3 months (range, 4.6-20.2+ months) in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient DNA hypomethylation and global <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 and H4 acetylation were induced, and were associated with p15 reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower pretreatment levels of p15 methylation had a significantly higher response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, this combination of epigenetic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was safe and active, and was associated with transient reversal of aberrant epigenetic marks </plain></SENT>
