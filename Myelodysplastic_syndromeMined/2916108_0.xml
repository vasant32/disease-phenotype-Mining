<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alerted by a high incidence of positive autologous controls in pretransfusion compatibility testing for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, we retrospectively analysed 59 cases of severe hemoblastoses undergoing myelosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (29%) of these patients had a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with the following characteristics: the test was of the IgG and/or C3d type in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases, which reacted with polyvalent antiglobulin sera only; the reaction was very weak throughout; very high concentrations of monospecific sera were needed to elicit positive reactions; free antibodies were never detected in the patients' serum; the eluates of the patients' red cells were non-reactive against a very large panel of test erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these criteria suggested a non-immunologic absorption of proteins under the influence of drugs such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23066">cephalosporins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48947">clavulanic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Timenten (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9587">ticarcillin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48947">clavulanic acid</z:chebi>) was found to be the only common drug which had been administered to the majority of the patients with a positive DAT: 15 of the 17 patients with a positive DAT (88%) had received Timenten against 19 of 42 patients (45%) with negative DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients receiving Timenten thus had a positive DAT, whereas only 8% of the patients without this drug reacted in this way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data document the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48947">clavulanic acid</z:chebi> in the development of a positive DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The literature and our experience show that this kind of unspecific binding of proteins to the red cell membrane is not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>increased hemolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the phenomenon, however, is important for differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> and interpretation of difficulties arising during pretransfusional compatibility testing </plain></SENT>
