<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These aberrations have been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Correlations of clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using classical cytogenetic techniques we found 11q aberration in 17 patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH with dual color locus specific probe for MLL gene was used to confirm or exclude the rearrangement of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole chromosome painting probes and multicolor FISH were performed for identification of chromosomes involved in complex translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Balanced rearrangements of 11q were found in 3 patients, in 14 patients unbalanced aberrations were found with rearrangement (4), deletion (4) and amplification (2) of MLL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients no rearrangement of MLL gene was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between clinical characteristics, type of aberrations, diagnoses and survival of patients was not significant, therefore further studies of larger cohort of patients are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of 11q rearrangement </plain></SENT>
