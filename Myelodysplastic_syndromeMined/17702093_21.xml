<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some patients, CCA/Ph-negative status was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to determine the prognostic impact of CCA/Ph-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors compared the pretherapeutic risk factors (Kruskall-Wallis test), exposure to cytotoxic drugs (chi-square test), and overall and progression-free survival (Kaplan-Meyer and logistic regression analysis, respectively) of 515 patients with mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31690">imatinib mesylate</z:chebi> after failure of interferon-alpha according to whether they attained a major cytogenetic response (MCR) (n = 324 patients), an MCR with CCA/Ph-negative status (n = 30 patients), or no MCR (n = 161 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CCA/Ph-negative status most frequently involved chromosomes Y, 8, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in pretherapeutic risk factors were detected between patients who attained an MCR with and without CCA/Ph-negative cells, except that exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> was more frequent in patients with CCA/Ph-negative cells, and overall and progression-free survival were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 51 months, only 2 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall prognosis for patients who had <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> with CCA/Ph-negative status was good and was driven by the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31690">imatinib mesylate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isolated CCA/Ph-negative cells in the absence of morphologic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> do not justify a change in therapy </plain></SENT>
