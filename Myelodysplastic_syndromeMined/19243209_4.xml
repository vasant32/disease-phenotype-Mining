<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>Multiple myeloma</z:hpo> treatment with lenalidomide-based regimens is associated with risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE), particularly during concomitant use with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of VTE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients treated with lenalidomide is not well characterized and the background risk in untreated patients is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study set out to determine the reporting rate of VTE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients on lenalidomide in the two years of postmarketing experience in the US, and to investigate whether there is a disproportional signal of VTE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients on lenalidomide by screening the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) safety database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> population exposed to lenalidomide was obtained from RevAssist, the company's proprietary restrictive distribution programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VTE reports were identified from the company's postmarketing surveillance safety database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FDA AERS database was used for disproportionality analysis, and signal scores computed using three algorithms: multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and reporting odds ratios (ROR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 7764 MDS patients were prescribed lenalidomide during the first two years of commercial use in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VTE representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> was reported in 41 patients, a reporting rate of 0.53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The computed signal scores did not exceed the statistical threshold for identification of a significant disproportional signal for VTE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reports involving use of lenalidomide without concomitant use of ESAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a disproportional signal of VTE was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reports where lenalidomide was concurrently used with ESAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VTE reporting rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients receiving lenalidomide during the first two years of postmarketing exposure was low (0.53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disproportionality analysis demonstrated a statistically meaningful association of VTE with lenalidomide concomitantly used with ESAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but the association was not statistically significant when lenalidomide was used in the absence of ESAs </plain></SENT>
