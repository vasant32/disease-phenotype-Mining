<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 19 hematological malignant disease patients received the first AHSCT within 12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first conditioning regimen was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> or Ara-C, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> +, TBI, nine of them received BCNU additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the second AHSCT in 4 to 10 months after the first AHSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second conditioning regimen was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (or Ara-C), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> +, Mel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had rapidly hemopoietic reconstitution, the first hemopoietic reconstitution is faster than the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no AHSCT related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow up duration was 1078 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>12 of the 19 patients were still alive during the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year disease-free suvival (DFS) was 63% +/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had more blasts in bone marrow at the second AHSCT than the first AHSCT had greater probability to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DAHSCT can be safety performed as an important treatment method in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
