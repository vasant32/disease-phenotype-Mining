<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, C-terminal truncation mutations lack a transcription regulatory domain and have increased DNA binding through the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp> homology domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp> homology domain, RUNX1(41-214), in mouse hematopoietic cells induced progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of premyelodysplastic animals found expansion of c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells and skewed differentiation to myeloid at the expense of the lymphoid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities correlate with the phenotype of Runx1-deficient animals, as expected given the reported dominant-negative role of C-terminal mutations over the full-length RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is not observed in Runx1-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling found that RUNX1(41-214) c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells have an overlapping yet distinct gene expression profile from Runx1-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an unexpected parallel was observed between the hematopoietic phenotype of RUNX1(41-214) and aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes deregulated in RUNX1(41-214), but not in Runx1-deficient animals, were inversely correlated with the aging gene signature of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, suggesting that disruption of the expression of genes related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging by RUNX1 mutations contributes to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data presented here provide insights into the mechanisms of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> by C-terminal mutations of RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
