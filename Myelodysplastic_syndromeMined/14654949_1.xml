<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, poorly spread metaphase chromosomes and highly rearranged karyotypes with numerous marker chromosomes, are often difficult to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the definition of chromosomal breakpoints multicolor banding (MCB) was applied on 45 bone marrow samples from patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints defined by GTG banding were confirmed by MCB in 8 cases, while in the remaining 37 cases the breakpoints had to be redefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 20/45 cases the breakpoints could only be characterized after application of MCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, 73 different breakpoints were characterized, thereof 33 were previously undescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases showed known acquired aberrations and 21 cases had previously described aberration types such as del(5q-), del(7q-), del(13q-) or t(1;5) as sole rearrangement or in connection with other complex ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a total of 11 cases 19 breakpoints as described before were involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, while in 14 cases 33 breakpoints were identified which have not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, MCB has proven to be a powerful and reliable method for screening of chromosomal aberrations, which considerably increased the accuracy of cytogenetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
