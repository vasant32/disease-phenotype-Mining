<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The WHO classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has introduced new categories with prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the predictive value of the WHO and the FAB classification compared to parameters of peripheral blood, bone marrow and IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, peripheral blood counts, bone marrow (BM) cytology and histology and survival were analyzed in consecutive newly diagnosed adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were diagnosed according to FAB criteria and reclassified by the WHO proposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 150 patients entering the study median age was 58 years (12-90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to FAB, 90 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo>, 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the WHO proposal, one half of the patients with RA changed category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 25 cases with refractory cytopenias with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) and 23 WHO "unclassified" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These last patients presented few cell atypias, favorable IPSS and a good survival as has been described for refractory cytopenias in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypocellular BM was found in 24% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was available in only 85 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, both classifications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values, hypercellular bone marrow and IPSS had an influence on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using the bootstrap resampling as stability test for the model created by the multivariate analysis, the WHO classification entered the model in 73%, FAB in 38% and IPSS in only 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in a setting with a high number of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the WHO classification is the best predictor of survival of the patients </plain></SENT>
