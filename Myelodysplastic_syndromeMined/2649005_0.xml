<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Criteria for the evaluation of chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients the changes in the number of leukemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells are easily quantitatively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The criteria depends on the reduction and recovery of leukemic cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> because considerable parts of complete remissions ended with relapse, the evaluation seems necessarily to differentiate good remission from standard remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For such purpose 5,000 leukocyte differential seemed effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the phase II study of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> drugs, however, it seemed necessary to find efficacy less than remission, to avoid underestimation of drug efficacy because pretreated patients are usually studied in the phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, short term judgment needs to be further studied about the correlation with longterm efficacy such as survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is very hard to evaluate, reduction of blasts and increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells may be necessary for the improvement of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relation of the efficacy and survival seemed necessary to be studied </plain></SENT>
