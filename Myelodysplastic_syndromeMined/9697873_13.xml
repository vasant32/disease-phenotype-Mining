<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), is produced by mesenchymal cells, including bone marrow (BM) stromal cells, and has mitogenic and motogenic effects on a variety of cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a role has been assigned to HGF/SF and its receptor, c-MET, in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the function of HGF/SF on hemopoietic mononuclear cells (MNC) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with circulating blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to results with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MNC, HGF/SF alone stimulated the proliferation and colony formation of MNC from these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MNC from some (4/13) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients also produced HGF/SF (0.1-0.2 ng/ml/day), while we could not detect HGF/SF in cultures from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it appeared that HGF/SF induced migration of leukemic cells in Boyden using KG1a cells as a model for leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The membranes dividing the two compartments of the Boyden chambers were coated with fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HGF/SF significantly promoted migration in 3/5 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and in 5/7 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supernatant of human BM stromal cells, which is chemoattractive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human hemopoietic progenitor cells, also promoted migration of MNC from 4/5 MDS patients and 6/7 AML patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since HGF/SF is one of the growth factors produced by BM stromal cells, a neutralizing antibody directed against HGF/SF was added to the BM stroma supernatant, which reduced migration significantly in 2/3 MDS and in 3/6 AML responders to BM stroma supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HGF/SF promotes proliferation and migration of hemopoietic cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in vitro and may therefore contribute to the malignant potential of these cells </plain></SENT>
