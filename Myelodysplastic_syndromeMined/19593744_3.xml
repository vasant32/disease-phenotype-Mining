<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of the presence of the HLA-DR15 allele on the experimental and clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by assessing the clinical data of 136 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed that the frequency of HLA-DR15 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (38.7%) was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We noted the following observations with regard to disease progression: None of the 46 HLA-DR15 positive patients with international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) scores &lt;or=1 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) during the follow-up period, while six of the 63 DR15-negative patients with the same IPSS score developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> within a shorter follow-up period (p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the incidence of poor chromosomal abnormalities, the percentage of patients with IPSS scores &gt;or=1.5 and the presence of &gt;or=5% blasts in the bone marrow in the DR15-positive patients were lower than the corresponding findings in the DR15-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also recorded the following observations with regard to bone marrow (BM) failure: The bicytopenia/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> ratio in the DR15-positive patients was higher than that in the DR15-negative patients (92.4 vs. 78.3%; p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peripheral-neutrophil count and the platelet count in the DR15-positive patients were lower than those in the DR15-negative patients (p = 0.028 and p = 0.011, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hypocellularity was more easily detectable in the DR15-positive patients (26.4 vs. 16.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the BM CD4+ lymphocyte count and the CD4/CD8 ratio in the DR15-positive patients were higher than the corresponding values in the DR15-negative patients (p &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between the polarization of T-helper (T(h)) and T-cytotoxic (T(c)) cells and the cytokine levels in these two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the presence of the HLA-DR15 allele is indicative of a genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and, the presence of the HLA-DR15 allele showed less association with disease progression and greater association with BM failure </plain></SENT>
