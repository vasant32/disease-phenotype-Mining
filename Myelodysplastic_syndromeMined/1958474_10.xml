<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment schedule consisted of a 14 d course of rhGM-CSF (250 micrograms/m2/d s.c.) for patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), while patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) received a 14 d combination course of rhGM-CSF (250 micrograms/m2 s.c.) and low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (20 mg/m2 s.c.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rhGM-CSF increased the mean neutrophil count from 3.9 x 10(9)/l to 44 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant increases of myeloperoxidase content in granulocytes occurred during treatment (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis and killing of Staph. aureus by granulocytes was markedly enhanced during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microbicidal capacity normalized in four out of six patients during GM-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, chemotaxis in response to zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) and f-Met-Leu-Phe (f-MLP), was further impaired on the last day of treatment, which was associated with a marked increase in the expression of the granulocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> receptors CD11a (P = 0.01), CD11b (P = 0.002), CD11c (P = 0.00015) and CD18 (P = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF therapy did not cause significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> monophosphate (HMP)-shunt activity, chemiluminescence, nor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results show that in vivo administration of GM-CSF is able to repair at least in part the neutrophil anomalies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), which might be useful in modulating host response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, increased adherence and impaired chemotaxis may explain some toxicities observed during treatment with GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
