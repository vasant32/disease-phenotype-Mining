<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of induction of differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells was first proved by cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, and such ability has been also confirmed clinically as a result of observation of the dramatic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and the usefulness of low-dose of ara-C therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied differentiation induction of primary cultured bone marrow cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients by ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> with or without addition of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied clinical efficacy of differentiation therapy in 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differentiation induction effects were observed in 3 of 14 patients treated with G-CSF in combination with low-dose of ara-C or low-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy, GM-CSF and anabolic steroid therapy also showed similar effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, even in a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since these results suggested the usefulness of differentiation therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it is earnestly hoped that more effective therapy, including a concomitant use of cytokine, might be established as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
