<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His peripheral blood showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and bone marrow findings remained to be compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>), but karyotype of bone marrow cells revealed 7 <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> in 17 of 20 metaphases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other laboratory findings revealed decreased serum haptoglobin, positive urine hemosiderin and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resistance of red cell membrane </plain></SENT>
