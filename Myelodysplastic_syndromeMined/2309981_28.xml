<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children with a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were seen at this center over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients, including two pairs of siblings, had a <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 population in their bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had the clinical and laboratory features of "juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>." Three patients could be considered to have either the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 syndrome or "juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>," indicating that these two entities are not mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the French-American-British (FAB) criteria for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 13 of the 14 patients, and consistently involved either <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, multiple abnormalities, and/or multiple clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic progenitor assays of blood and marrow samples obtained from most patients showed abnormal progenitor frequencies, or differentiation patterns in culture (or both), often affecting the erythroid as well as the granulopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, granulopoietic progenitors from four to six patients in the "juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>" category generated predominantly abnormal appearing macrophage colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were poor with rapid transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treated patients responded poorly to conventional chemotherapy, although in two cases remission was achieved with intensive therapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> includes a group of diseases that are clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and current terminology is confused and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Until a better understanding of the biologic and molecular basis of these diseases is obtained, it is proposed that the use of the FAB categories developed for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> might help to improve diagnostic precision and therapeutic comparisons </plain></SENT>
