<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients showed Auer rods in their myeloblasts, but met other criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival of the Auer rod-positive group was 14 months (range 2-27) from diagnosis with survival of 7 months after Auer rods were first observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survival for the Auer rod-negative group was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, both from the Auer rod-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of Auer rod-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, like that of Auer rod-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, was one of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and the development of absolute transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Auer rod-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> is a morphologic variant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndrome</z:e> that may pursue a similar clinical course to Auer rod-negative disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Formulation of a separate treatment approach for those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients who possess Auer rods would appear ill advised </plain></SENT>
