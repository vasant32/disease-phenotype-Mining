<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preleukemic anomalies were observed in 74.3% of the cases, appearing after a mean interval of 68.7 months after diagnosis of the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This interval was only 57.5 months in patients aged 50 years or older and only 42.3 months in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> having received cytotoxic therapy for 6 months or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first changes most frequently observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (24.8%) and isolated erythrocyte abnormalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> (18.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Involvement of two cell lines, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, circulating immature cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was recognized in 19 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median duration of the preleukemic phase was 6 months; 9 months in cases of isolated erythrocyte involvement and 5 months in the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myelomonocytic or monoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> appeared less frequently when the first sign involved erythrocytes only </plain></SENT>
