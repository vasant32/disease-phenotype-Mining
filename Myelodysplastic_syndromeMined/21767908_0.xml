<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Terminally differentiated cells are eliminated, at least in part, by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, whereas part of the apoptotic machinery, including one or several caspases, is required to go through very specific steps of the differentiation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> involve a deregulation of this machinery, which in most cases is a decrease in cell sensitivity to pro-apoptotic signals through over-expression of anti-apoptotic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some situations however, e.g. in the erythroid lineage of low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, cell sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is increased in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-dependent manner and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways are inhibited only when these diseases progress into high grade and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic strategies targeting the apoptotic machinery specifically block cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inhibitors that are over-expressed in transformed cells, mainly Bcl-2-related proteins and Inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> Proteins (IAPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another strategy is the activation of the extrinsic pathway to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, mainly through the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) or agonistic antibodies targeting TRAIL receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of inhibitors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors could make sense when these receptors are involved in excessive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or activation of survival pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the drugs targeting apoptotic pathways introduced in clinics have demonstrated their tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their efficacy, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as demethylating agents and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors, is currently tested in both myeloid and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
