<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Open-label, randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> undergoing induction chemotherapy or first salvage were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> (400 mg intravenous (i.v.) every 12 h for two doses, followed by 300 mg BID) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (200 mg i.v. twice daily for 2 days, followed by 200 mg i.v </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four were excluded because they did not receive study drug (n=3) or received two antifungal agents during the first week on study (nâ€‰=1), leaving 123 patients for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 71 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> developed proven or probable invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e>, compared to two (4%) of the 52 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (P=0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15 patients (21%) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> and six (11%) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (P=0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> is a good alternative for prophylaxis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were associated with a higher risk of side effects in patients receiving i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> or i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
