<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is based on cytomorphology (CM) and cytogenetics (CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) may add important diagnostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the potential role of MFC in the diagnostic setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the authors analyzed the results from 1013 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using CM, CG, and MFC in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concordance between CM and MFC was 82% for diagnostic results in 788 patients who had unequivocal CM results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 225 patients had only minor dysplastic features identified by CM, including 51 patients (22.7%) who had clear evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by MFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients who had no indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> identified by CM had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-typical CG aberrations; in 6 of those patients (50%), MFC revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another 11 of 23 patients (47.8%) who had minor dysplastic features identified by CM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-typical CG aberrations, MFC revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentages of blasts determined by CM and by MFC were strongly correlated (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aberrantly expressed antigens differed significantly between patients rated by CM as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (highest frequencies), suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (lowest frequencies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In various patients, MFC identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-typical aberrant antigen expression in cell compartments that were not rated dysplastic by CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The numbers of aberrantly expressed antigens were correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System scores and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis clearly demonstrated an increased diagnostic yield with MFC when added to CM and CG in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
