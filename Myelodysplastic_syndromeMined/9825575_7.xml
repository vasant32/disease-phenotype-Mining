<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chelation therapy is often necessary for patients who undergo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, the most widely used chelating agent, has been reported to be effective in reducing the iron burden and the transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, compliance with the drug, that is usually administered by slow subcutaneous infusion via a battery operated pump, is often poor, especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To verify efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> by subcutaneous bolus injection as compared to the conventional pump-driven slow infusion, eleven patients affected by oncohematologic diseases were given 2 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> diluted in 10 mL of distilled water over twelve hours by continuous infusion, or by bolus injection in two divided doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean urinary excretion was comparable with the two methods, being 9,183 +/- 4,349 micrograms/48 h after two daily subcutaneous bolus injections and 8,291 +/- 3,970 micrograms/48 h with the slow infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bolus injection was preferred by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eleven patients, who chose to continue chelation therapy by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The iron excretion induced by bolus injection is not statistically different from that induced by subcutaneous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The side effects are acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous bolus injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> is an acceptable alternative to slow, pump-driven infusion </plain></SENT>
