<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza) can impact important immune functions via epigenetic modifications, making it an attractive candidate for pharmacologic manipulation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to study the effects of 5-aza on human dendritic cells (DC) generated from peripheral blood monocytes, and to test the type of immune response induced in patients treated with 5-aza </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the phenotypic level, CD40 and CD86 expression was significantly increased on mature DC exposed to 5-aza (5-aza-DC), compared with control untreated DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mature control DC and mature 5-aza-DC secreted comparable amounts of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, mature 5-aza-DC secreted significantly lower levels of IL-10 and IL-27 compared to mature control DC (p = 0.04 and p = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral blood of 14 patients (7 males and 7 females; age range, 53-81 years) with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) treated with 5-aza, there was a significant decrease of IL-4-secreting CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.001), and a significant increase of IL-17A- and IL-21-secreting CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.003 and p = 0.01, respectively, compared to 5 healthy donors) suggesting a Th17 response pattern in the blood of patients receiving 5-aza </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, these data suggest potentially novel mechanisms of action of epigenetic therapies, such as 5-aza, which may have broader implications for immunotherapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
