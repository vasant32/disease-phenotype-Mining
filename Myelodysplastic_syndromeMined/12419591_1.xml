<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow karyotypes of three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied at diagnosis and revealed, multiple copies of the same chromosomal anomaly, considered as psu idic(21)(q22) associated with other rearrangement(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The karyotype of a fourth patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in transformation showed one copy of a dicentric marker presumably derived from a similar psu idic(21) by (tandem?) interstitial amplification of part of its structure, resembling a "homogeneous staining region", and described as der(21)psu idic(21)(q22)hsr(21)(q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This rearrangement, previously described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> only, might be considered as recurrent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> and associated with an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is most probably a secondary change, because it was never observed as sole abnormality and the main association, as for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, was with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the four cases, the number of partial supernumerary segmental 21pter--&gt;21q22 copies, ranged from 2 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AML1 gene did not appear to be the common target of this amplification because this locus had been lost by the psu idic(21) in one patient </plain></SENT>
