<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether intensive chemotherapy is beneficial to patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) if they are aged &gt;/=60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied 160 patients with a median age of 67 years who received intensive chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At diagnosis, cytogenetic analysis was available in 146 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 78 patients and abnormal in 68 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the abnormal karyotypes, 32 belonged to the high-risk category, ie, they involved either &gt;/=3 chromosomes or chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 94 patients (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CR rates were 70% among the patients who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 69% among the patients who had an abnormal (noncomplex) karyotype, but only 46% among the patients ho had a high-risk karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 9.5 months in the entire group, 18 months in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 6 months in patients with abnormal, and 4 months in patients with a high-risk karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A poor prognosis was attributable to low rates of CR and a high risk of early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the current data, elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> do not benefit from intensive chemotherapy if they show karyotype anomalies, especially those in the high-risk category </plain></SENT>
