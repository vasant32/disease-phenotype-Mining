<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed MDR1 gene expression in 69 clinical samples obtained from 64 patients with leukemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> by using a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay with a heterologous competitor <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To exclude a false-positive result caused by concomitant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes that physiologically express MDR1, in samples we determined a cut-off value of 8 amol MDR1 transcript per microgram of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by simultaneous measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> dye efflux either in lymphocyte or gated leukemic cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, 23 of 69 samples were concluded to be MDR1-positive in leukemic cells per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MDR1 expression rate was significantly correlated with factors such as a history of preceding chemotherapy, elder age of the patient, and certain disease types (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progressed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the complete response rate after chemotherapy was significantly higher in MDR1-negative patients than in MDR1-positive patients (52% vs 17%, respectively; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay established will enable the quantification of MDR1 gene expression in blood samples from patients with leukemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and will be applicable to clinical laboratories as a routine test </plain></SENT>
