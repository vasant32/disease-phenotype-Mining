<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), which developed during third complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-2 was given subcutaneously at 2.5 x 10(5) IU (= 10(5) BRMP units) twice daily for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During treatment spontaneous natural killer (NK) activity was enhanced, circulating lymphokine-activated killer effector cells became detectable and CD56+/CD3- NK cells in the blood doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response in the bone marrow was a reduction in myeloid blast cells (from 7 to 0%), ringed sideroblasts (from &gt; 15 to 0%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (from trilineage to minimal megakaryocytic), and a decrease in metaphases with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> karyotype (from 43 to 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity of IL-2 was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus a relatively low dose of IL-2 caused immune activation and resulted in significant hematologic and cytogenetic response in this case of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
