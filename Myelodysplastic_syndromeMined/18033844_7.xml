<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>What is believed to be the first clinical isolate of Bordetella hinzii in the UK, from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This patient had no known avian exposure, and the source of the organism remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It appears that the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> of the patient increased the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> with this organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with B. hinzii is rare and this species is difficult to differentiate from Bordetella avium by routine phenotypic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmation can be reliably achieved using genotypic methods, and the greater mutational variation of the ompA gene compared to other genes (e.g. <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA gene) allows unambiguous identification of this and other non-classical Bordetella species </plain></SENT>
