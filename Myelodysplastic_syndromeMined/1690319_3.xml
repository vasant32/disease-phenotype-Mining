<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF however has a substantial growth including effect which limits its potential as a differentiation inducing agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore made a systematic search for agents which might restrain the proliferative effects of G-CSF whilst retaining the differentiation stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the agents we have tested on human bone marrow progenitor cells: (6-thioguanine, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, recombinant human alpha-2b and gamma-interferon) only the latter abolished the stimulation of cell growth and retained, or possibly increased, the differentiation effect of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative drugs 6-thioguanine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> both antagonized the neutrophil-granulocyte differentiation inducing action of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">Retinoic acid</z:chebi> and alpha-2b interferon both had weak effects on proliferation and failed to enhance differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it may be possible, by combining G-CSF with a suitable second agent, to utilize its substantial differentiation inducing effect without incurring the potentially hazardous effects of increased leukemic cell growth </plain></SENT>
