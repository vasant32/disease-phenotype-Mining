<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The megakaryocytic ploidy distribution had a peak at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36936">16N</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, at 8N in the 11 of the 15 MDS patients, and at 4N in the remaining 4 patients, which is suggestive of impaired polyploidization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, micromegakaryocytes were shown not to be immature but much more impaired in polyploidization than non-micromegakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in the megakaryocytic ploidy pattern among the type of the modification of Feinendegen' classification in each case for both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, suggesting that the megakaryocytic ploidy is probably determined at the maturation level of the megakaryoblasts or the precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of megakaryocytic ploidy before and after therapy in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts might suggest that the remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients might be qualitatively different from that seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that the micromegakaryocytes or the megakaryoblasts which could not be identified morphologically can be identified immunologically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
