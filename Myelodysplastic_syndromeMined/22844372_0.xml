<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the poorly understood pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the present study focused on analyzing the gene expression profiles of these molecules with whole genomic array using CD34(+) cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These profiles showed that N-cadherin, E-cadherin and c-myc binding protein tended to be downregulated, whereas β-catenin, Ras-proximate-1 GTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP), c-myc promoter binding protein, Rac1, Rac2 and CDC42 tended to be upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no change in the expression of genes involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, with the exception of β-catenin, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The array results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) using CD34(+) cells from a cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) [WHO (2008) RCUD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e>] who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that the cadherin-β-catenin-c-myc signaling axis is crucial in the hematopoiesis of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ras-proximate-1 (Rap1), which is negatively regulated by Rap1GAP, may serve as an initiator of this axis through interplay with cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pathway is strengthened by the upregulation of Rac2, which may allow the nuclear translocation of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aberrant expression of Rho GTPases may also be responsible for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> characteristics observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The two small G proteins, Rap1GAP and Rac2, may act as new molecular markers for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
