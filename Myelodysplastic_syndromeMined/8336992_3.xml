<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two acromegalic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were treated with the somatostatin analogue, octreotide (Sandostatin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A double-blind study of octreotide versus placebo in which pain intensity was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed initially with these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rapid (within 4-15 min) pain relief occurred lasting 2-8.5 h after injection of 100 micrograms of octreotide, an effect that was not reversed by intravenous (i.v.) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 2 acromegalic patients then received treatment for 71 and 82 months, respectively, with doses starting at 500 micrograms/day and 1500 micrograms/day, respectively, without evidence of either tolerance or dependence, although the effect of octreotide on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> appears to be selective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No unwanted sedative effect has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A screening procedure with injection of 50 micrograms of subcutaneous (s.c.) octreotide was performed in 11 other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe pain associated with various conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients (2 with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) reported more than 50% pain relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDD|jodm|iddm">insulin-dependent diabetic</z:e> patients the double-blind check was not performed due to the risk of octreotide-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> the same double-blind check as in the acromegalic patients could not confirm the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may thus be concluded that octreotide appears to be useful for the treatment of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe painful conditions in acromegalic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, since its <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> effect in our patients was confined to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> only, further controlled studies must be carried out in order to determine appropriate target groups </plain></SENT>
