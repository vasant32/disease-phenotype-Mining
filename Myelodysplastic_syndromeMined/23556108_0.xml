<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may offer the best chance of cure for patients suffering from aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, successful outcomes for the subgroup of patients with high-risk disease remain disappointing and lag behind those of lower-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because relatively high rates of relapse are an important contributor to these poor outcomes, efforts have explored approaches to increase the cytotoxic effects of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relapse rates have been shown to improve with the addition of increased doses of total body irradiation (TBI) and/or the introduction of additional chemotherapy to a HCT conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in TBI dose and/or additional chemotherapy has also been associated with a significant increase in life-threatening toxicities, resulting in no change in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been employed as an adjunct to HCT where targeted delivery of radiation may allow for further escalation of therapy to reduce relapse with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review we describe these efforts, including the benefits of escalating the dose of radiation to sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> prior to HCT, the various cellular targets for antibody-mediated delivery of radiation, as well as the rationale for incorporation of various radionuclides such as alpha emitters and beta emitters into the preparative regimen prior to HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, newer novel approaches such as pretargeted RIT (PRIT) are described as a method to further increase delivery of targeted radiation to hematological tissues while sparing noninvolved organs </plain></SENT>
