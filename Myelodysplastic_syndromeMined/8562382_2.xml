<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, B-cell differentiation from the abnormal progenitor was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD40 antigen is a surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which is expressed in B cells and haemopoietic stem cells and is important for B-cell growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the recent mapping of CD40 to chromosome 20q we sought to determine its position relative to 20q deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying 20q deletions placed CD40 within a 19-21 cM interval which is almost coincidental with the common deleted region defined by previous analysis of patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results raise the possibility that genetic alteration of this locus may contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders associated with 20q deletions </plain></SENT>
