<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured serum SCF concentrations by enzyme immunoassay in 85 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were taken in 1988-89 and in 1991-92 and stored at -20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean serum SCF concentration in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was 2.81 ng/ml (range 0.6-8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) than the values for 234 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects; mean 3.30 ng/ml (range 1.3-8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship between SCF concentration and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow parameters, red cell transfusion status, survival or FAB subtype was found, although a trend of decreasing SCF concentration from refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> through sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced SCF serum concentration in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> suggests a rationale for therapy with recombinant SCF in these patients </plain></SENT>
