<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Archived pretransplantation sera from graft failure patients (n = 37) and a matched case-control cohort (n = 78) were tested to evaluate the role of DSAs in unrelated donor HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls were matched for disease, disease status, graft type, patient age, and transplantation year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; 98% received myeloablative conditioning regimens 100% received T-replete grafts, 97% received marrow, 95% HLA-mismatched, and 97% received calcineurin-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 37 failed transplantations, 9 (24%) recipients possessed DSAs against HLA-A, B, and/or DP, compared with only 1 (1%) of 78 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the presence of DSAs was significantly associated with graft failure (odds ratio = 22.84; 95% confidence interval, 3.57-infinity; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the presence of pretransplantation DSAs in recipients of unrelated donor HCT is associated with failed engraftment and should be considered in HCT donor selection </plain></SENT>
