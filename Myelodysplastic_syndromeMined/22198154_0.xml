<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is a complex family of preleukemic diseases in which hematopoietic stem cell defects lead to abnormal differentiation in one or more blood lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease progression is associated with increasing genomic instability and a large proportion of patients go on to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primarily a disease of the elderly, it can also develop after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that CREB binding protein (Crebbp) heterozygous mice have an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, and others have shown that CREBBP is one of the genes altered by chromosomal translocations found in patients suffering from therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This led us to investigate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> development in Crebbp(+/-) mice is preceded by a myelodysplastic phase and whether we could uncover molecular mechanisms that might contribute to its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report here that Crebbp(+/-) mice invariably develop myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> within 9 to 12 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They are also hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and show a marked decrease in poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 activity after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, protein levels of XRCC1 and APEX1, key components of base excision repair machinery, are reduced in unirradiated Crebbp(+/-) cells or upon targeted knockdown of CREBBP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide validation of a novel myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> mouse model and, more importantly, point to defective repair of DNA damage as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of this currently incurable disease </plain></SENT>
