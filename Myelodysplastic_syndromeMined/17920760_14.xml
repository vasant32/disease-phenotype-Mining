<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Using metaphase cytogenetics (MC), chromosomal defects can be detected in 40% to 60% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); cytogenetic results have a major impact on prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that more precise methods of chromosomal analysis will detect new/additional cryptic lesions in a higher proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have applied single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP-A) to perform high-resolution karyotyping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to determine gene copy number and detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using this method, chromosomal defects were found in 82% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients vs 50% as measured by MC; lesions were present in 68% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MC, while in 81% of those with abnormal MC, new aberrations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to gains or losses of chromosomal material, areas of LOH due to segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> were found in 33% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SNP-A findings demonstrate that chromosomal lesions are present in a much higher proportion of patients than predicted by traditional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These lesions may reflect an underlying generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional previously cryptic defects may explain the clinical variability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New lesions may have important prognostic implications, suggesting that, in the future, SNP-A-based karyotyping may complement MC in laboratory evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
