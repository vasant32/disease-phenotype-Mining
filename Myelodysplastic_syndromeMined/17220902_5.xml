<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 22 patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>; n=10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of 12 Gy of TBI and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (3 g/m(2)) every 12 h for 4 days, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> was combined with continuous administration of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stem cell sources were bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings (n=12) and bone marrow from HLA serologically matched unrelated donors (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced disease relapse, two of whom died of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 22 patients, 16 are currently alive and disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse and non-relapse mortality rates are 76.7, 72.2, 16.6 and 14.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that G-CSF-combined high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> could be a promising component of the conditioning regimen of allogeneic HSCT for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, providing a low incidence of both relapse and treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
