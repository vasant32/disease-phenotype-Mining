<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An extensive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that NAG (2p24.3) and ELMO1 (7p14.2) were involved at the breakpoints of t(2;7)(p24.3;p14.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we detected a novel chimeric transcript consisting of NAG and ELMO1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this transcript encoded a truncated molecular form of 3'ELMO1 as the result of a frameshift caused by the chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this study does not provide direct evidence that a defect in NAG-ELMO1 plays a role in the pathogenesis or the leukemic change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it does suggest that defects in NAG-ELMO1 potentially contributed to the leukemic progression in this case </plain></SENT>
