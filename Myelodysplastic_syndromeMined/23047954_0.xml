<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has a key role in signal transduction, we investigated its role in the pathogenesis and evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expressions of HSP90 and signalling proteins clients (phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT), Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> Kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated-FAK (pFAK)), were assessed in bone marrow mononuclear and CD34-positive (CD34+) cells from 177 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of HSP90 inhibition were also evaluated in 39 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins studied were significantly higher in patients with high grade disease, than those with low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of HSP90, FAK, pFAK and pAKT were associated with shorter survival and increased risk of progression into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A down regulation of pFAK and pAKT and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> was observed in mononuclear and CD34+ cells after 12 hours of incubation with 17-AAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest the implication of HSP90 and FAK and AKT activation in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and evolution to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover this signalling network could be a therapeutic target through HSP90 inhibition </plain></SENT>
