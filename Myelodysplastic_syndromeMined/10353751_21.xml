<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the possible association between genomic instability and clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, we compared telomere dynamics to the recently established International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) of 93 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at the time of diagnosis, and telomerase activity was analyzed in 62 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 53 of 93 MDS patients had TRFs within the age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, and the remaining patients showed shortened TRFs (35 patients) or elongated TRFs (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with shortened TRFs had a significantly low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (P = 0.04), a high percentage of marrow blasts (P = 0.02), and a high incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of leukemic transformation was significantly high in patients with shortened TRF length (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with shortened TRF length were frequently seen in the IPSS high-risk group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-low levels of telomerase activity, suggesting that changes in TRF length rather than telomerase activity may more accurately reflect the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with shortened TRF length had a very poor prognosis (P &lt; 0.01), suggesting that telomere dynamics may be linked to clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, an abnormal mechanism of telomere maintenance in subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may be an early indication of genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that telomere stability is frequently impaired in a high-risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and suggests that, in combination with the IPSS classification system, measurement of TRFs may be useful in the future to stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients according to risk and manage the care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
