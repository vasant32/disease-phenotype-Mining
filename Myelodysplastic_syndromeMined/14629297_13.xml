<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency rate of visceral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 27.9% (435/1557) in 1989, 23.0% (319/1388) in 1993 and 22.3% (246/1105) in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparing the rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> in recipients of organ or bone marrow transplantation with that of non-recipients, that of recipients was approximately 10% higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus, at approximately the same rate as in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">candidosis</z:e> decreased to one-half that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> by 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, severe mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> clearly increased from 58.9% in 1989 to 75.6% in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 1000 cases with mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in those 3 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> were the major diseases (40.6% and 34.8%, respectively), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (26.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reasons for increased rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> and of severe mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> can be surmised to be: (i) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">candidosis</z:e> had become controllable by prophylaxis and by empiric therapy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">mycoses</z:chebi> with effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi>; (ii) the marketed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi> were not sufficiently effective against severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infections</z:e>; and (iii) the number of patients surviving in an immunocompromised state had increased due to developments in chemotherapy and progress in medical care </plain></SENT>
