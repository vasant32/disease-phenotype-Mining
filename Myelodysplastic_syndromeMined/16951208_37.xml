<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pilot study was carried out in eight refractory or high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients not eligible for intensive therapy to assess the biological and therapeutic activities of the HDAC inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA) used to remodel chromatin, followed by the addition of ATRA, to activate gene transcription and differentiation in leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperacetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> H3 and H4 was detectable at therapeutic VPA serum levels (&gt;or=50 microg/mL) in blood mononuclear cells from seven of eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This correlated with myelomonocytic differentiation of leukemic cells as revealed by morphologic, cytochemical, immunophenotypic, and gene expression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of the leukemic clone was proven by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showing the cytogenetic lesion +8 or 7q- in differentiating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematologic improvement, according to established criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, was observed in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stable disease and disease progression were observed in five and one cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, VPA-ATRA treatment is well tolerated and induces phenotypic changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts through chromatin remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate whether VPA-ATRA treatment by reprogramming differentiation of the leukemic clone might improve the response to chemotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
