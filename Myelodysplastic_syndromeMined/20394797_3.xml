<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact CD8(+)T subset involved in the regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the target clones of CD8(+)T lymphocytes has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of activated CD8(+)T (CD8(+)CD57(+)) lymphocytes on colony formation (in particular, malignant colony formation) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) from a total of 59 MDS patients were subjected to magnetic-activated cell sorting to separate CD8(+)CD57(+)T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMNCs were cultured without CD8(+)CD57(+)T cells or cocultured with a 1:4 ratio of CD8(+)CD57(+)T cells to study the association between stem/progenitor cell colony formation and the existence of activated CD8(+) T cells, as well as the polarization of T cells towards Tc1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the fluorescence in situ hybridization method was used to detect bone marrow cells carrying abnormal karyotypes, and the proportion of abnormal cells among BMNCs was calculated before and after T-cell deprivation culture in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crossing cultures between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of effector CD8(+)T cells on the malignant growth of BMNCs was closely examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After deprivation of CD8(+)CD57(+)T cells, BMNCs from 33 MDS patients formed colonies in the culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average number cells in the granulocyte and monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) was 40.3/4 x 10(5), and the average number of cells in the erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU) was 10.4/4 x 10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These totals were significantly lower than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group after deprivation of CD8(+)CD57(+)T cells (CFU-GM 83.4/4 x 10(5) cells, erythroid CFU 32.8/4 x 10(5) cells; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After add-back of CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells (four times), none of the BMNCs cultures from any of the 59 MDS patients formed colonies in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 33 MDS patients whose BMNCs formed colonies after T-cell deprivation, the bone marrow Tc1/Tc2 ratio was positively correlated with CFU-GM count (r = 0.443, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Crossing cultures indicated that CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients cocultured with BMNC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor did not show inhibition to colony-forming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 15 MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes, deprivation of CD8(+)CD57(+)T cells significantly increased the proportion of abnormal cells from 43.8% to 56.3% in BMNC culture (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Effector CD8(+)T lymphocytes inhibit bone marrow hematopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; target cells were primarily cells with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
