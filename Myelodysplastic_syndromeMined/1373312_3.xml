<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As probes, centromeric alphoid DNA sequences of chromosomes 1 and 7, a satellite DNA probe for 1q12, and chromosome-specific libraries of chromosomes 1 and 7 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints of the t(1;7)(p11;p11) as determined by banding analysis could be studied more accurately, and the recently proposed designation t(1;7)(cen;cen) was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colocalization of alphoid DNA sequences of chromosomes 1 and 7 by double target in situ hybridisation was demonstrated in metaphase cells and also in interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in situ hybridisation method described is applicable for the screening of peripheral blood cells or archival material </plain></SENT>
