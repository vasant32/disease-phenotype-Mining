<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report five adult patients with spontaneous remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, achieved without cytotoxic or any other treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These five patients represent 1.6% of 307 MDS patients, diagnosed in our Institute since 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to FAB criteria, three patients had RA, and one patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were women, median age of 63 yr (range 32-68 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were without significant complaints and peripheral cytopenia was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow dyshematopoiesis was also mild, mostly affecting erythroid and megakaryocytic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, three patients had cytogenetic abnormalities [+8,+12; +15 and del(16)(q22)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median time to complete hematological and cytogenetical remission was 51 mo, while median duration of spontaneous remission was 45 mo (range 44-60 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As for the follow-up, none of the patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although spontaneous remissions (i.e., "regression") of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are uncommon, better understanding of their basis may lead to crucial advances in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
