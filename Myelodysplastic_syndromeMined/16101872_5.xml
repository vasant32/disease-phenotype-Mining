<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mucous membranes were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1989, she was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that evolved until 1998, when a bone marrow biopsy revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> unclassified in French-American-British Group (FAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient has required periodic transfusions since February 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy of the purpuric lesions revealed a leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; the lesions cleared with topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In May 1999, the patient presented with inflammatory and painful lesions localized on the vulva (Fig. 2), which had evolved over several days, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No lesions were observed in other locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cutaneous biopsy showed an intense dermal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and a diffuse and polymorphous dermal infiltrate involving the follicular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exocytosis, spongiosis, and mucin deposits, demonstrated by Alcian blue stain, were observed in the follicular epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mature neutrophils were predominant in the dermal infiltrate, but a small number of eosinophils and immature cells were also present (Fig. 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The myelogenous origin of the immature lining cells was further confirmed by positive staining of intracytoplasmic granules with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> chloroacetate sterase (Leder's stain) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Routine laboratory tests revealed 3030 leukocytes/mm(3) (60% neutrophils), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 8.4 g/dL, and 92,000 platelets/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 30 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was started, and the lesions cleared slowly within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A new bone marrow biopsy in September 1999 showed a similar appearance to that taken in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient died in January 2000 as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> with cardiac and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old man presented with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0743841" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">febrile syndrome</z:e> that had evolved over 5 days, and painful and pruritic cutaneous lesions on the face and posterior neck (Fig. 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three months before, the patient was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in acceleration phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Examination revealed an edematous and erythematous face with pustular lesions on the surface, also involving the neck and the upper part of the back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic examination revealed an intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and abscesses in the dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The infiltrate of these lesions was composed of mature neutrophils with the presence of abundant immature cells with a myelogenous aspect (Fig. 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Analytical studies revealed 26,130 leukocytes/mm(3) (42% blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>No specific treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> was administered and the lesions showed an improvement within 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Eight days after admission, the patient died as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, before treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was initiated </plain></SENT>
