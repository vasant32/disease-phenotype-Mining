<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we extensively characterize an approximately 2-Mb commonly deleted segment (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e>) of 7q22 bounded by D7S1503 and D7S1841 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 1.8 Mb of sequence have been generated from this interval, facilitating the construction of a transcript map that includes large numbers of genes and ESTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intron/exon organization of seven genes and expression patterns of three genes were determined, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples were screened for mutations in five genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used polymorphic markers from this region to examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells for allelic loss within 7q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we isolated mouse genomic clones orthologous to several of the characterized human genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies using these clones indicate that a region of orthologous synteny lies on proximal mouse chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These resources should greatly accelerate the pace of candidate gene discovery in this region </plain></SENT>
