<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between PGP expression, myeloperoxidase activity and immunophenotype of blast cells, karyotype and outcome was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PGP expression was found in the blasts of 34 of the 82 patients (41%), the majority of blasts being stained in positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PGP positivity was rare in 'low risk' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>: 2/12 cases) as opposed to 'high risk' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>: 25/60 cases) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (7/10 cases) (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PGP expression was positively correlated to the presence of myeloperoxidase activity in less than 3% of blasts (p = 0.025), and CD34 antigen expression (p = 0.04), whereas CD33 antigen expression had borderline significance (p = 0.07), demonstrating that PGP expression predominated in blasts with an immature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormal karyotype, and especially the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, was not correlated to a higher incidence of PGP expression, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for more frequent progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and for shorter survival in PGP-positive cases, but differences with PGP-negative cases were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received intensive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-Ara-C chemotherapy and ten (50%) achieved complete response, including 9/13 (69%) PGP-negative cases and 1/7 (14%) PGP-positive cases (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty other patients were treated with low-dose Ara-C and ten (50%) responded (complete or partial response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PGP-positivity did not negatively affect response to low-dose Ara-C: 4/11 responses in PGP-negative, and 6/9 responses in PGP-positive patients (p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because the treatment choice in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (especially between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-Ara-C or low-dose Ara-C, chemotherapy) is difficult, our preliminary therapeutic results suggest that the analysis of PGP expression could have practical importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings however, will have to be confirmed on larger numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials using drugs potentially reverting mdr, activity could also be warranted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
