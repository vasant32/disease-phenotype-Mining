<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first studied a cohort of 103 MDS patients as well as 46 pathological and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry data were expressed as percentage of positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of erythroid cells showed higher proportions of immature cells (P &lt; 0.001) and decreased levels of CD71 expression on nucleated red cells (P = 0.02) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of myeloid cells showed lower proportions of CD10+ and higher proportions of CD56+ granulocytes (P &lt; 0.001), and increased ratios of immature to mature cells (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since no single immunophenotype could accurately differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from other conditions, we used discriminant analysis for generating erythroid and myeloid classification functions using combinations of immunophenotypic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These functions were prospectively validated in a testing cohort of 69 MDS patients and 46 pathological controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was obtained in 60/69 cases (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No false-positive results were noticed among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between values of these functions and both degree of morphological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the International Prognostic Scoring System were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that flow cytometry evaluation of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is feasible and may be useful in the work-up of individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
