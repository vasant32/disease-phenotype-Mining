<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> episodes of LT were myeloid in origin (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>]) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> French-American-British (FAB) subtypes represented except M3; the most frequent subtypes were M7 (25.4%), M0 (22.4%), and M2 (17.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies during LT were available in 56 patients and revealed a clonal abnormality in 51 (91%): 30 patients had complex karyotype, 2 had core-binding factor gene lesions, and 18 had abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic evolution was documented in the majority of the patients in whom serial analysis was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, LT was fatal in 98% of the cases after a median of 2.6 months (range, 0-24.2 months) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 67 patients received either supportive care alone (48 patients) or low-intensity chemotherapy (19 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, survival was similarly poor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 treatment categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcome of LT in MMM with current therapies is dismal and either supportive care alone or appropriate clinical trials should be considered </plain></SENT>
