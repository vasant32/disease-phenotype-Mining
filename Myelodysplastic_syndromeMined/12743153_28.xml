<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether pattern of WT1 gene expression is a useful marker for establishing prognosis and tracking disease progression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a quantitative assessment of the WT1 transcript amount by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 173 samples (131 bone marrow samples and 42 peripheral-blood samples) from 131 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (79 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> [RA], 31 with RA with excess blasts [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>], 18 with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>] evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and three with deletion of 5q as the sole cytogenetic abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Values obtained were correlated with the blast percentage and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of BM and 78% of PB samples for RA and 100% of BM and PB samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> expressed WT1 transcript amounts greater than the level observed in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of WT1 expression was highly correlated with the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, was much higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compared with RA, and increased during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant correlation was found between WT1 expression levels, blast cell percentage, and the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we found a significant correlation between the amount of WT1 transcripts and the IPSS score, which currently represents the most reliable risk index of disease progression available for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WT1 is a useful molecular marker for risk assessment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
