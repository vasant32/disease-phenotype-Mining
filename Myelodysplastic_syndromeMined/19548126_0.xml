<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrotic process is evaluated by grading the amount of collagen deposited in the bone marrow interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The established method to evaluate bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is staining for reticulin to visualise the collagen fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the extra cellular matrix does not only contain collagens but also other components, e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> of which hyaluronan is the most abundant </plain></SENT>
