<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether bcl-2 plays a role in the increase of myeloblasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and their progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), we studied bcl-2 expression in initial (pre-therapy) bone marrow biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at early (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, RA, with or without ring sideroblasts) and advanced stages (RA with excess blasts, and in transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential biopsies were also studied to evaluate the effect of time or disease progression, including evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, or therapy with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early myeloid precursors (EMPs), predominantly myeloblasts, were identified in paraffin sections after immunostaining; bcl-2-positive EMPs were enumerated as a percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EMPs (Bcl-2%), and by their absolute frequency per x 900 microscopic field (Bcl-2 index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: in initial biopsies, the Bcl-2% and Bcl-2 index in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (9.9+/-2.6 and 1.4+/-0.6, respectively; mean+/-S.E.) were significantly lower than in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (26.4+/-3.6, 4.6+/-1.4), but similar to controls (8.1+/-0.3 and 0.8+/-0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2% and Bcl-2 index in three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (57.4+/-17.9 and 85.1+/-62.4) were similar to values for seven patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (63.0+/-10.0, 98.4+/-29.8) and significantly higher than values for other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2% showed relative increments with time or disease progression (range, 21-273%; 11 of 18 sequential biopsies from six of ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients), which was not clearly altered by G-CSF therapy (four of six patients with, two of four patients without treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: bcl-2 expression by EMPs (in both proportion and absolute number) correlated with initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stage, progressed over time independent of G-CSF therapy, and was associated with evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data provide support for the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression is related to accumulation of immature myeloid cells with increased bcl-2 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
