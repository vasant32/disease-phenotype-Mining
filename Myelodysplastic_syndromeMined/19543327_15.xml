<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discern the impact of 5-azacitine treatment pretransplant on the risk for relapse after HCT, we analyzed the post transplant outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 54 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who received HCT from HLA-compatible donors according to pretransplant 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients received a median of four (1-7) cycles of 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, and 24 patients did not receive 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> before HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 1-year estimates of overall survival, relapse-free survival and cumulative incidence of relapse were 47, 41 and 20%, for 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> patients and 60, 51 and 32%, respectively, for non-5-azacytidine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that outcomes are similar in both groups with a trend toward decreased early relapse in patients receiving 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> may be of value in stabilizing the disease, thereby allowing time for patients to reach transplant and does not appear to affect transplant outcomes </plain></SENT>
