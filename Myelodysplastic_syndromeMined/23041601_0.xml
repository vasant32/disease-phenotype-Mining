<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study using national registry data on 2977 patients who underwent transplantation using a single UCB for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA matching was assessed by serologic data for HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of the recipients at transplantation was 41 years (range, 0-82 years), and 2300 recipients (77%) were age ≥16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival rate was 0.46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of MM only in the graft-versus-host direction or only in the host-versus-graft direction was not associated with overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; P = .317 and HR, 0.95; P = .670, respectively) compared with 1 bidirectional MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent in both the child and adult cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of MM only in the graft-versus-host direction was associated with a lower incidence of nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.65; P = .040), significant only in the child cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No MM category was associated with relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the direction of HLA MM does not have a significant impact on overall survival after UCB transplantation </plain></SENT>
