<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The induction CT consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 6 mg/m2 days 1-3 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> 200 mg/m2 in 12 h infusion, days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF 3 micrograms/kg s.c. was given on day 6 until the neutrophil count was 1 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postremission CT consisted of two similar courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients not in remission after two courses of CT were considered as treatment failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with a median age of 64 years, range 50-79 years (11 RAEB and 11 RAEBt) were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of 22 patients (54.5%) achieved complete remission (CR) and four, partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients were resistant to treatment; there were two toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; seven patients achieved CR after the first course and five after two courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time of neutrophil recovery to 1 x 10(9)/l was day 15 (range 3-22) after the first course of treatment and day 14 (range 4-21) after the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of 22 patients developed febrile episodes after the first course of treatment and nine after the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CR was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival for CR patients was 24 months, for non-CR patients, 12 months; while survival for the whole population was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the administration of moderately intensive CT supported by GM-CSF in "poor risk' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> gives promising results; the response rate is high for this disease, while the incidence of toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF appears to accelerate neutrophil recovery and probably reduces the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
