<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently mutations in codons 301 and 969 of c-fms, preferentially involving TAT-to-TGT at codon 969, have also been identified in these disorders by allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA) protocols for the detection of point mutations in the critical codons of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASRA involves enzymatic digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-induced restriction sites which are specific for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but not mutant alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 N-ras mutations were observed in 10 out of 46 AML patients, consistent with the reported frequency of N-ras mutations when alternative techniques of comparable sensitivity are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, c-fms point mutations were not detected in a similar number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, including 39 studied for mutations in both N-ras and c-fms, and this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A more sensitive technique (ASRA + ASO hybridization) also failed to detect TAT-to-TGT substitutions at codon 969 in a subgroup of M4-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients considered to be at greatest risk of harboring c-fms mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that c-fms mutations at codons 301 and 969 are not important in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in the vast majority of patients </plain></SENT>
