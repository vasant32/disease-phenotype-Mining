<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data indicated that an isolated i(17q) is associated with a distinct type of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorder</z:mpath> with an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 37 to 83 years (median 60) with a M:F ratio of 3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid disorders with mixed proliferative and dysplastic features, making classification difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>11 patients tested for BCR/ABL gene fusion were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low bone marrow blast count (&lt;5%) at presentation was a typical finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had severe myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> which included non-segmented neutrophils and an increase in the monocyte/macrophage lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of one case showed the i(17q) to involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myeloid lineages, but not the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For cases with complete follow-up (n = 11) the median survival was 2.5 years (range 0.83-5.25) and 64% progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following features were identified which defined the haematological disorder associated with an isolated i(17q): (1) adult patient, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid disorder with clonal involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myeloid lineages, (3) mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic features, (4) severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011447'>hyposegmentation of neutrophil nuclei</z:hpo>, (5) prominence of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, (6) high risk for progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and (7) median survival of 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
