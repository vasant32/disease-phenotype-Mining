<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently identified a reduction in the neutrophil surface expression of common beta chain (beta c) of the receptor for granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the etiology of the impaired beta c expression, beta c <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from neutrophilic granulocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls was analyzed by a combination of direct reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine different beta c transcripts were detected, but none was specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, one of the transcripts (beta c79) containing a 79-base intron insertion between exons V and VI was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This 27-kd isoform consisted of the beta c N-terminal 182 amino acids followed by a new 84-amino-acid sequence. beta c79 was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No genomic mutations were detected within the intron or at the intron/exon boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The isoform is predominantly located in the cytoplasm by Western blot analysis and was unable to generate high-affinity binding sites or transduce a signal for proliferation when coexpressed with the receptor for human GM-CSF alpha chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the accumulation of the abnormal beta c transcripts with intron V retention results in the reduction in cell-surface expression of beta c observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
