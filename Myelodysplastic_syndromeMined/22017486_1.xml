<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using newly designed probes that span TET2, in 893 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and validated the new assay by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing for molecular TET2 mutations was performed in 37/50 del(TET2) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified TET2 deletions in 50/893 patients (26 males, 24 females; 44-87 years) resulting in a 5.6% frequency [22/425 AML (5.2%), 15/217 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>; 6.9%), 9/188 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (4.8%), 4/63 myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (6.3%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic alterations (mostly complex) were detected in 35/50 (70.0%) of del(TET2) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TET2 deletions were cytogenetically cryptic in 25/50 (50.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing detected TET2mut in 19/37 (51.4%) del(TET2) cases investigated, predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (10/14; 71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with intermediate cytogenetics, presence of any TET2 alteration was related to worse median overall survival (347 d vs. not reached; P = 0.052) and event-free survival (164 vs. 457 d; P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JAK2(V617F) was found in 6/18 (33.3%) del(TET2) cases analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, TET2 haploinsufficiency recurrently occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, frequently combined with TET2 mutations on the remaining allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of del(TET2) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> should be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
