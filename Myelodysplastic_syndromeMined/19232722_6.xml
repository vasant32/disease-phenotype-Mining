<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy are often performed to rule out an infiltrative versus intrinsic BM process, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously described a flow cytometric (FCM) assay useful in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and demonstrated its good correlation with "gold standard" morphologic and cytogenetic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we prospectively tested the utility of the FCM assay in 102 cytopenic patients with BMs showing neither diagnostic morphological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> nor abnormal cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FCM, following our published criteria, was positive in 22 cases (21.6%), intermediate in 11 cases (10.8%) and negative in 69 cases (67.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 4-24 months), 12 (11.8%) patients were proven to have or/develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or related BM diseases (group-1); 61 (59.8%) patients had their cytopenia(s) attributed to various medical causes (group-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 29 patients, the causes of cytopenia(s) were not found, and some had the features consistent with the recently defined clinical entity -- idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive FCM result was significantly more prevalent (9/12, 75%) in group-1 patients; while a negative FCM result was significantly more frequent in group-2 patients (4/61, 7%) (p&lt;0.0001) with a positive predictive value of 69% and a negative predictive value of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FCM analysis of myelomonocytic maturation has diagnostic utility in cytopenic patients who have an inconclusive BM examination by morphologic and cytogenetic evaluation, and may therefore be a useful adjunct in clinical management of these patients </plain></SENT>
