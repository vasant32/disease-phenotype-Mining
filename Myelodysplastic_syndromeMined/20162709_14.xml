<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (COD) of these patients is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identifying the COD could help to guide early therapy decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the COD in a cohort of 273 deceased patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to the International Prognostic Scoring System at presentation to The University of Texas M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remaining CODs were classified as non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 66 years (range, 19-88 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival was 59 weeks (range, 1-831 weeks) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage of International Prognostic Scoring System low and intermediate-1 groups were 21% and 79%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common cytogenetic abnormality (9%) was del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients received supportive care only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The COD was identified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related in 230 of 273 (84%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most common disease-related CODs were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (38%), transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (15%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most frequent non-disease-related COD was cardiovascular events (19 of 43 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with low- or intermediate-1 risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will die because of causes related to their underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although these results need to be validated in different populations, early therapeutic intervention could be considered in the management of these patients to improve survival </plain></SENT>
