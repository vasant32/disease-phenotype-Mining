<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lenalidomide has significant activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, natural killer (NK) cell expansion by lenalidomide was shown to enhance the cytotoxic effect of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the ability of lenalidomide to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in rituximab-treated NHL cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An in vitro ADCC system was used to assess the ability of lenalidomide to enhance human NK cell and monocyte function in response to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lenalidomide directly enhanced IFN-gamma production via Fc-gamma receptor-mediated signaling in response to IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also a potent enhancer of NK cell-mediated and monocyte-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell ADCC for a variety of rituximab-treated NHL cell lines in vitro, an effect that was dependent on the presence of antibody and either interleukin-2 or interleukin-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide also enhanced the ability of NK cells to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells derived from three patients with B-CLL who have been treated previously with fludarabine plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enhanced NK cell ADCC was associated with enhanced granzyme B and Fas ligand expression and could be inhibited by a granzyme B inhibitor and partially inhibited by antibody to FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced NK cell Fc-gamma receptor signaling is associated with enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase levels leading to enhanced effector function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lenalidomide has the potential to enhance the rituximab-induced killing of NHL cell lines and primary B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells via a NK cell-mediated and monocyte-mediated ADCC mechanism in vitro, providing a strong rationale for the combination of lenalidomide with IgG1 antibodies to target <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
