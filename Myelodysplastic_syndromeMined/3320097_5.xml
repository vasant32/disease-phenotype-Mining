<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunocytochemical staining technique was used to look for circulating cells of megakaryocyte lineage in peripheral blood smears from 67 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small numbers of micromegakaryocytes positive for platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIIa were found in 23 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells superficially resemble small lymphoid cells and are hence difficult or impossible to recognise in conventional Romanowsky stained smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating micromegakaryocytes were found most commonly in more aggressive types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (such as refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t], and their presence may therefore indicate a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the simplicity of this immunocytochemical labelling technique, it could be of wide use in the initial assessment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and possibly for the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
