<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluate: the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO-incompatibility</z:e> and myeloid engraftment; the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD); non-relapse mortality (NRM); GVHD-associated mortality, relapse and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study includes 221 patients with malignant diseases treated in the same institution with the same reduced intensity regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other variables known to affect the transplantation outcome such as age, disease, disease risk, and donor characteristics were well-balanced between ABO-matched and ABO-mismatched transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of our data shows increased incidence of NRM during the first months after transplantation in the groups of patients with major and minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO-incompatibility</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although neither incidence nor severity of GVHD differed significantly among the different groups, we found increased mortality associated with GVHD in the major ABO-incompatible groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term OS and relapse rate were not different, although we observed a trend for decreased OS during the first year post transplantation in the group of patients with major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO-incompatibility</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO-incompatibility</z:e> has an adverse impact on the transplantation outcome </plain></SENT>
