<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological subtypes were refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T) in 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN was administered subcutaneously at increasing doses of 1 to 3 x 10(6) IU per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median duration of therapy was 6 months (range, 3 to 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 patients, both with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, achieved a complete and partial remission, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the complete responder, remission could be maintained for 9.5 months by daily administration of 1 x 10(6) IU IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patients were classified as failures, although in 4 cases a decrease of bone marrow blasts was noted and none of the patients progressed to overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> while being treated with IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T showed a moderate to severe reduction in peripheral leukocyte and platelet counts, requiring premature termination of IFN therapy in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate supportive measures, 2 patients died of pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, IFN therapy had to be stopped because of neurologic toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From these data we conclude that rIFN-alpha 2b at the doses and schedule tried is not a useful treatment for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, however, may be an exception and should further be considered as candidates for therapeutic trials with rIFN-alpha 2b </plain></SENT>
