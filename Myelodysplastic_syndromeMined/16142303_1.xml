<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, combined treatment of cells with VK2 plus 1alpha,25-dihydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> (VD3) resulted in suppression of VK2-inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and pronounced induction of monocytic differentiation as compared with that by VD3 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After achieving monocytic differentiation by pre-exposure to VK2 and VD3, the cells became resistant to various apoptotic stimuli including VK2- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-treatment and serum deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of cytoplasm p21CIP1 along with disappearance of nuclear p21CIP1 was detected in cells in response to 96-h treatment with VK2 plus VD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stable transfectant, U937-deltaNLS-p21CIP1, which lacked the nuclear localization signal of p21CIP1 and showed overexpression of cytoplasm p21CIP1 without monocytic differentiation, was resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a change of intracellular distribution of p21CIP1 from nucleus to cytoplasm along with differentiation appears to be anti-apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefits of using VK2 for treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that VK2 plus VD3 may be an effective combination for differentiation-based therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and also <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> whose cytopenias are mediated though <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
