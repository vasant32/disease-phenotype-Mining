<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human parvovirus B19 (B19) IgG was studied retrospectively in 66 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recipient and donor sera had been stored pre-BMT together with sequential sera thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of donors and recipients had anti-B19 IgG pre-BMT and thus the relative contributions of donor and recipient immunity to antibody production after transplantation could be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, a serum taken 2 to 3 years after BMT was also tested and the results show that persistence of B19 antibody depends on prior recipient (P = .0003) but not on donor immunity (P = .8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings were similar in both sibling and (VUD) BMT volunteer unrelated donor patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of sequential post-BMT sera from 41 of the patients, for whom appropriately timed samples were available, showed primary B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 3 seronegative individuals, whereas 5 others who were seropositive before BMT underwent recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequential results from the remaining 33 patients without recent B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> showed no evidence for donor antibody transfer and confirmed that antibody persistence depends on prior recipient immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B19 IgG levels decreased variably with time and some patients eventually became seronegative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that this long-term persistence of B19 antibody post-BMT is most probably due to the existence of long-lived recipient plasma cells </plain></SENT>
