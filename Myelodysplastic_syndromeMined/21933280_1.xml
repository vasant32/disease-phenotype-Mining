<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous studies addressing this issue have mainly focused on cases in which +21 was part of a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We ascertained the incidence of +21, both as a sole change (T21s) and irrespective of additional changes (T21all), in relation to disease type, morphologic subgroup, gender, and age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MPN, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed on 11 myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with T21s, followed by mutation analysis of the FGFR1, FLT3, GATA1, JAK2, KIT, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, and TET2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of T21s and/or T21all varied significantly among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MPN, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN cases, among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and MPN subtypes, and in relation to the age of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and MPN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 11 cases analyzed by SNP array, a total of nine genomic imbalances, comprising seven deletions and two duplications, were identified in six cases; none of the alterations were recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> (UPDs) were found in five cases; two recurrent UPDs were identified, namely UPD4q and UPD7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in NPM1, RUNX1, and TET2 were detected in five cases, three of which harbored a pathogenic RUNX1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TET2 mutation was found in one of the cases with UPD4q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> are clinically highly variable and that they display a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of copy number alterations and mutations </plain></SENT>
