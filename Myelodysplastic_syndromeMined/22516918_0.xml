<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum TK1 (S-TK1) is a unique biomarker for cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, an optimized [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">dThd</z:chebi>) phosphorylation assay is described, which is as sensitive as the commercially available TK-REA and TK-Liaison assays for measurement of S-TK1 activity in dogs and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from dogs (35 healthy, 32 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 35 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>) and humans (18 healthy, 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) were analyzed using the [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">dThd</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean S-TK1 activities were 1.11 ± 0.46 pmol/min/mL in healthy dogs and 1.15 ± 0.32 pmol/min/mL in healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S-TK1 activities in dogs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> were 24.2 ± 47.9 pmol/min/mL, and the receiver operating characteristic curve showed an area under the curve of 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a cut-off value of 1.9 pmol/min/mL (mean value ± 2 SD), the sensitivity was 0.94 and the specificity was 0.68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very similar results were obtained with human samples (healthy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>S-TK1 activities measured during chemotherapy of six dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were drastically reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, S-TK1 activity increased prior to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>S-TK1 levels in dogs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> did not differ from the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>S-TK1 activities correlated with those determined with the TK-REA and TK-Liaison assays (r=0.92 and r=0.96, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this optimized [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">dThd</z:chebi> assay is fast, sensitive and economical for measuring S-TK1 activity and should increase its clinical use as biomarker </plain></SENT>
