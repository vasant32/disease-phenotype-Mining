<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promoter hypermethylation of the NPM1 gene may lead to suppressed gene transcription and hence functional haploinsufficiency, which contributes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were studied for promoter methylation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of NPM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR (MSP), COBRA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing were used to examine the NPM1 methylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR was used to assess the expression of NPM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NPM1 DNA methylation was rare, occurring in one of 31 cases as determined by MSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in NPM1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the finding suggests that NPM1 methylation is rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and does not play a major role in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
