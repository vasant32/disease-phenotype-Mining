<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This retrospective survey of the EBMT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>Leukaemia</z:mpath> Working Parking describes 78 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (sAML) who were given an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The status of underlying disease at the time of transplantation was prognostic for the two-year disease-free survival which was 60% for patients transplanted in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for those with less advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (50-64%) who had not received any prior intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were significantly less favourable for those with more advanced disease who only partially responded to prior intensive chemotherapy (18%) while none of those who either relapsed or were resistant to chemotherapy survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BMT can therefore be considered as curative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with sAML who have a histocompatible donor should be given chemotherapy intensive enough to induce complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If this is achieved these individuals have a prognosis comparable to those with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission after BMT </plain></SENT>
