<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MPL(W515L) and MPL(W515K) (MPL(W515L/K)) are 2 gain-of-function mutations, which have been found in some Ph-negative MPN patients from Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the incidence of these mutations in Taiwanese Ph-negative MPN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the MPL sequence of DNA samples from 105 patients, including 88 patients with Ph-negative MPNs and 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cytokine receptor MPL exon 10 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at codon 515 regardless of their JAK2 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MPL W515L/K mutations are rare in Taiwanese patients with Ph-negative MPNs </plain></SENT>
