<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study analyzed the role of single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping in prediction of clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) patients following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 MDS/CMML patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> were evaluated with Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array using DNAs derived from marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the best response rate including complete (CR) and partial response (PR) with overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) as secondary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Best response was noted in 14 patients (26.4 %) out of 53 evaluated patients including 12 CR and two PR with median follow-up of 21.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 81 abnormal SNP lesions were found in 25 out of 61 patients (41.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients carrying abnormal SNP lesions showed an inferior CR/PR rate (p = 0.002) and showed a trend of worse OS (p = 0.02 in univariate, p = 0.09 in multivariate) compared to those without SNP lesions, but not were associated with inferior EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of abnormal SNP lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was associated with adverse outcomes following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study is strongly warranted to establish the role of SNP-A karyotyping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
