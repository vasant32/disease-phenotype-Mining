<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many clinical trials have been engaged to prove the benefits of new drugs in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no real progress have occurred in diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, the association of melphalan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> is still the mainstay of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these years, the family of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> have not been totally studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their efficiency in the cure of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> has been early recognised, but still to be based on their anti-inflammatory potency for the dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only few works reported the comparison between members of this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate in this work, in vitro, with a cell line of medium sensibility and a B cell of tumoral origin grew up in our laboratory, that exists some differences in the anti-neoplastic potency of the more commonly used corticoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the order in which we can class these drugs is not surprising and empirically known, the importance of the differences observed need a special attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that these drugs might have stimulatory effects, at various degree in function of their concentrations, on the proliferation of the B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Theses side effects coupled to the efficiency variations of each corticoid present the need of paying more attention to the choice of the molecule implied in the chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
