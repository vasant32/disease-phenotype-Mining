<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The p16 protein is a cyclin inhibitor encoded by a gene located in 9p21, which may have antioncogenic properties, and is inactivated by homozygous p16 gene deletion or, less often, point mutation in several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> often associated to cytogenetic evidence of 9p21 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for homozygous deletion and point mutation of the p16 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), where 9p21 deletion or rearrangement are also nonrandom cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was seen in 9 of the 63 (14%) ALL analyzed, including 6/39 precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, 3/12 T-ALL, and 0/12 Burkitt's ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the 7 ALL with 9p rearrangement (including 3 of the 5 patients where this rearrangement was clearly associated to 9p21 <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>) had homozygous deletion compared to 5 of the 55 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 9p (the last patient with homozygous deletion was not successfully karyotyped) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the p16 gene was performed in 88 cases of ALL, including the 63 patients analyzed by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the cases had 9p rearrangement, associated to 9p21 <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> in at least 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A missense point mutation, at codon 49 (nucleotide 164), was seen in only 1 of the 88 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No homozygous deletion and no point mutation of the p16 gene was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, CLL, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deletion of interferon alpha genes (situated close to p16 gene in 9p21) was seen in only 3 of the 9 ALL patients with p16 gene homozygous deletion, and none of the ALL without p16 gene homozygous deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that homozygous deletion of the p16 gene is seen in about 15% of ALL cases, is not restricted to cases with cytogenetically detectable 9p deletion, and could have a pathogenetic role in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, p16 point mutations are very rare in ALL, and we found no p16 homozygous deletions or mutations in the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> studied </plain></SENT>
