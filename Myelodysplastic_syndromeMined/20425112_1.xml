<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BS69 was originally identified as an adenovirus E1A-binding protein and was found to be involved in multiple cellular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) of BS69 in the genomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CNVs are present in the general population at varying degrees and have been found to associate with various types of diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, most of the current studies focused on the genome-wide screening of CNVs, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> as well as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found significant association between the CNVs of BS69 and these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined the expression of BS69 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the CNVs of BS69 have the potential to serve as a diagnostic indicator, alone or in combination with other markers, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
