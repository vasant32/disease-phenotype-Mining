<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the methylation status of the promoter region of the DAPK1 gene and the expression of the DAPK1 protein in 78 bone marrow samples from untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by PCR and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of DAPK1 was present in 42.3% (33 of 78) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> specimens and was significantly correlated with the loss of DAPK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in methylation frequency among subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAPK1 hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was associated with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in the bone marrow at the time of the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of DAPK1 hypermethylation was found in the unfavorable cytogenetic risk group (12 of 21 cases; 57.1%) compared to the favorable cytogenetic risk group (5 of 20 cases; 25.0%, p = 0.0368) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that suppression of DAPK1 expression by DNA methylation may play a substantial role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
