<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that in the setting of an adequate CC study, FISH would correlate with microscopic genetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5, 7, 8, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed FISH for -5/5q, -7/7q, +8, and del(20q) on 102 MDS cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CC (&gt; or =20 consecutive metaphases) and on 35 MDS cases with abnormal CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 102 MDS cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CC, only 1 was discrepant between FISH (showing +8) and CC (&lt;1% of total cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 MDS cases with abnormal CC, 1 showed a minor discrepancy (-5 by CC vs del(5q) by FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> abnormalities (-5/5q, -7/7q, +8, and del(20q)) correlates with an adequate karyotypic result without increased sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we recommend that FISH not be performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with an adequate karyotype </plain></SENT>
