<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to identify the most significant prognostic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) taking into account both their values at clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and their changes in time and to develop a dynamic model for predicting survival and leukemic evolution that can be applied at any time during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a learning cohort of 426 MDS patients diagnosed at the Department of Hematology, San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, between 1992 and 2004, and a validation cohort of 739 patients diagnosed at the Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, between 1982 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox models with time-dependent covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most important variables for the prognostic model were WHO subgroups, karyotype, and transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined a WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) that was able to classify patients into five risk groups showing different survivals (median survival from 12 to 103 months) and probabilities of leukemic evolution (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WPSS was shown to predict survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> progression at any time during follow-up (P &lt; .001), and its prognostic value was confirmed in the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WPSS is a dynamic prognostic scoring system that provides an accurate prediction of survival and risk of leukemic evolution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at any time during the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This time-dependent system seems particularly useful in lower risk patients and may be used for implementing risk-adapted treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
