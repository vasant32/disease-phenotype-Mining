<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the value of interval fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detection of abnormal karyotypes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics (CC) and interval FISH methods were carried out to analyze the bone marrow cells in 80 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that using FISH, 53.8% cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (43/80) were found with abnormal karyotypes which was higher than 21.3% detected by CC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference between the 2 methods in detecting abnormal karyotypes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes, more chromosome abnormal were detected by FISH than by CC, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detecting rate in patients with intermediate risk of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) also had a statistical difference between FISH and CC methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the FISH is more sensitive than CC in detection of abnormal karyotypes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and is informative for the cases with karyotype failure or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype tested by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is mainly embodied in the intermediate risk cases of IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> may benefit more from FISH for diagnosis compared with other WHO subtypes </plain></SENT>
