<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, but without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) may be taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to make an accurate diagnosis because different treatments are used for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and hematologic features of patients who were initially diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> but had cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cytogenetic studies of 100 patients who were diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> from 2004 to 2009 at Mokdong Hospital of Ewha Womans University based on clinical features and hematologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow pathology was re-evaluated based on 2008 WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed by 24-48 hr culture of bone marrow aspirates without using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and 20 metaphases were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 100 patients diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> initially, three patients (3%) had cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>-related symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was found accidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of megakaryocytes in bone marrow were increased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was not found in megakaryocyte, erythroid, and myeloid cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of blasts was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities found were der(1;7)(q10;p10), add(9)(q12), or t(7;11)(p22;q12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or diagnosis of idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) was made according to 2008 WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the follow up, disease progression was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, cytogenetic analysis should be done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If specific clonal chromosomal abnormality is found, presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has to be considered and close follow up is needed </plain></SENT>
