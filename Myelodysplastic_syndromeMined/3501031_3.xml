<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered that the greatly decreased hemopoiesis in these cases is responsible for their clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated inhibitory activity (LIA), which inhibited human granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) suppressive to granulocyte-macrophage colony formation were present in 3 of 5 cases of de novo AL and in 3 of 4 cases of AL following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PB MNC-cultured media from these cases also suppressed colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elution patterns of LIA of these cases were almost identical in gel chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LIA may be responsible for the suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulopoiesis in some patients with AL developed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that the profound derangement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoietic capability in these cases may be due to multiple complex factors </plain></SENT>
