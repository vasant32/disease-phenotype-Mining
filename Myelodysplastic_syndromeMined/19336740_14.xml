<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HCTCI captured more comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both scoring systems had prognostic relevance, but the HCTCI more clearly distinguished between low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survival times of the different risk groups according to the HCTCI were 68, 34 and 25 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HCTCI showed prognostic impact in the IPSS intermediate- and high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate regression analysis, only the HCTCI remained a prognostic factor independent of IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering their prognostic impact, comorbidities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients should receive appropriate attention in clinical trials as well as day-to-day clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
