<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five years before admission she had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alerted us to the possibility of the presence of t(8;21) before cytogenetic results were obtained, and AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> fusion transcript was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She achieved complete remission after one course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She has remained in complete remission for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that recognition of typical morphological features for de novo M2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with t(8;21) would be important in diagnosis of therapy related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with this translocation, which could respond to an intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
