<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the c-ets1 gene (located at 11q23) in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients displaying a chromosome change at band 11q23 to ascertain any association between this oncogene and the chromosome change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides the chromosome change at 11q23, the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients also showed other numerical and structural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells from the first case showed a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, t(?;11;22)(?;p11 or q11----q23;q11), resulting in a Ph-like chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither a transposition nor a rearrangement of the c-ets1 gene was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells of the second case showed unidentified chromosomal material attached to bands 11q23 and 6q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blot study, however, revealed that these cells carried an amplified c-ets1 gene associated with the chromosomal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases studied, the amount of c-ets1 related message was the same whether amplification of the c-ets1 gene was present or not, and the level of the c-ets1 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells was very low </plain></SENT>
