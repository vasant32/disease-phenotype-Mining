<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell immunophenotypes of 136 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocytosis</z:e> accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hematopoiesis</z:mp> of bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry, the detected results were evaluated by flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS), and the sensitivity and specificity of positive results were determined by FCSS also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlation of results detected by FCSS to traditional diagnosis method was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that 111 out of 136 cases were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 25 were diagnosed as non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 111 MDS cases, 85 cases were FCSS positive, 18 cases were FCSS intermediate and 8 cases were FCSS negative, whereas in 25 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases 24 cases were FCSS negative, 1 case was FCSS intermediate and no case was FCSS positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of FCSS in identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 76.6%, and the specificity of FCSS was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation of FCSS to traditional method (R = 0.613, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the various abnormalities of immunophenotyping are found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in which the main immunophenotype abnormality and the abnormality involving two cell lineages are key points to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
