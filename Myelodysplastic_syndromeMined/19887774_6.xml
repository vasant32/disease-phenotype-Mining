<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of the second allo-SCT in 25 patients who received at least 2 allografts from related/unrelated donors due to relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> after the first SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A minority of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients had reached complete hematological remission before the second SCT (6/25, 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduced conditioning strategies were performed in the majority (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 cases with available data after the second SCT, but relapse was seen in 11/25 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-47), 8/25 patients (32%) were still alive, and of those, 6 (24%) were in stable remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases mortality was associated to relapse and in 8 cases to transplant-related causes (treatment-related mortality; 8/25, 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a second SCT offers the chance of stable remission for some patients relapsing with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> after a first allo-SCT, although high treatment-related mortality and relapse rates remain a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efforts should concentrate on an optimization of conditioning strategies, immunosuppression and post-transplant surveillance for this specific situation </plain></SENT>
