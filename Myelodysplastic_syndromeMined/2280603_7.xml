<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 42 (range 18-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, there were 9 RA, 6 RAEB, 13 RAEB-T, 9 CMML but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 3 a history of occupational exposure to potential carcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients received intensive chemotherapy (at diagnosis or during the evolution) but only 8 (38%) achieved complete remission (CR), and median CR duration was 10 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly shorter survival was seen in patients who had circulating blasts, Bournemouth score greater than 1 or 2, abnormal karyotype (especially <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
