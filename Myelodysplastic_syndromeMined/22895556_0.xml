<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a clinical trial of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> plus aclacinomycin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (AA) treatment (DAA) for 20 patients with refractory/relapsed de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in order to examine its efficacy and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, P15(ink4b) methylation status was analyzed (for 15 patients) pre- and post-DAA treatment, and in vitro drug sensitivity tests were performed for seven patients (AA or AA + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) to explore the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in this combination treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients (55.0 %) achieved complete remission (CR) after DAA treatment, including 7 of whom reached CR after only one treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other two patients achieved partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median OS for those who achieved CR was significantly longer than that of patients with no response (NR; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment regimen was well tolerated, and there was no treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of P15(ink4b) methylation decreased significantly in six patients who achieved CR, whereas very few changes in P15 (ink4b) methylation were detected for the five patients with NR following DAA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data from the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> thiazolyl tetrazolium assays showed that the inhibition rates of AA and DAA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that induction therapy with DAA for refractory/relapsed de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> achieved high levels of CR and improved OS and demonstrated adequate tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> component of DAA may function through a demethylation effect </plain></SENT>
