<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While clinical responses are attributed to epigenetic effects and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in malignant cells, these azanucleosides also affect antitumor immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NK cells as components of innate immunity may confine development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerous therapeutic strategies presently aim to reinforce NK reactivity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We here comparatively analyzed the effect of the two clinically available azanucleosides and report that NK cytotoxicity and IFN-Î³ production are significantly impaired by pharmacological concentrations of azacytidine but enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was not due to alterations in the target cells but caused by direct effects on NK cells depending on the chemical modifications by which azanucleosides differ from their physiological analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although azacytidine impaired <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in NK cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> did not per se alter NK cell viability or reactivity but enhanced responsiveness to activating stimuli by inducing transcription of genes involved in NK reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tantalizingly, these effects were independent of incorporation of the azanucleosides into DNA during cell division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While azacytidine impairs NK antitumor immunity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> augments NK reactivity by yet unidentified mechanisms and may thus serve well in therapeutic strategies combining its effects on malignant cells with its ability to enhance NK functions </plain></SENT>
