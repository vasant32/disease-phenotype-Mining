<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study of 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 168 matched controls within a cohort of 2 739 patients receiving autotransplants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at 12 institutions (1989-1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed abstraction of medical records was undertaken to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pre- and posttransplantation therapy, and transplantation-related procedures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that type and intensity of pretransplantation chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> are important risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following autotransplantation </plain></SENT>
