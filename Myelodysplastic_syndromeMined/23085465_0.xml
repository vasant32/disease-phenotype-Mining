<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effects of DNMTIs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived cell line MDS92 and its blastic subline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cell lines were sensitive to DNMTIs, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L was the most susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAC-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L was preceded by DNA damage-induced G2 arrest via a p53-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AZA did not influence the pattern of cell cycle, although it induced DNA damage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) of DAC or AZA on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-L cells was associated with the dose inducing the maximal hypomethylation in long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) methylation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AZA suppressed the level of methylation in a time-dependent manner (days 4, 7, and 10), whereas DAC maintained the level of methylation from day 4 to 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a decreased with the suppression of growth and methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this study provides in vitro models for understanding the effects of DNMTIs on cell growth and gene regulation, including differences in the possible action mechanism of DAC and AZA </plain></SENT>
