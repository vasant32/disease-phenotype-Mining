<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-214662, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24017">farnesyl</z:chebi> transferase (FTase) inhibitor, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, or previously untreated but poor candidates for chemotherapy, were included in this phase I study with a 3 + 3 dose escalation design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMS-214662 was administered as a 1-hour bolus once weekly at doses of 42 to 157 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once the MTD was identified, the schedule was changed to a 24-hour continuous infusion once weekly (starting dose, 300 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated at a dose of 42 (n = 1), 56 (n = 3), 84 (n = 3), 118 (n = 13), 157 (n = 6) or 300 mg/m2 (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DLT occurred in 3 patients at 157 mg/m2, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> and cardiovascular problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No DLT occurred with 24-hour continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTD with a 1-hour infusion was 118 mg/m2, with no MTD identified with the 24-hour infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of BMS-214662 correlated with the dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of FTase activity of approximately 60% occurred after the infusion with recovery to near baseline after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients had evidence of antileukemia activity, including two with complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, one with hematologic improvement, and two with morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMS-214662 is well tolerated at doses of up to 118 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile and efficacy may be improved with prolonged exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of this agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
