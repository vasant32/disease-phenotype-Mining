<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, no increase of blast cells and excessive expansion of megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although mild increase of bone marrow reticulin fiber was observed, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore he was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and treated with low dose Ara-C regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission was achieved in June 1987, but the relapse occurred in Oct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His bone marrow at the relapse showed more remarkable dysplastic change than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential bone marrow examinations thereafter, revealed an increase of megakaryocytic lineage, especially immature dysplastic megakaryocytes, leading to the appearance of the abnormal megakaryoblasts (detected with anti GP IIb/IIIa antibody) as well as uncharacterized blast cells in his terminal stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to megakaryocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was strongly suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He died of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in March 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The invasion of abnormal immature megakaryocytic cells including megakaryoblasts was observed in liver, spleen and lymph nodes at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are several reports on cases having a common hematological features such as 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in peripheral blood, 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, 3) excessive growth of megakaryocytic lineage, 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, although other clinical features were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases should be reviewed at the point of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mainly involved in megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
