<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cladribine (2-CdA) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogue that exhibits activity against a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and has a potent immunosuppressive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a novel 2-CdA-based reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 16 scheduled patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> were enrolled for comparison of their data with conventional stem cell transplantation (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen for RIST consisted of 2-CdA (0.11 mg/kg/day for 6 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg/day for 2 days), and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day for 4, 2, or 0 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 6), and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After RIST, four patients died before day 100 as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> (n = 1), disseminated candidasis (n = 1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on day 140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase regimen-related toxicities &gt;grade III were observed in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Engraftment and complete donor chimerism were achieved by day 28 in 14 evaluable patients, and 6 of them (43%) experienced grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 328 days (range, 231-633 days), the actuarial 1-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 69% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, among seven high-risk patients (five patients had been in complete remission two or more times and two not in complete remission with refractory disease at transplant), only two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse after RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the recovery of CD4+ cells was significantly slower (P = 0.02) in RIST than in conventional stem cell transplantation, the incidence of clinically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this novel regimen containing 2-CdA is well tolerated and induces early complete donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The unexpected durable remission achieved in patients with advanced disease at transplant suggests the presence of an acceptable antileukemia/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect, which would warrant a further clinical trial </plain></SENT>
