<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases were evaluated for the presence of Auer rods, distinct chunky cytoplasmic blast cell granules, promyelocyte increase, cytoplasmic perinuclear clearing (hofs) of blast cells, eosinophil increase, andfeatures of associated trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of immunophenotyping studies for CD19, CD34, and CD56 expression were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of de novo and therapy-related t(8;21) disease shared common morphologic features of chunky cytoplasmic granules, perinuclear hofs, and promyelocyte increases that were not seen consistently in the t(n;21) group of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>De novo and therapy-related t(8;21) disease, however, differed by the frequent presence of associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in both t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> groups, which was infrequent in the de novo t(8;21) group </plain></SENT>
