<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basophilic crisis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> are well recognized features of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In other myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, however, transformation with marked basophilia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> is considered unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We examined the long-term follow-up of 322 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to define the frequency of basophilic, eosinophilic and mixed lineage (basophilic and eosinophilic) transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, only one developed mixed lineage crisis (&gt;or= 20% basophils and &gt;or= 20% eosinophils) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this patient, who initially suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>, basophils increased to 48% and eosinophils up to 31% at the time of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mixed lineage crisis was not accompanied by an increase in blast cells or organomegaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of BCR/ABL and other relevant fusion gene products (FIP1L1/PDGFRA, AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>, PML/RAR alpha, CBF beta/MYH11) were excluded by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myelomastocytic transformation/myelomastocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mast cell disease</z:e> were excluded by histology, KIT mutation analysis, electron microscopy and immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basophils were thus found to be CD123+, CD203c+, BB1+, KIT- cells, and to express a functional IgE-receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> examined, 4(1.2%) were found to have marked basophilia (&gt;or= 20%) and 7(2.1%) were found to have massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> ( &gt;or= 20%), whereas mixed-lineage crisis was detected in none of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mixed basophil/eosinophil crisis may develop in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but is an extremely rare event </plain></SENT>
