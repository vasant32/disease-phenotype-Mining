<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the time sequence of occurrence of p15(INK4B) gene methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and its correlation with leukaemic transformation and survival of patients, the methylation status of the p15(INK4B) promoter region was analysed in 50 patients and was serially studied in 22 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 patients, 17 (34%) showed p15(INK4B) gene methylation, first demonstrated at diagnosis or during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When FAB subtypes at the time of study were used in the analysis, the incidence of (p15INK4B) methylation in each risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remained stable throughout the course: 0% for low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ring sideroblasts] and from 23% at diagnosis to 30% for high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>] respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of p15(INK4B) methylation rose to 60% at initial study and, finally, to 75% in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (69%) with p15(INK4B) methylation showed disease progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; it could be detected before, at the time or after the diagnosis of leukaemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p15(INK4B) methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients implicated a shorter survival time in univariate analyses, but its prognostic significance disappeared in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p15(INK4B) methylation can be detected early at the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or acquired during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and is related to leukaemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
