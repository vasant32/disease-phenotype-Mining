<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to the influence of monocyte count, degree of blastic infiltration and ring sideroblasts and on the clinical presentation and the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocyte count clearly distinguishes between two groups of patients with different haematological profile and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> frequently changed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and had shorter survival rates compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of blastic infiltration does not affect the haematological presentation and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, increased blastic infiltration is associated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ringed sideroblasts presented with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> but the clinical course of the disease did not differ from the remainder </plain></SENT>
