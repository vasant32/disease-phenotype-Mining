<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The complete cytogenetic investigation of human oocytes and the corresponding first polar bodies (PBs) derived from an 18-year old female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A whole-genome amplification method combined with comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) was employed for the analysis of 14 oocytes and their corresponding first PBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chromosome abnormalities were detected in two oocyte-PB complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One oocyte had lost X-chromosome material (23,X,-Xcht), while its corresponding first PB showed the reciprocal gain (23,X,+Xcht) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> involving loss of chromatids for chromosomes X and 21 was identified in another first PB (23,X,-21cht,-Xcht) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> was attributed to unbalanced pre-division of chromatids at meiosis I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Meiotic errors in chromosome segregation can occur even in oocytes derived from young women, confirming the existence of age-independent factors contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such factors are of relevance to fertility, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> and preimplantation <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> screening for the purposes of increasing IVF success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reliability of CGH in examining the whole chromosome complement of a single cell and of being able to detect chromatid anomalies is confirmed by this study </plain></SENT>
