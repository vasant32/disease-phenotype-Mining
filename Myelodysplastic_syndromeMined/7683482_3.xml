<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), marrow progenitor cells from 13 MDS patients were highly purified using monoclonal antibodies including CD34 and immunomagnetic microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells positive for CD34 in the purified cells were in the range from 87% to 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These purified cells were cultured in serum-free medium with individual colony stimulating factors (CSFs) to investigate whether CD34+ cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have abnormal responses to individual CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose response experiments with the purified CD34+ cells and recombinant human macrophage-CSF (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3) or erythropoietin (rEP) were performed in serum-free fibrin clots in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed a diminished response to rG-CSF and one patient to rEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six patients the purified CD34+ cells did not respond to a stimulation of any individual CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the progenitor cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormalities</z:hpo> in these disorders involve a defect in the capacity of progenitor cells to respond to stimulation with G-CSF, and present direct evidence for the manner in which myelodysplastic CD34+ cells are impaired </plain></SENT>
