<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 60% (16/25) of tAL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were MSI(+) in contrast to &lt;4% (0/28) of de novo cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>hMLH1 gene silencing was rare and evidence of promoter methylation was found in less than one-third of the MSI(+) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the GIMEMA patients who had been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> there was an apparent trend towards early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">breast disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there might be common predisposing factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and tAL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also three examples of mutations in the MRE11 gene among the 25 tAL/MDS cases suggesting that defective recombinational DNA repair may promote the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSI(+) tAL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly associated with previous chemotherapy and the frequency of MSI(+) among radiotherapy patients was considerably lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the established relationship between drug resistance and mismatch repair defects, we suggest that selection for therapeutic drug resistance may contribute to the incidence of MSI(+) tAL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
