<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported comparable survival and relapse rates after T cell-depleted (TCD) allo-HSCT compared with unmodified transplantations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with significantly decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a 56-patient retrospective study to evaluate TCD allo-HSCT for the treatment of ALL after myeloablative total body irradiation-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates for patients with ALL after TCD allo-HSCT were 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.52) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19-0.44), respectively, and the 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 0.38 (95% CI, 0.25-0.50) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20-0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward improved survival of patients who underwent TCD allo-HSCT in first complete remission compared with those who did so in other remission states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at 1 year was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.10-0.31), and no patients developed grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in 41 evaluable patients at 2 and 5 years was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.04-0.26), and that of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD at 2 and 5 years was 0.05 (95% CI, 0-11.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate OS and DFS rates that compare favorably to unmodified allo-HSCT with lower rates of GVHD </plain></SENT>
