<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new member of the human origin recognition complex (ORC) was cloned and identified as ORC5L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HsORC5p is a 50-kDa protein whose sequence is 38% identical and 62% similar to ORC5p from Drosophila melanogaster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two alleles of ORC5L were identified, one with and one without an evolutionarily conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26395">purine nucleotide</z:chebi> binding motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HsORC5p is precipitated from cell extracts with HsORC2p and HsORC4p, indicating that it is part of the putative human ORC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bulk of HsORC5p is in an insoluble nuclear fraction, whereas the other known human ORC subunits (HsORC1p, HsORC2p, and HsORC4p) are easily extracted in the nuclear-soluble fractions and in S100 (HsORC1p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified an alternatively spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from the same locus (HsORC5T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HsORC5Tp also formed a complex with HsORC4p but not with HsORC2p, suggesting it may play a regulatory role in the assembly of different ORC subcomplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HsORC5, HsORC5T, and HsORC4 transcripts are abundant in spleen, ovary, and prostate in addition to tissues with high levels of DNA replication like testes and colon mucosa, implicating the human ORC proteins in functions besides DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the gene for ORC5L is located at chromosome 7, band q22, in the minimal region deleted in 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine leiomyomas</z:hpo> and in 10-20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
