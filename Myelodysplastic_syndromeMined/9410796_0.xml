<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was administered two cytokines: granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed by rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient remained transfusion free for more than 4 months until his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from causes not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or the therapy he received </plain></SENT>
