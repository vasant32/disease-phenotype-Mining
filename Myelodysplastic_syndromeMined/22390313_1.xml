<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While lenalidomide (LEN) shows high efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with del[5q], responses can be also seen in patients presenting without del[5q] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that improved detection of chromosomal abnormalities with new karyotyping tools may better predict response to LEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied clinical, molecular and cytogenetic features of 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPN), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndromes</z:e> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) without del[5q] by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) who underwent therapy with LEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping marginally increased the diagnostic yield over MC, detecting 2/42 (4.8%) additional cases with del[5q], one of whom were responded to LEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were more often observed in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype by MC (60% vs abnormal MC; 17%, p = .08) and those with gain of chromosome 8 material by either of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 karyotyping methods (83% vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other chromosomal abnormalities; 44% p = .11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 5 out of those 6 patients received combined LEN/AZA therapy and it may also suggest those with gain of chromosome 8 material respond well to AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of FISH or SNP-A did not improve the predictive value of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics by MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of TET2, UTX, CBL, EZH2, ASXL1, TP53, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, IDH1/2, and DNMT-3A was performed on 21 of 41 patients, and revealed 13 mutations in 11 patients, but did not show any molecular markers of responsiveness to LEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> karyotype and gain of chromosome 8 material was predictive of response to LEN in non-del[5q] patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
