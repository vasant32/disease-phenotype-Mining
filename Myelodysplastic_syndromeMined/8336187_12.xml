<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were treated with oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose levels were 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least three patients were treated on each dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common side effects were mucocutaneous dryness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting side effects were diverse and included dermatitic problems, <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum-tolerated dose was 150 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one response was seen among 29 patients considered assessable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> can be safely administered to patients at doses up to 150 mg/m2/d for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, as administered in this study, this compound does not appear to have significant activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
