<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few non-clinical studies have directly compared the mechanisms of action of these agents in a head-to-head fashion, and the agents are often viewed as mechanistically similar DNA hypomethylating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the similarities and differences in mechanisms of these drugs, we compared their in vitro effects on several end points in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both drugs effected DNA methyltransferase 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, DNA hypomethylation, and DNA damage induction, with DAC showing equivalent activity at concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At concentrations above 1 microM, AZA had a greater effect than DAC on reducing cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both drugs increased the sub-G1 fraction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> markers, with AZA decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell cycle phases and DAC causing an increase in G2-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total protein synthesis was reduced only by AZA, and drug-modulated gene expression profiles were largely non-overlapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate shared mechanisms of action of AZA and DAC on DNA-mediated markers of activity, but distinctly different effects in their actions on cell viability, protein synthesis, cell cycle, and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential effects of AZA may be mediated by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> incorporation, as the distribution of AZA in nucleic acid of KG-1a cells was 65:35, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>:DNA </plain></SENT>
