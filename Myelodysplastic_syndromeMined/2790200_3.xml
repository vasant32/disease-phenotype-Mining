<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the current standards these cases would be classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of five patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> within approximately 1 1/2 months of developing greater than 30% peripheral blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these four patients had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> by criteria other than marrow involvement at the time of presentation: one patient had evidence of multifocal dermal involvement; and the other patient had a cytogenetic abnormality, t(8;21), found predominantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> 2 years after initial presentation with greater than 30% peripheral blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although our series of patients is small, it does suggest that patients who have greater than 30% peripheral blasts should be considered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, even with less than 30% marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
