<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was a 33-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>) who received bone marrow transplantation from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sister who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100647'>Graves disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithyroid antibodies, including antimicrosomal antibody and antithyroglobulin antibody, appeared 4 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> appeared 7 months after transplantation, and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothyroid</z:e> state was noted 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other case was a 50-year-old woman with Sjgrens syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> who was diagnosed with peripheral T cell non-Hodgkins <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from her histocompatible sister owing to only partial response to traditional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and remission of Sjgrens syndrome was noted 4 years after PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two illustrative cases, one of acquisition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and the other of remission of Sjgrens syndrome after transplantation, highlights that HSCT can induce adoptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> or cure coincidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Donor selection and attentive monitoring is required in such circumstances </plain></SENT>
