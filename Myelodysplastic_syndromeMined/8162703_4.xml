<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since classical MHC genes map on chromosome 6, this assignment indicates that besides duplication of the putative common ancestor gene, transposition events to different chromosomes have also been involved in the evolutionary diversification of this gene family </plain></SENT>
