<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eltrombopag (Revolade, GlaxoSmithKline) is a synthetic non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of endogenous receptors for thrombopoietin, a platelet growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation of eltrombopag in this setting is mainly based on a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of 114 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelet count rose to at least 50,000/mm3 for five weeks in about one-quarter of patients receiving oral eltrombopag 50 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An indirect comparison providing weak evidence suggests that romiplostim is more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials did not provide evidence that either drug reduced the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The haematological risks associated with eltrombopag are poorly evaluated, and mainly include: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e>, and aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cannot be ruled out in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hepatic disorders</z:e> such as photosensitisation are frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> requires further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a high risk of pharmacokinetic interactions through a variety of mechanisms, including enzyme competition and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> binding, but this risk is not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eltrombopag is administered orally, making it more convenient than romiplostim, which necessitates weekly subcutaneous injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In practice, when standard treatments fail in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, it is better to use romiplostim, which appears to be somewhat more effective than eltrombopag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eltrombopag also seems to carry a higher risk of non-haematological adverse effects and drug interactions </plain></SENT>
