<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and immunoregulatory cytokines are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This work was aimed to investigate anti-erythroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in unstimulated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures of 26 patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), and to relate its presence with apoptotic markers and cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cytokine production in culture supernatants, and caspase-3 and nuclear factor-kappaB activity in cell extracts were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of the 26 (53.8%) patients showed the presence of autoantibodies in bone marrow cultures, whereas none displayed a positive direct antiglobulin test in peripheral blood cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of culture supernatants from positive patients with autologous CD45- enriched-cell suspensions showed that the autoimmune reaction was directed against autologous erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had mild signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and increased numbers of erythroblasts, compared with negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with anti-erythroblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> displayed higher caspase-3 activity and lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and interleukin-4 production than did negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> against erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This evidence might support a more rationale use of steroid therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lower levels of cytokines in patients with anti-erythroblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> are consistent with the suggested hypothesis that the autoimmune phenomena observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are probably initiated and perpetuated through alterations of pro-inflammatory and/or immunoregulatory cytokine production </plain></SENT>
