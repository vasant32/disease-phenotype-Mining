<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (M4 in FAB classification) refractory to various kinds of intensive chemotherapy was intravenously administered low doses (7 or 14 mg/m2) of aclacinomycin-A (ACM-A) daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increased mature neutrophils and monocytes and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pelger Huet-like nuclear anomaly, observed in the neutrophils, suggested the leukemic nature of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vivo findings were clearly correlated with the in vitro results in which ACM-A could induce myelomonocytic differentiation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the course of the treatment, the patient achieved and maintained good general condition for more than nine months after the initiation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials, nine patients, five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), were treated with low doses of ACM-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, responded to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that low doses of ACM-A may induce in vivo differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, and may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
