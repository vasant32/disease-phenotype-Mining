<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this process has been extensively studied in mice, its characterization in humans is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By examining the dynamic changes of expression of membrane proteins during in vitro human terminal erythroid differentiation, we identified band 3 and α4 integrin as optimal surface markers for isolating 5 morphologically distinct populations at successive developmental stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis revealed that these purified cell populations have distinct mitotic capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of band 3 and α4 integrin enabled us to isolate erythroblasts at specific developmental stages from primary human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of erythroblasts at successive stages followed the predicted 1:2:4:8:16 pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bone marrows from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients exhibited altered terminal erythroid differentiation profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings not only provide new insights into the genesis of the red cell membrane during human terminal erythroid differentiation but also offer a means of isolating and quantifying each developmental stage during terminal erythropoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings should facilitate a comprehensive cellular and molecular characterization of each specific developmental stage of human erythroblasts and should provide a powerful means of identifying stage-specific defects in diseases associated with pathological erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
