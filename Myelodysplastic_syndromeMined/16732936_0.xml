<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromosomal karyotypes in seventy-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' were analyzed quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the number of abnormal metaphase in 20 counted metaphases, the patients were divided into three groups: no abnormal karyotypes, abnormal metaphases less than or equal to five, and that more than five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate and survival time between these three groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four cases (62.0%) had abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidences of abnormal karyotypes in RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> were 76.9%, 55.8% and 75.0%, respectively, being no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the abnormal karyotypes, complex abnormality with two or more abnormal karyotypes was most common and accounted for 47.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and del 20q were 18.2%, 4.5% and 4.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other kinds of abnormal karyotypes totally accounted for 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 27 cases of group 1, 28 of group 2 and 16 of group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases (25.4%) transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation in group 1, 2 and 3 were 18.5%, 25% and 37.5%, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were 29.6%, 42.9% and 56.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival times were 60, 47 and 24 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The quantitative chromosome abnormality has prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
