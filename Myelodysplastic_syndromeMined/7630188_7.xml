<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two genes involved in the t(8;21) have been recently isolated and the cDNA of the AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> fusion gene identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed the clinical and laboratory features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(8;21) was only found in a subset of M2, which had the clinical and hematological features distinct from those M2 without t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>M2 with t(8;21) was associated with a significantly higher myeloid differentiation and with a good response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, among the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) the t(8;21) was also significantly associated with a higher myeloid differentiation and a good response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M2 patients with t(8;21) could be distinguished on a number of hematological parameters, eg white blood cell count and percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts and promyelocytes, from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> carrying the t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings we suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients carrying t(8;21) can be grouped into two types; overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (M2) and smoldering or slowly evolving myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
