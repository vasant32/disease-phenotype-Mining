<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that each of the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has a specific and different plasma profile of UPS protein and enzymatic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While high levels of proteasome and ubiquitin proteins and enzymatic activities are detected in the plasma samples from patients, normalizing enzymatic activities, show that each proteasome has lower enzymatic activities in these diseases as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteasome protein levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are strong predictor of survival independently of cytogenetics, performance status and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ch-L activity when normalized to the level of proteasome protein show significant negative correlation with survival in ALL </plain></SENT>
