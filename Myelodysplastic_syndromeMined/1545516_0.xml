<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and transplanted with bone marrow cells from an HLA identical sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) and short term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) was given for prophylaxis against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GvHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> value was observed to increase to 6.3 mEq/l during the period of CyA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> value returned to 4 mEq/l when CyA treatment was decreased to a serum concentration of less than 50 ng/ml (FPIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 90 post transplantation the patient was diagnosed as relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was preconditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation and a second bone marrow transplantation was performed using cells from the same donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was treated again with CyA and short term MTX for the prevention of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once again the patient became hyperkalemic with 6.8 mEq/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level was 0.9 mg/dl, the GFR was 52.1 ml/min, FEK was 7.1% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To investigate this possibility a renin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> stimulation test was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that an idiosyncratic response to CyA resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0008242'>pseudohypoaldosteronism</z:hpo> and produced a defect in <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
