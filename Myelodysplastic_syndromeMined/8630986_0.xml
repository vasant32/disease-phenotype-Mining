<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 96 men and 47 women, with a mean age of 63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients were 63 years old and above, and 57 patients were younger than 63 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of the five FAB subtypes were comparable in both groups of patients, except for a higher percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of cytogenetic abnormalities were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the younger patients tended to have a higher frequency of involvement of chromosomes 5 or 7 than the elderly patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implications of our findings in relation to the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
