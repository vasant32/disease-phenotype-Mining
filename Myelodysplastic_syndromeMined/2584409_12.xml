<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 17 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts, 11 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>, five refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation and one could not be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard agglutination direct antiglobulin tests showed that the red cells were most often coated with IgG and C3d, though increased amounts of IgM or IgA were also found in 15 of 35 cases (43%) when the more sensitive enzyme linked method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgG antibodies were predominantly of IgG1 subclass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically important autoimmune haemolysis occurred in 15 patients, and was of "warm", "cold," and "mixed" types in seven, four, and four cases, respectively: it is important to recognise its presence in view of the good response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased incidence of erythrocyte autoantibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is thought to be one manifestation of disturbed immune homeostasis </plain></SENT>
