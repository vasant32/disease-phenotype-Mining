<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in ET patients treated in our hospital during May 1980 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty eight patients (201 males and 237 females with a median age of 48 years) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 101 cases (23.1%), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 86 cases (19.6%), and both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 13 cases (3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>Splenomegaly</z:hpo> occurred in 150 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> occurred in 60 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-nine cases (34%) had no symptoms at diagnosis and 145 cases (33.1%) confirmed by routine blood tests due to other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median platelet count at diagnosis was 1000 x 10(9)/L [(533 -3740) x 10(9)/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 255 cases which showed mainly increase of enlarged mature megakaryocytes with hyper-lobulated nuclei and local proliferation of reticular fiber was revealed in 51 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 90(78.9%) of 114 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was performed in 180 cases and 6 (3.3%) had clonal chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and sixty-one patients were followed up over 12 months with a median of 60 months (range from 12 to 300 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases (6.5%) evolved into marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (MF) and one case into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One case evolved into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> 6 years and then MF 20 years after diagnosis of ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three cases developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> monocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (M5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ET is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> characterized predominantly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The percentage of asymptomatic cases is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The prognoses for most cases were good with a few cases may evolve into MF </plain></SENT>
