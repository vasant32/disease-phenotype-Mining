<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to determine DNA mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> encoded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-oxidase I and II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) biopsy and aspirate, peripheral blood (PB) and buccal smear samples were collected from 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and 10 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi>-oxidase I (CO I) and II (CO II) genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CO I mutations were found in 13/20 MDS patients and the CO II gene in 2/10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 12/20 MDS samples, irrespective of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations were substitutional, deletional and insertional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CO I mutations were most common at nucleotide positions 7264 (25%) and 7289 (15%), and CO II mutations were most common at nucleotide positions 7595 (40%) and 7594 (30%), suggesting the presence of potential 'hot-spots' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations were not found in buccal smears of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples compared with age-matched controls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell fractions (P &lt; 0.05), with bone marrow high-density fraction (BMHDF) showing a higher mutation rate than other fractions (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows showed higher levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BMHDF was directly related to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-oxidase I gene mutations (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> haematopoietic lineages with highly abnormal, iron-laden mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for mt-DNA mutations in the excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and resulting cytopenias of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
