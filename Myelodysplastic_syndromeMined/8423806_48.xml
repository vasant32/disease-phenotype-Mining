<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proto-oncogenes c-jun, junB, junD, and c-fos recently have been shown to encode for transcription factors with a leucine zipper that mediates dimerization to constitute active transcription factors; juns were shown to dimerize with each other and with c-fos, whereas fos was shown to dimerize only with juns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After birth, hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage, and some other terminally differentiated cell types, express high levels of c-fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Still, the role of fos/jun transcription factors in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myelopoiesis or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, c-jun, junB, and junD were identified as myeloid differentiation primary response genes stably expressed following induction of terminal differentiation of myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> M1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, c-fos, though induced during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myelopoiesis, was not induced upon M1 differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To gain further insights into the role of fos/jun in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myelopoiesis and leukemogenicity, M1fos and M1junB cell lines, which constitutively express c-fos and junB, respectively, were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was shown that enforced expression of c-fos, and to a lesser extent junB, in M1 cells results in both an increased propensity to differentiate and a reduction in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of the M1 leukemic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>M1fos cells constitutively expressed immediate-early and late genetic markers of differentiated M1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vitro differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloblasts into mature macrophages and granulocytes, as well as the increased propensity of M1fos leukemic myeloblasts to be induced for terminal differentiation, was dramatically impaired with use of c-fos antisense oligomers in the culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations show that the proto-oncogenes which encode for fos/jun transcription factors play important roles in promoting myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability of the M1 leukemic myeloblasts to be induced for terminal differentiation in the absence of apparent fos expression indicates that there is some redundancy among the fos/jun family of transcription factors in promoting myeloid differentiation; however, juns alone cannot completely compensate for the lack of fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, genetic lesions affecting fos/jun expression may play a role in the development of "preleukemic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and their further progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
