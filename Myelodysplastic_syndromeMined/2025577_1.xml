<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 (Il-1) and Interleukin-6 (Il-6) have been reported to enhance the growth factor dependent colony formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primitive haematopoietic progenitor cells as well as of leukaemic blast-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of Il-1 beta and Il-6 in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on the in vitro colony formation of myeloid progenitors from 23 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither Il-1 beta nor Il-6 were found to have colony stimulating activity on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cultures, either stimulated with optimal or suboptimal doses of GM-CSF, no enhancing or antagonistic effect of Il-6 or Il-1 beta was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, however, an enhancing effect of Il-6 and Il-1 beta in combination with GM-CSF was observed (20/23 and 10/21 cases respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three cases of the Il-6 and GM-CSF combination an antagonistic effect was observed as well as in four cases of the Il-1 beta and GM-CSF combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A delayed addition of Il-6 to the cultures did not result in an abrogation of the effect, indicating that Il-6 is not required immediately at the initiation of the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that costimulation with Il-6 or Il-1 beta is able to augment the GM-CSF activity on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> myeloid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
