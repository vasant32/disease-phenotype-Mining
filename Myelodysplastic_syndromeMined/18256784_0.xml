<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used in combination with immunochemistry/immuno-magnetic bead sorting to investigate the penetration of chromosomal abnormalities into dysplastic hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with documented chromosome abnormalities in the bone marrow at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typical granulocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined as granulocytes with bilobed pseudo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865271" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pelger-Huet anomaly</z:e>, erythrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as tri-nucleus or nuclear budding erythrocytes (21 patients were investigated, respectively) and megakaryocytes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as lymphocytic appearance megakaryocytes (14 patients were investigated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When data were analyzed as a whole, the mean percentage of clonal cells with typical dysplasis was always lower than clonal cell percentage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells no matter whether in granulocytes, erythrocytes or megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each individual case, the situation was the same with just few exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosome ploidy of micro-megakaryocytes was obviously reduced when compared to reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our research suggested that tri-lineage morphological dyshematopoiesis is secondum alteration not a specific feature (imagery) of the abnormal chromosomal clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
