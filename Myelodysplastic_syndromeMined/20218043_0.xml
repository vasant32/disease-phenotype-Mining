<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several variables can complicate testing in the postreaction period and obscure an accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> who was noted to have a febrile response to a unit of red blood cells (RBCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing of the posttransfusion specimen raised concerns for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e> when the patient's RBCs demonstrated a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and the plasma showed incompatibility with the donor RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation revealed that: (1) antibiotic treatment induced a "false" positive DAT in the patient, and (2) donor RBCs were coated with an autoantibody causing them to appear incompatible during postreaction testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, if donor and recipient incompatibility is encountered during a transfusion reaction evaluation, testing of donor RBCs may help resolve issues of serological incompatibility </plain></SENT>
