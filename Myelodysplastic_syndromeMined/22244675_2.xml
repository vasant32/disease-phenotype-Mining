<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) on the quality of life (QOL) of those living with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> participated in five focus groups conducted throughout the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcripts from recordings of focus group sessions were coded and emerging themes identified using thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings revealed a multifaceted description of how <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> affects QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was found to cause a substantial and sustained decrease in ability to function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QOL was adversely affected by work expended on managing the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The emotional impact was often viewed as more problematic than the physical impact; emotional reactions included shock, anger, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, spiritual well-being was often enhanced, with a renewed appreciation for life, relationships, and faith </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has a substantial, often negative impact on patients' lives and clinicians should be cognizant of this impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Attention must be directed at providing more comprehensive support for the patient throughout the illness trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The method of subject recruitment may have limited participation to individuals who are more proactive in obtaining information about their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The focus groups convened only once; thus, purposive sampling and repeated assessments were not possible </plain></SENT>
