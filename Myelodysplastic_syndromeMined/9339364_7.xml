<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with specific hematological features and a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using molecular mapping techniques, we have previously defined the critical region of gene loss of the 5q- chromosome in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> as the approximately 5-Mb region at 5q31-q33 flanked by the genes for FGF1 and IL12B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This region is completely represented by a series of overlapping YACs, and we are currently generating a transcription map with the aim of identifying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene associated with the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study two techniques have been used: first, the screening of full-length cDNA libraries with radiolabeled YACs and second, the mapping of chromosome 5-specific expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to a YAC contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 1-Mb YAC contig encompassing the CSF1R gene has been used to screen a fetal brain cDNA library, and this has resulted in the identification of two genes comprising one known gene previously localized to the region (ADRB2) and one known gene previously unlocalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 135 chromosome 5-specific ESTs were localized by PCR screening to the YAC contig mapping to the critical region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMAGE cDNA clones for each of the six ESTs have been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These seven (excluding ADRB2) newly assigned cDNA clones were subjected to further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns of each of the cDNA clones have been established in a range of human tissues, including bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of seven cDNAs are expressed in human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six of seven cDNAs have no known homology to any deposited human sequences, and one (C29) is dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-3, a member of a novel gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genomic localization and expression patterns would suggest that these newly assigned cDNAs represent potential candidate genes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
