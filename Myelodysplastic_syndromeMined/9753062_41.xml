<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients with cytopenia have a haematological response to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three ATG responders and two non-responders with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were further studied for lymphocyte-mediated inhibition of bone marrow using a standard CFU-GM assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In responders, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) added at a 5:1 ratio suppressed CFU-GM by 54+/-9% (P=0.04) and was reversed by ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment marrow depleted of CD3 lymphocytes, increased CFU-GM by 32% (P=0.02) in an ATG responder, but not in a non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD3 lymphocytes from 6-month post-treatment marrow did not inhibit pre-treatment CFU-GM, indicating ATG had affected the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment marrow depleted of CD8 lymphocytes, increased CFU-GM by 60% (P=0.01) and 49% (P=0.03) in two ATG responders, but not in a non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition required cell-cell interaction through MHCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCRVbeta families, analysed by SSCP, changed from clonal to polyclonal in one ATG responder after 6 months, but clones persisted in a non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> who respond to ATG have CD8 T-cell clones that mediate MHCI-restricted suppression of CFU-GM which are replaced by polyclonal T cells that do not suppress CFU-GM after ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
