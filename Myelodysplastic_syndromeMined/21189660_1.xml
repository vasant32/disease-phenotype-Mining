<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, active and tolerable treatments for patients with relapsed or refractory disease are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> alkylator with novel mechanisms of action, is approved in the United States for rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 2 North American multicenter studies with similar design, enrollment, and response criteria were pooled to evaluate safety and durability of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine was administered at 120 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 every 21 days for 6-8 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The studies enrolled 161 patients with a median of 2 previous chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologies included follicular (68%), small lymphocytic (20%), marginal zone (11%), and lymphoplasmacytic (1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients (34.1%) were refractory to their last chemotherapy, 53 (30.1%) were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 76% with 23% complete remissions (CRs) and unconfirmed CR (CRu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 24-27.8 months) and DOR was 10 months (range, 8.3-14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 2 years, 45% and 23% of responders continued to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 127 patients previously treated with alkylators, ORR was 88% (28% CR/CRu) in responsive and 59% (12% CR/CRu) in refractory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> were reported in 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Second malignancies</z:e> occurred in 9 patients (5.6%; 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bendamustine induces durable responses with acceptable long-term safety in rituximab-refractory indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
