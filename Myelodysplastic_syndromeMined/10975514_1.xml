<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PBSCs were collected using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 5 microg/kg per day subcutaneously for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy consisting of melphalan (140 mg/m2 x 1 day), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg per day x 2 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (2 g/d x 7 days), and total body radiation (150 cGy bid x 3 days) followed by peripheral blood stem cell reinfusion (&gt; or = 1.2 x 10(9) mononucleated cells per kg) and GM-CSF support (5 microg/kg per day) and were evaluated for response, survival, and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients, median age 53.4 years, completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean pretransplantation cumulative melphalan dose was 464 +/- 72 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding the 3 patients (8.3%) who failed to engraft, the median times to engraftment and platelet recovery were 10 days (range, 8-39 days) and 17 days (range, 7-67 days), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (11.1%) died of complications related to the regimen (main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome) within the first 100 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (61.1%) achieved complete response (CR), 8 (22.2%) partial response, and 2 (5.5%) no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after achieving CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 36 patients, the probability of overall survival at 5 years was 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 31 months (range, 0.3-81 months) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 42 months (range, 3.4-81 months) in those with CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of overall and disease-free survival at 5 years for the 22 patients who achieved CR were 43.6% and 15.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This high-dose chemotherapy regimen coupled with PBSC rescue is associated with a high CR rate and is capable of inducing long-term survival in a subset of heavily pretreated patients with primary resistant or recurrent MM </plain></SENT>
