<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the data of 2114 patients who received unmanipulated bone marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling donor with a GVHD prophylaxis using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 1843 patients who survived without relapse at 60 days after transplantation, 435 (24%) developed grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 1566 patients who survived without relapse at 150 days after transplantation, 705 (47%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of relapse was significantly lower in patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, but disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly inferior in patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A benefit of 'mild' GVHD was only seen in high-risk patients who developed grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strongest association between GVHD and a decreased incidence of relapse was observed in patients with standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the therapeutic window between decreased relapse and increased transplant-related mortality due to the development of GVHD appeared to be very narrow </plain></SENT>
