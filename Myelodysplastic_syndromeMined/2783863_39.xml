<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized the IL-4 and IL-5 genes to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By in situ hybridization, the IL-4 and IL-5 genes were found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (t-ANLL), who had a del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-4, IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF as well as other genes such as CD14 and EGR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings that each of these genes was deleted in the 5q- chromosome suggest that loss of function of one or more of these genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> associated with a del(5q) </plain></SENT>
