<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since p53 has been implicated in lymphatic and some myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, we sought to address the role of p53 gene mutations within exons 4-9 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a myeloid preleukemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid the potential hazard of using radioactive single-strand conformation analysis (SSCP), we used a nonradioactive SSCP method based on the silver stain of small minigels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cell lines with known point mutations of the p53 gene, aberrant migrating bands were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial dilutions indicated a sensitivity comparable to radioactive methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a common polymorphism within the 4th exon of the p53 gene was easily detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, of 17 primary samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, none harbored a p53 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this nonradioactive method can easily be used to screen for p53-gene mutations, and that p53-gene mutations do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
