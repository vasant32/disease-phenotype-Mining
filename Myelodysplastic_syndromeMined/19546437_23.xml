<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in immunophenotyping of hematopoietic progenitor and maturing cells in dysplastic bone marrow point to a useful role for multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) in the diagnosis and prognostication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In March 2008, representatives from 18 European institutes participated in a European LeukemiaNet (ELN) workshop held in Amsterdam as a first step towards standardization of FCM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consensus was reached regarding standard methods for cell sampling, handling and processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group also defined minimal combinations of antibodies to analyze aberrant immunophenotypes and thus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examples are altered numbers of CD34(+) precursors, aberrant expression of markers on myeloblasts, maturing myeloid cells, monocytes or erythroid precursors and the expression of lineage infidelity markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When applied in practice, aberrant FCM patterns correlate well with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, the subclassification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and prognostic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the group also concluded that despite strong evidence for an impact of FCM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, further (prospective) validation of markers and immunophenotypic patterns are required against control patient groups as well as further standardization in multi-center studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Standardization of FCM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may thus contribute to improved diagnosis and prognostication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in the future </plain></SENT>
