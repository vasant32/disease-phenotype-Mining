<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the intention-to-treat, 17 patients (25%) randomized to the combined decontamination medication and 33 patients (50%) randomized to ciprofloxacin alone developed grades II to IV GVHD (P &lt;.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in patients randomized to ciprofloxacin alone resulted from a more than twofold increased number of patients developing liver or intestinal involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD compared with patients randomized to the combined decontamination medication (P &lt;.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence of the study medication on grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was significant only in recipients of transplants from genotypically HLA-identical sibling donors (n = 80), whereas in recipients of transplants from donors other than HLA-identical siblings (n = 54), grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD frequencies between the study arms were not significantly different </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of cultures with growth of anaerobic bacteria (P &lt;.005) as well as the median concentrations of anaerobic bacteria in the posttransplant period (P &lt;.0001) were higher in patients contracting grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD nor overall survival was significantly different between the two study arms </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that antimicrobial chemotherapy targeted to intestinal anaerobic bacteria in marrow transplant recipients significantly reduces the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and supports the theory that the intestinal anaerobic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> microflora plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD after human marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
