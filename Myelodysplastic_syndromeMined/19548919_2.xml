<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) present with single or multiple lineage cytopenias in peripheral blood despite a hypercellular bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, attributable to ineffective platelet production by dysfunctional megakaryocytes, has been estimated to occur in 40-65% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are hardly any studies on the clinical relevance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 2900 patients in the Duesseldorf <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registry who were diagnosed at our laboratory between 1982 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 43% of the patients had a platelet count lower than 100 000/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelets were lower than 20 000/microL in 7% of the patients, especially in those with advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, who showed a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and platelet transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, platelet anisometry, hypocellularity of megakaryopoiesis, maturational defects of megakaryocytes and platelets &lt;20 000/microL were independent variables showing a statistically significant correlation (P &lt; 0.05) with clinical signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelets lower than 100 000/microL were associated with significantly shortened survival (P &lt; 0.00005), because of an increased risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (30% vs. 21%) (P &lt; 0.02) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (16% vs. 8%) (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is a strong predictor of short survival, with or without haemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
