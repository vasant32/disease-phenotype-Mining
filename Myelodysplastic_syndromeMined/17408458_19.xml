<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study correlated chromosomal defects with French-American-British (FAB)/World Health Organization (WHO) classification subtypes, proposed a revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic grouping; and established which classification, when used with the IPSS cytogenetic categories, best predicted clinical outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A higher prevalence of chromosomal defects and distinct defects were observed in patients with multi-lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and a blast cell percentage &gt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 3, del(7)(q31q35), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, del(11)(q14q23), del(12p) and 20q- could be segregated from their respective IPSS cytogenetic categories and used to develop new cytogenetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters, FAB/WHO classification, IPSS score and standard or revised cytogenetic categories were statistically relevant for overall survival (OS) and progression-free intervals (PFI) and were included within five distinct multivariate models compared by the Akaike Information Criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To predict OS, the best models included age, WHO classification and standard or revised IPSS cytogenetic categories; to predict PFI, the best model included the same variables and revised cytogenetic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (i) the WHO classification was associated with a more homogeneous cytogenetic pattern than the FAB classification, (ii) WHO classification and standard/revised IPSS cytogenetic categories were much more effective than IPSS for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clinical outcome, (iii) revised cytogenetic subgroups predicted PFI more effectively than standard categories </plain></SENT>
