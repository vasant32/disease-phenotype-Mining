<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) gene has been found down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to investigate the methylation status of the CpG island of DDIT3 promoter region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of DDIT3 was detected in 31.8% (21/66) of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between DDIT3 promoter methylation and clinical parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the estimated 50% survival time of the methylated DDIT3 group was shorter than that of unmethylated group (12.0 months vs. 23.0 months), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the hypermethylation of DDIT3 promoter might be one of early events in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
