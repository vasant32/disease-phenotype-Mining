<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor system with dispersionless microfluidics for the direct and label-free detection of a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR-1) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection approach takes advantage of an affinity interaction between sVEGFR-1 and its ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), which is covalently immobilized on the surface of the SPR sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of the immobilized VEGF-A to specifically bind the sVEGFR-1 receptor is demonstrated in a buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of sVEGFR-1 in 2% human blood plasma is carried out by using the sequential injection approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection limit of 25 ng/mL is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that the functional surface of the sensor can be regenerated for repeated use </plain></SENT>
