<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the elderly, effective treatment of individuals in its advanced stages is problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA microarray analysis is a potentially informative approach to the development of new treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a simple comparison of 'transcriptomes' of bone marrow mononuclear cells among individuals at distinct stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> would result in the identification of genes whose expression differences only reflect differences in the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts within bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a 'population shift' effect has now been avoided by purification of haematopoietic stem-like cells that are positive for the cell surface marker AC133 from the bone marrow of healthy volunteers and 30 patients at various stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis with the AC133+ cells from these individuals resulted in the identification of sets of genes with expression that was specific to either indolent or advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The former group of genes included that for PIASy, which catalyses protein modification with the ubiquitin-like molecule SUMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of PIASy expression in a mouse myeloid cell line induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A loss of PIASy expression may therefore contribute directly to the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> blasts and stage progression </plain></SENT>
