<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two previous reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, primarily involving the lung and skin, have been described in patients with 5q minus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cluster of closely linked genes encoding for cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-3 are present on chromosome 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, cytokine imbalances associated with the deletion of these cytokine genes have been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, an occurrence of epithelioid granulomas within a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, in preexisting clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient, in the current study, had long standing 5q minus deletion, clinically characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> associated with hypolobated megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the patient's history was negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> and the extensive nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas were confined within <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to the absence of Th-2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5, in a subset of 5q minus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, proinflammatory Th-1 cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α may be exaggerated in an environment conducive to antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, we propose a greater susceptibility for the development of granulomas, at least in a subset of patients with 5q minus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
