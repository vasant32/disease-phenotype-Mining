<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the influence of various prognostic factors and examined the outcome in 128 such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> followed by autologous hematopoietic rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients have been observed between 50-130 months (median 77 months) following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at four years is estimated as 45 percent, and failure-free survival as 25 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best results were seen in patients with a good performance status, who had failed at most one prior chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure-free survival at four years is estimated as 53 percent for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapses more than 24 months after transplantation were seen in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients became pregnant after the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged failure-free survival may be observed following high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic rescue in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Superior results were seen in patients without extensive prior chemotherapy and in those with a good performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late relapses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> mandate prolonged follow-up after autologous transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
