<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the procedure used for the nucleolar visualization, early stages of the granulopoietic compartment and particularly myeloblasts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients were characterized by reduction of the nucleolar number expressed by the nucleolar coefficient the values of which resembled those described previously in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reduced values of the nucleolar coefficient of these cells in silver stained specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients were accompanied by a decreased number of clusters of silver stained particles representing interphasic silver stained nucleolus organizer regions (AgNORs) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the differences in the values of the nucleolar coefficient of granulocytic precursors between specimens stained for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and those stained with the silver reaction might reflect changing composition and proportions of nucleolar components in the course of the granulocytic development </plain></SENT>
