<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a clonal disorder, characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis, which can lead to either fatal cytopenias or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk-adapted treatment strategies were established, due to the high median age (60 - 75 years) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and the individual history of the disease (i.e. number of cytopenias, cytogenetic changes, transfusion requirements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation currently offers the only potentially curative treatment, but this form of therapy is not available for the 'typical' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient, who is &gt; 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy with erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has improved the quality of life of selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of target-specific therapies, including antibodies and small molecules directed against specific molecular alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with minimal adverse effects, is the hope for the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the innovative use of immunomodulatory agents and the optimising of cytotoxic treatment should continue to help in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
