<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between August 1997 and October 1998, 12 consecutive adult patients (&gt;18 years) with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (four patients in first early relapse, seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>, and one patient with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> concomitant to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>) were enrolled to receive a single course of HY (100 mg/kg per day) until bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> or for a maximum of 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients, 5 (41.6%) achieved complete remission (CR), 1 achieved partial remission (PR), 4 were resistant to treatment, and 2 died during induction from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> achieved CR, while it was achieved by five of eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> at diagnosis; five of six MDR1+ patients achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As concerns follow-up of the CR patients, one did not receive any further treatment and died in CR from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary aspergillosis</z:e>, and one with a concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) received two courses of FLAG (fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) regimen with disappearance of the clonal Ig rearrangement, but relapsed after 11 months and died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients were consolidated with two courses of high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (AraC), followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of them relapsed after 3 months, while the other two are still in continuous complete remission (CCR) after 16 and 28 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of HHY in inducing CR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the small number of patients, these encouraging results warrant further studies </plain></SENT>
