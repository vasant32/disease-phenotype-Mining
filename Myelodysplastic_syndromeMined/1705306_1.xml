<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF increased significantly the number of myeloid colonies, the best combination being IL-3 + GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the myeloid colony/cluster ratio was also noted, but cytological examination of colony cells showed little maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of myeloid colony surface markers with four monoclonal antibodies (to CD13, CD15, CD33 and CD34) showed minor modifications with an increase of CD13 and CD15 in about one third of cases when compared to control without HGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colonies were obtained in one case with erythropoietin alone, and in 19 cases with the addition of GM-CSF and/or IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In short-term liquid cultures, IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF increased 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that progenitor cells of most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are able to proliferate in the presence of HGF, with wide case-to-case variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the pattern of growth remains abnormal when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF is the most efficient, there is a large overlap in the stimulating effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors studied </plain></SENT>
