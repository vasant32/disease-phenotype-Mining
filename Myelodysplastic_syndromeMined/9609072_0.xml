<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LOCATION: Teaching hospitals: EPM UNIFESP and Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 59 patients diagnosed from 1979 to 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Evaluation of clinical-laboratorial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENT: Statistical comparison, uni and multivariate analysis and actuarial survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cassano's system divided the patients into high and low risk (p = 0.0966) while Sanz's gave high, intermediate and low risk (p = 0.0108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The univariate analysis showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, WBC count, E/M ratio, liver size and blast percentage in BM as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed blast percentage in BM (p = 0.004) and Hb (p = 0.050) as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our system, considering the multivariate analysis data, divided the patients into high, intermediate and low risk (p = 0.0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sanz's system was more functional than Cassano's, while ours showed predictive survival value and ease of use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
