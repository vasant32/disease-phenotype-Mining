<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some cases, follow-up investigations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first 4 months following BMT, mixed chimerism was frequently observed in blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (25%), ALL (30%), NHL (100%) cases and in bone marrow samples of ALL (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence and relative number of a patient's own metaphases found shortly after transplantation was not related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> relapse and probably represents residual non-malignant haematopoietic precursor cells of the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In only one child grafted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with 45,XY, -7 karyotype was the marker clone still detectable in bone marrow at day +437 post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient shows no recurrence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and has a sustained haematological recovery at the time of writing, i.e. 4.5 years post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 other patients, various structural chromosomal abnormalities (not related to the original <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>) were found in both peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three different patients structural anomalies were also found in bone marrow and blood samples from donor-derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that, besides irradiation, there are other as yet unidentified factors (e.g. drugs), which are capable of inducing chromosomal anomalies in the post-BMT period </plain></SENT>
