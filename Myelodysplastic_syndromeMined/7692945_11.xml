<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were shown to contain translocations that involved chromosome 6 in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a large proportion of presumptive del(11)(q23) or del(11)(q23q25) chromosomes may represent previously unidentified translocations that can be detected by FISH </plain></SENT>
