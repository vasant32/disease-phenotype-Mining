<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this paper was to investigate diagnostic and prognostic significance of bone marrow PH features in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and its relation to cytological characteristics of bone marrow aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cellularity, disorder of marrow histotopography, quantity of hematopoiesis lineages, cellular atypia, the amount of myeloblasts, and stromal changes were particularly analyzed in trephines of 236 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In most cases (78.4%) hypercellular bone marrow was observed, although in 10.2% patients hypocellular subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis dislocation was present in 64.7% patients, dislocation of MK-poiesis in 50.9% patients, while 61.3% had dislocation of granulopoesis (so-called ALIP phenomenon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most cases three lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was present, while relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of E- and MK-lineage was found in 1/4 cases, each, particularly in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphological features of dyseritropoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis were present in 42.5% and 75.7% cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different stages of reticulin and collagen <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed in 55.5% patients, while 7.6% had hyperfibrotic subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of cytological and histological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow showed positive correlation between two methods only in respect of estimation of eritropoiesis quantity, presence of dismegakaryocytopoiesis and "reactive" cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The univariate analysis showed that MK- and G-lineage dislocation, quantity of E- and G-lineage, and presence of dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, were prognostic indicators for short survival and evolution of the disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, multivariate analysis showed that only G-lineage dislocation was independent prognostic variable for survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PH analysis is irreplaceable diagnostic procedure during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> investigation, since it provides reliable information of cellularity, architectural disorganization, number of megakaryocytes and alterations of marrow stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, PH analysis provides numerous important prognostic information </plain></SENT>
