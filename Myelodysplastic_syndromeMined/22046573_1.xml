<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsets were assigned using CD45, side scatter, CD34, and CD71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle fractions were analyzed using DRAQ 5 (DNA content) and MPM-2 (mitoses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA damage was assessed using p-H2A.X, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> using Annexin V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients demonstrated no increased mitoses in erythroid, myeloid, or CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myeloid progenitors demonstrated increased G2 cells, which with no increased mitoses suggested delayed passage through G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myeloid progenitors demonstrated increased p-H2A.X, consistent with DNA damage causing this delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annexin V reactivity was equivalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results for each parameter varied among hematopoietic compartments, demonstrating the need to analyze compartments separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that peripheral cytopenias in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are due to delayed cell cycle passage of marrow progenitors and that this delayed passage and leukemic progression derive from excessive DNA damage </plain></SENT>
