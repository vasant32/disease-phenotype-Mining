<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from 17 patients were studied by the semisolid technique, and cells from seven patients by both liquid and semisolid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After incubation in liquid culture with 1,25(OH)2D3, in six of seven patients evaluated an increasing number of myeloid cells (185% to 470%) acquired the morphologic appearance of mature monocyte-macrophages, and a decrease in the number of immature myeloid cells (26% to 75%) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis and killing of Candida albicans by monocyte-macrophages incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and similar to those processes in untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1,25(OH)2D3 increased the percentage of monocytes that phagocytosed C. albicans in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 17 patients showed reduced myeloid cloning, and eight showed increased cluster formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cloning efficiency was significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of 2 X 10(-9) to 2 X 10(-8) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 and 10(-8) to 10(-7) mol/L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> had a stimulatory effect on myeloid colony growth in five of the six patients with sideroblastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, but in only two of the 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
