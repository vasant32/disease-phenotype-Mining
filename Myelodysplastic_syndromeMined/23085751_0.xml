<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reference treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> has been shown to exert antileukemic activity in vitro and in vivo, independent of the EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thanks to this feature, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> is currently being tested as an antileukemic drug in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> mediate synergistic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects in several primary or secondary (post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> blocked cell-cycle progression and induced caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> more consistently than either of the two agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were not a consequence of cellular differentiation and could be discriminated from each other, as the former depended on caspases whereas the latter did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synergy between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi>, which involved the proteasomal degradation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-1 and BCL2L10 and the upregulation of their pro-apoptotic counterpart PUMA, was abolished when azacytidine was replaced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> but persisted when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> was substituted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi>, another EGFR inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, the intracellular accumulation of azacytidine was exacerbated by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi>, pointing to a pharmacokinetic mechanism of synergy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In approximately half of the cases studied, marrow and circulating blasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, respectively, exhibited hyperadditive cytotoxic responses to the combination of azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the combination of azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> may exert clinically relevant antileukemic effects.Oncogene advance online publication, 22 October 2012; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.469 </plain></SENT>
