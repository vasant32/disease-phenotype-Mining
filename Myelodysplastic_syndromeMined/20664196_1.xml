<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Micafungin was administered for sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (&gt;38.4°C) on days 3-5 following the initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate and side effects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate of micafungin was 61.7% (29/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 3 patients (6.4%) experienced grade 3/4 elevations in their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase levels, and 10 patients (21%) experienced grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo>, 9 of which resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients died of septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Younger patients (&lt;50 years) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> exhibited a better response to micafungin than other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients that were less profoundly neutropenic (≥0.05 × 10(9)/l) also had a better response to micafungin, as did the patients who recovered from their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Micafungin has an excellent efficacy (61.7%) and safety profile when used as an empirical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> in febrile neutropenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
