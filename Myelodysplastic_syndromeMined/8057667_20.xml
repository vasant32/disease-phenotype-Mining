<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic findings were correlated with clinical and hematological data in altogether 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) and with inv(3) (13 patients) or t(3;3) (five patients), six of whom were male and 12 who were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal changes in addition to the 3q anomalies were demonstrated in 14 out of 18 patients, predominantly numerical and structural aberrations of chromosome 7 (12 cases) and/or abnormalities of 5q (five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complex karyotype abnormalities were observed in six of 13 patients with inv(3), but in only one of five patients with t(3;3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ten out of our 18 patients a preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and/or exposure to mutagenic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi> had been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight patients the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of ANLL blasts was immature (FAB subtype M1); in three patients ANLL-M4, and in two patients each ANLL-M5, M6, and M7 was diagnosed; in one patient with antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the leukemic blasts were not classifiable according to the FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A disturbed megakaryocyte development, characterized by an excess of micromegakaryocytes was observed in 14 patients, seven of them showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated platelet counts</z:e> as an unusual feature in patients with ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical course and outcome was extremely poor: 15 of 18 patients died within 10 months after the diagnosis of ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of their missing response to conventional chemotherapy, patients with inv(3) or t(3;3) have to be estimated as at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The characterization of genes affected by inv(3) or t(3;3) could help to elucidate molecular changes leading to impaired proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, also of the megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on molecular genetic findings new therapeutical approaches could be designed </plain></SENT>
