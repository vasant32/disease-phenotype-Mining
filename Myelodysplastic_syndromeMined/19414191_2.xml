<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells of CG-SH are immature blasts and have an immature myeloid phenotype (positive for myeloperoxidase, CD7, CD34, CD38, CD117, HLA-DR, negative for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD41, CD42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A partial expression of CD13, CD15, CD65 and a weak expression of CD33 and CD133 was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells are negative for EBER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By molecular analysis, a mutation of NRAS and heterozygous mutations of RUNX1 were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutations were detected in FLT3-ITD, MLL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e> or NPM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By real-time PCR, a series of 19 microRNAs was identified which are strongly expressed in CG-SH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a new cell line was established which will be useful for the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics and mutations in NRAS and/or RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
