<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using FISH and molecular analyses, we have analyzed five different pediatric and adult patients carrying cytogenetic abnormalities involving 12p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that ETV6 was rearranged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, ETV6 was disrupted by translocations with chromosomal bands 7q22, 7q36, 9q11, and 13q12, not previously described as partners of ETV6 in translocations, thus extending its promiscuity in rearranging with different partner genes </plain></SENT>
