<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Transient marrow expansion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell precursors, termed hematogones, is occasionally observed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the clinical significance of this phenomenon, we enumerated hematogones in 108 consecutive patients who received allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematogone quantitation was performed at the time of complete donor engraftment (median day 25 and 32 in patients who received bone marrow and cord blood cell transplants, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematogones were polyclonal B cells, and their frequencies correlated positively with blood B-cell numbers, and inversely with donorsâ€™ but not recipients' age, suggesting that hematogones reflect cell-intrinsic B-cell potential of donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients developing hematogones that comprised &gt; 5% of bone marrow mononuclear cells constituted a group with significantly prolonged overall survival and relapse-free survival, irrespective of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> or donor cell source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with &gt; 5% hematogones developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host diseases</z:e> less frequently, which may contribute toward their improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the amount of hematogones at the time of engraftment may be a useful tool in predicting the prognosis of patients treated with allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: Quantitation of hematogones at engraftment is useful to predict prognosis of patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
