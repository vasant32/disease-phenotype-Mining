<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patient groups showed a reduction of enzyme activity in azurophilic granules, and also of lactoferrin, consistent with abnormal development of neutrophil granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cytochemical changes in blood neutrophils are similar to those found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath>, are consistent with a leukaemic maturation defect, and may be of diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
