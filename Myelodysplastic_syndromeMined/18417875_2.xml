<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ranges of survival were 4-51 months, 40-59 months, 7-38 months, 5-24 months and 5 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients died and 3 showed disease progression during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A composite analysis of proliferative indices, cytogenetics, immunophenotype and other conventional/novel prognostic parameters in the context of Indian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferative indices (AgNOR and Ki 67 positivity), immunophenotypic markers, serum LDH and ferritin levels revealed wide variations and great overlap among different FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scoring systems (Bournemouth, Dusseldorf and Goasguen) did not correlate with the prognosis and survival (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 24/35 (68.57%) patients, +8, -5 and -7 being observed commonly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (88.8%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> (80.0%) and RA (63.6%) subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By Using Mufti's prognostic system and International prognostic scoring system (IPSS), a good positive correlation was found between low risk category and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> with better survival as compared to other risk categories/FAB subtypes (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, rest of the FAB subtypes were assigned into high, intermediate and low risk categories without any correlation with the survival and/or leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> subtype revealed itself as the better prognostic category according to the cytogenetic findings as well as Mufti's grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was possible due to the longer follow up available for these patients (40-59 months) </plain></SENT>
