<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi>) staining for measuring nuclear DNA content in megakaryocytes which have been morphologically identified on the Wright-Giemsa stained smear in 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 12 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Briefly, megakaryocytes morphologically examined on a Wright-Giemsa stained smear were photographed, and were located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then removed the Wright-Giemsa stains by immersing it in 50% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, 37 degrees C for 1 hour and 100% <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>, 37 degrees C for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
