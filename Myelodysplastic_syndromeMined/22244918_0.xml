<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overrepresentation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 and its serologic split HLA-DR15 has been associated with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in certain ethnic groups and has been proposed as a predictive factor for a favorable response to immunomodulatory treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the HLA-DRB1*15 haplotype does not predominate in the Greek population, we investigated the frequency of HLA-DRB1 alleles among 114 patients of Greek origin suffering from various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t), 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 7 hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1 molecular typing was performed with polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotides and results were compared with that from a previously reported control Greek population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1*1602 was the only allele that was significantly overrepresented in Greek <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as a whole, whereas HLA-DRB1*1501 allele frequency was significantly higher in Greek patients with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the possible value of HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR16 as determinants for immunomodulatory interventions, at least for Greek patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
