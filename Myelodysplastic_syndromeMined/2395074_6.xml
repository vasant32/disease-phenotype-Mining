<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have suggested that the pineal hormone <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, in addition to its documented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> action, plays a role in the physiological regulation of blood cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we evaluated the clinical effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out on six patients, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was given orally at a dose of 20 mg/daily, following a schedule prepared to reproduce the circadian rhythm of the pineal hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transient improvement in platelet and neutrophil count was achieved in two of five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and in two of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> before therapy, respectively, while no effect was seen on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean survival time was 12.5 months, and a long survival, greater than 30 months, was achieved in two of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results seem to suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> may have a role in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> induced by previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
