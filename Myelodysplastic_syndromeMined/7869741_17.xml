<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exposure histories of 400 individually matched pairs were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased or possibly increased odds ratios were observed for radiation (2.05, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.76), halogenated organics (1.57, 0.97-2.57), metals (1.40, 0.99-2.00), several specific radiation exposures and individual chemicals and for childlessness (1.46, 1.01-2.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> generally carries a poor prognosis, whether or not individuals convert to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, these findings add to previous reports of exposures implicated in the aetiology of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and add to the case for minimizing exposures to radiation and halogenated organics </plain></SENT>
