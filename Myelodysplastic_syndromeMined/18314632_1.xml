<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes changes in the degree of global methylationlevel in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> during progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation status was analyzed in 127 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 26 reactive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We employed Pyrosequencing, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and a realtime PCR-based quantitative assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected an increase of methylation level of LINE-1 sequences using pyrosequencing and an increase of methylation in the HpaII recognition site employing LUMA during the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation sensitive quantitative PCR showed no statistically significant differences, only a trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LINE-1 and methylation sensitive cleavage of DNA can act as a surrogatmarker for global DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genome wide hypermethylation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a distinct feature of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It discriminates <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and may explains the success of hypomethylation inducing reagents like azadeoxycytidine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
