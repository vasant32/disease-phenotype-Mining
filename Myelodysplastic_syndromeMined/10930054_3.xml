<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Iron excretion was measured in 16 patients participating in studies to test the safety of OL(1)p53, a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were given OL(1)p53 at doses of 0.05 to 0.25 mg/kg/h for 10 days by continuous intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urine was collected during the study and analyzed for iron, copper, <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi>, and zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have a high affinity for iron as well as several other clinically relevant toxic metals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of patient urine following administration of OL(1)p53 reveals a 7.5-fold increase in iron excretion at low doses (0.05 mg/kg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may have therapeutic potential as heavy metal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low doses of phosphorothioate oligonucleotide facilitated the excretion of iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal clearance of iron-phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complexes most likely involves secretion into proximal tubules </plain></SENT>
