<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a multifunctional haematopoietin which can promote production of several blood cell lineages, though the predominant target cells are neutrophils, monocytes, and their precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasional undesirable clinical effects include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, an increase in blasts, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe four patients who were treated with GM-CSF, at subcutaneous doses significantly lower than are conventional, and experienced an unusual response pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and exhibited an unexpected switch in the responsive lineage on high- versus very low-dose therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two CLL patients developed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (up to 10.0 x 10(9) cells/l) without an increase in neutrophils on 125-300 micrograms/m2/d of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when the dose was lowered to 10 micrograms/m2/d, the neutrophils rose to physiological levels, without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient showed a rapid rise in peripheral blasts (baseline level = 0; post-therapy level = 5.0 x 10(9)/l), without a change in other cell types, when receiving 60 micrograms/m2/d of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After GM-CSF was held, blasts returned to baseline levels; reinstituting therapy at the very low dose of 6 micrograms/m2/d was followed by an increase in platelet counts from 50 to 185 x 10(9)/l with only a minor increase in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient, who suffered from severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> complicated by recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage, was only treated with the low-dose regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He showed a predominant platelet effect with counts rising from 9 to 169 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Very low-dose GM-CSF therapy was devoid of constitutional side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The biological implications of these GM-CSF responses are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, in some patients, GM-CSF may stimulate different target cells depending on the dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in contrast to the results of administration of many classical drugs, there may not always be a direct relationship between the amount of GM-CSF given and the optimal effect </plain></SENT>
