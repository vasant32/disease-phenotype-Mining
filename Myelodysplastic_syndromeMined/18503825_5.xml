<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some molecular abnormalities related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) transformation have been reported, such as FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FLT3, a member of the class 3 receptor tyrosine kinase family, mediates stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and its mutations, internal tandem duplication (ITD) and Asp835, have been reported in rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied FLT3 ITD, prospectively, in 50 MDS patients at diagnosis, at 6 and 12 months follow-up, and at any other time-point if <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLT3 ITD was not observed at diagnosis, but during follow-up the mutation was present in 2 of 50 patients (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, one case exhibited FLT3 ITD at the end of the 6 months of follow-up in approximately 8% of bone marrow cells; this case evolved into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at 8 months, at which time FLT3 ITD was present in approximately 85% of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other case exhibited FLT3 ITD in 68% of bone marrow cells at 7 months, precisely at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, FLT3 ITD is associated with a high probability of evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
