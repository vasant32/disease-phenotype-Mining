<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of different types of probes, used as a complement to conventional cytogenetics, revealed that 7 of 148 patients (4.7%) with abnormalities of chromosome 5 had an i(5)(p10), an idic(5)(q11), or a structurally rearranged i(5)(p10) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 5 and its related abnormalities such as idic(5)(q11) and structurally rearranged i(5)(p10) are rare but recurrent abnormalities; their identification requires a combination of conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biological and clinical significance cannot yet be assessed, not only because too few cases have been described but also because these abnormalities are usually part of a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
