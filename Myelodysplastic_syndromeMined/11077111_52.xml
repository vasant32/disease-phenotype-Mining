<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 1982, the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group proposed a classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) based on morphological features in blood and bone marrow, namely on medullary and peripheral blast count, Auer rods, ring sideroblasts and the number of monocytes in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This classification has been used for numerous studies regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, prognosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some details of this morphological classification remained unclear, and some patients were unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A working group of the World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed a new classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, based on a significant modification of the original FAB proposals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> were removed from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> classification and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> was split into two groups with medullary blast counts below and above 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a group of patients with less than 5% medullary blasts but evidence of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with 5q- as the sole chromosomal anomaly were also considered a separate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to validate the new classification with respect to prognostic importance, and to correlate it with cytogenetic and hematological features in a large series of patients (n=1600) with a long-term follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We were able to confirm a significant difference in prognosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB I</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB II</z:e>, as well as a difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with 5q- anomaly had a much better prognosis than other WHO subtypes, but this was only true for patients with a medullary blast count below 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, the WHO classification appears to define morphological subgroups that are more homogeneous with respect to prognosis than the FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
