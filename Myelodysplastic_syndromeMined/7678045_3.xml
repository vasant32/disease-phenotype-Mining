<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical studies included iron stain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>), peroxidase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> esterase, chloroacetate esterase, and double esterase stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical staining was done with monoclonal antibody HP1-1D, which recognizes the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa complex in megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The iron stain remained most helpful in identifying abnormal ringed sideroblasts, a feature of dyserythropoiesis, and thus in supporting the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> stain was helpful, if positive, in identifying patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; however, when it was negative, this stain did not help distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunocytochemical stain with HP1-1D monoclonal antibody was also helpful in identifying atypical micromegakaryocytes, indicative of dysmegakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other cytochemical abnormalities were infrequently observed and were less specific for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of two stains--for example, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> and iron stain or <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> and double esterase--was helpful, however, in excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, inasmuch as neither the miscellaneous nor the control group stained positively with these combinations </plain></SENT>
