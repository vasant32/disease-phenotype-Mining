<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of gene promoter region is responsible for inappropriate gene silencing, and it has been associated to initiation and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant promoter methylation is frequently observed in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), but in pediatric patients it has been poorly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the promoter methylation status of 13 genes in bone marrow cells collected at diagnosis of 21 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (subtype <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this analysis, we performed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment of genomic DNA, followed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples, we observed two genes frequently methylated: CALCA was methylated in 85.7% (18/21) of the analyzed samples and CDKN2B in 50% (6/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CALCA and CDKN2B are frequently methylated in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It suggests that aberrant methylation in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> seems to be similar to adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, thus pediatric patients could be also benefited with treatment using demethylating agents </plain></SENT>
