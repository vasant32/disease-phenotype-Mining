<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The features of restrictive usage and absence of partial T cell clones have been found in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of Ph-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> during treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic change of clonal proliferation of T cell receptor (TCR) Valpha and Vbeta subfamilies in one <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patient who developed Ph-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) after interferon and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples were collected at the 3 time points (diagnosis of Ph-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (CP) <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, developing Ph-negative ALL and post inductive chemotherapy (CT) for Ph-negative ALL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CDR3 size of TCR Valpha and Vbeta repertoire were detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PCR products were further analyzed by genescan to identify T cell clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patient who achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) after 5 years of IFN-alpha therapy suddenly developed Ph-negative ALL 6 months following switch to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern and clonality of TCR Valpha/Vbeta T cells changed in different disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The restrictive expression of Valpha/Vbeta subfamilies could be found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three stages, and partial subfamily of T cells showed clonal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there have been obvious differences in Valpha/Vbeta subfamily of T cells between the stages of Ph-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-CP and Ph-negative ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Valpha10 and Vbeta3 T cells evolved from oligoclonality to polyclonality, the Vbeta13 T cells changed from bioclonality to polyclonality, when Ph-negative ALL developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive usage and clonal proliferation of different Valpha/Vbeta subfamily T cells between the stages of Ph-positive CP and Ph-negative ALL were detected in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These changes may play a role in Ph- negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
