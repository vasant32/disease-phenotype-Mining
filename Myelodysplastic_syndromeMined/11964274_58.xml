<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here an analysis of a cohort of 30 patients with otherwise typical AA in whom clonal karyotypic evolution was observed during frequent periodic marrow examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The actuarial risk for this complication has been estimated in other studies at around 15% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversion from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to abnormal karyotype occurred at a constant rate after initial diagnosis, with about 50% of cases developing within the first 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient chromosomal abnormalities were infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, AA patients with clonal cytogenetic patterns were heterogenous; a variety of karyotypic defects with numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosome 7 accounted for 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, structural and numerical abnormalities of chromosome 13, deletion of Y chromosome, and complex cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, aberrancies of chromosome 5 and 20 were infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical course depended on the specific abnormal cytogenetic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to leukemic transformation occurred in patients with abnormalities of chromosome 7 or complex cytogenetic alterations or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evolution of chromosome 7 abnormalities was seen most often in refractory patients who had failed to respond to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 developed in patients with good hematologic responses who often required <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA), and survival was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although AA patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 showed a similar prognosis to those with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in AA appears to have a more favorable prognosis than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
