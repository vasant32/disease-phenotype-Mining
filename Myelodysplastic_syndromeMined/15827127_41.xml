<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 is a frequent cytogenetic abnormality in bone marrow cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and its presence has been associated anecdotally with good response to immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 34 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in bone marrow cells, some of whom were undergoing treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had significant CD8+ T-cell expansions of one or more T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta subfamilies, as measured by flow cytometry; expanded subfamilies showed CDR3 skewing by spectratyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sorted T cells of the expanded Vbeta subfamilies, but not of the remaining subfamilies, inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cell growth in short-term hematopoietic culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The negative effects of Vbeta-expanded T cells were inhibited by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and Fas <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and required direct cell-to-cell contact </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased number of T cells with apparent specificity for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cells is consistent with an autoimmune pathophysiology in <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 MDS </plain></SENT>
