<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One-third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) progress to secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML), with its concomitant poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, multiple mutations have been identified in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-to-sAMLtransition, but it is still unclear whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these mutations are necessary for transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If multiple independent mutations are required for the transformation, sAML risk should increase with time from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, if a single critical biological event determines sAML transformation; its risk should be constant in time elapsing from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this question, we studied a database of 1079 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We classified patients according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), using either the French-American-British (FAB) or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and statistically analyzed the resulting transformation risk curves of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of transformation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis remained constant in time within three out of four risk groups, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four risk groups, when patients were classified according to FAB or to the WHO-determined criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further subdivision by blast percentage or cytogenetics had no influence on this result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that a single random biological event leads to transformation to sAML, thus calling for the exclusion of time since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis from the clinical decision-making process </plain></SENT>
