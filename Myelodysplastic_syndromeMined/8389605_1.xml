<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MPO activity in neutrophil granulocytes from the same case was found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MPO deficiency in monocytes appeared to be associated with impaired phagocytic capacity and, based on the results of immunophenotypic and ultrastructural studies, was most likely attributable to a partial maturation arrest of monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that MPO deficiency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may have its origin in a number of different pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
