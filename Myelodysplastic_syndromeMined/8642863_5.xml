<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and KL receptor (c-kit) expression in 15 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of bone marrow cells expressing the EPO-R from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No apparent correlation was found between the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells coexpressing the EPO-R and CD34 and impaired erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-kit was expressed in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, including those not responding to KL in EPO-induced cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases the different splice variants of the EPO-R were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, expressed the full length EPO-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that impaired erythroid response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cannot be explained by a quantitative lack of receptors for EPO or KL and that most likely suppression of erythroid response is caused by defective receptor signalling following ligand binding, representing a functional defect within the receptor itself or at a level downstream of the receptor </plain></SENT>
