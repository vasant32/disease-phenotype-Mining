<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>) are a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> that manifest dysplastic hematopoiesis and usually a hypercellular bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ineffective hematopoiesis leads to haematologic failure in these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are a rare event during pregnancy although the exact incidence is unknown it is likely to be less than that for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL REPORT: The case, a 29 year old woman, presented during 23rd week of her first, triplet, pregnancy with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The pathogenetic aspect and diagnostic management is discussed, underlined especially under the point of view of the triplet pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> during pregnancy is coincidental and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolves in a majority of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004861'>refractory macrocytic anemias</z:hpo> in pregnancy need to be carefully evaluated for a primary myelodysplastic state </plain></SENT>
