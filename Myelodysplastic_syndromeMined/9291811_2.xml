<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data files from the incidence years 1989-1992 of the two registries were linked in order to evaluate accuracy and completeness and to calculate and equalise the incidence rates for childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlinked records or records with disagreements (birth date, sex, type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and incidence date) were checked by the DCLSG and by the regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DCLSG recorded 431 cases of childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, while the NCR recorded 434 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After record linkage and review of the cases, it was concluded the 445 records should have been recorded as childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NCR had recorded 425 of the 445 correct cases (95.5%), but had missed 20 cases (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DCLSG had recorded 431 of the 445 correct cases (96.9%) and had missed 14 cases (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the NCR had recorded 9 cases incorrectly as childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Part of the disagreement was caused by differences in coding rules (definition of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could be concluded that the quality and completeness of the two registries was very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regular comparison of the recorded data will help to reveal the inherently problematic disagreement between definitions and coding </plain></SENT>
