<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine (68%) are alive and probability of survival at 14 years, according to Kaplan and Meier, is 62% +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients developed a late clonal complication: 11 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>); two patients had both </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of being alive at 14 years is 81% +/- 10% for patients with stable disease and 36% +/- 13% for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To look for predictive signs, we reevaluated peripheral blood and bone marrow cytomorphology at presentation, during regeneration, and in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined the peripheral blood values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, reticulocytes, granulocytes, thrombocytes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, as well as bone marrow for cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ALG therapy induces slow and incomplete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although in "remission," ALG patients have lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values, higher reticulocyte counts, lower granulocyte and platelet values, and a higher MCV and fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They retain a <z:mp ids='MP_0008255'>reduced number of megakaryocytes</z:mp> and a persistence of atypical monocytes in bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> as stigmata of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with late clonal complications show distinct morphologic abnormalities: patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> have higher MCVs, higher granulocyte and reticulocyte counts, and more dyserythropoiesis at diagnosis and a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> with an increased proportion of erythroblasts in the bone marrow in "remission." Patients who later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are not different from the total patient population at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After therapy, these patients are characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts and atypical monocytes during regeneration and by a persistent increase in MCV, a higher fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, lower granulocyte values, and megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during "remission." Thus, routine morphologic follow-up examination of blood and bone marrow can discover patients at risk for late hematologic complications after ALG therapy </plain></SENT>
