<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its activation by chromosomal rearrangement induces a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, retroviral insertion-mediated upregulation confers a competitive advantage to transplanted hematopoietic cells, triggering clonal dominance or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the molecular and functional response of primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells to the activation of Evi1, we established an inducible lentiviral expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVI1 had a biphasic effect with initial growth inhibition and retarded myeloid differentiation linked to enhanced survival of myeloblasts in long-term cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that within 24â€‰h EVI1 upregulated 'stemness' genes characteristic for long-term hematopoietic stem cells (Aldh1a1, Abca1, Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c, Epcam, among others) but downregulated genes involved in DNA replication (Cyclins and their kinases, among others) and DNA repair (including Brca1, Brca2, Rad51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis demonstrated EVI1's anti-proliferative effect to be strictly dose-dependent with accumulation of cells in G0/G1, but preservation of a small fraction of long-term proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although confined to cultured cells, our study contributes to new hypotheses addressing the mechanisms and molecular targets involved in preleukemic clonal dominance or leukemic transformation by Evi1 </plain></SENT>
