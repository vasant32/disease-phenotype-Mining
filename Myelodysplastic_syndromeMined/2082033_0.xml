<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean nuclear size (N), mean cytoplasmic size (C) and mean N/C ratio were 586 +/- 105 mu 2, 1,391 +/- 327 mu 2 and 0.42 +/- 0.04, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell sizes were found to be reduced in 12 patients compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atypical megakaryocytes were frequently found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and micromegakaryocytes were also often found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean platelet volume was 0.9 +/- 1.6 fl and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001902'>giant platelets</z:hpo> were seen in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with presence of more than 10% of atypical megakaryocytes, template Ivy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolonged and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>- and collagen-induced aggregation decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that reduction of megakaryocytes' size and appearance of micromegakryocytes would be helpful in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
