<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study, 12 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (nine transfusion-dependent) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) to assess the therapeutic effect on erythropoiesis and on transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with a low risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> were included, i.e. refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), providing the percentage of myeloblasts in the bone marrow did not exceed 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant HuEpo treatment was initiated at a dose of 50 units/kg body weight and administered subcutaneously three times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3-week intervals the dose was increased with 50 units/kg per injection, until after 15 weeks a maximum dose of 250 units/kg three times weekly was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant HuEpo was well tolerated and no serious side effects were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of the emergence of a new malignant clone in response to rHuEpo as shown by sequential karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients was an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level or a diminished red blood cell transfusion requirement seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four out of 10 evaluable sequential bone marrow smears, an increase in erythropoiesis was seen, suggesting stimulation of ineffective red cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of these patients also showed a rise in reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-E) in blood and bone marrow was not affected by rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also no change in the number of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in blood and bone marrow was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, subcutaneous treatment with rHuEpo at dosages up to 250 units/kg body weight (three times weekly) fails to increase the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level or to diminish the transfusion requirement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether higher doses of rHuEpo are effective or whether patients with less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> who are transfusion independent, have a higher likelihood of response </plain></SENT>
