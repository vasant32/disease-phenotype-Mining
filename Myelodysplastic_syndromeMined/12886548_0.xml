<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is featured by cytopenia in one or more cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently the only possible treatment was supportive care with transfusions and antibiotics, but new options have now become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article the results of immunosuppressive treatment are described and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present seven patients who were treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with ATG are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the seven patients treated with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> achieved a complete response, one had a partial response and one had a minor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> an acquired insult to the hemopoietic stem cell leads to impaired differentiation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathophysiology suggests that transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells induces an autoimmune T cell response with the bone marrow as the target organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This autoimmune attack results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> overproduction of pro-apoptotic cytokines, especially TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to a dysplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the mechanism of action of ATG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may involve elimination of CD8+ lymphocyte mediated suppression of granulocyte/monocyte progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
