<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 23% of the participants (n = 75) in the longitudinal sample had Z-scores on at least one of the neuropsychological tests that were &lt;1.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants in the study showed improvement over baseline at the 12 and 18 months assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average Z-scores for the six cognitive domains in the longitudinal data set over the course of the study ranged from -0.89 to 0.59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of change in neuropsychological test scores included age, with older participants showing less improvement over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other predictors included baseline cognitive domains (language, memory, and attention), previous cocaine use, disease status, intelligence quotient, and quality of life measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings support previous studies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> who showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> at baseline prior to HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was little evidence for further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> over the course of 18 months </plain></SENT>
