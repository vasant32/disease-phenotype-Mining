<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of TET2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 20 healthy donors was examined by qPCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of TET2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in BMMNC was down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with the donor group [(0.41±0.28)% vs. (1.07±0.56)%] (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with lower expression group (TET2&lt;0.4) [(6.53±6.17)%], patients with higher expression of TET2 (≥0.4) presented significantly lower proportion of bone marrow blasts [(1.21±1.56)%] (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of TET2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in BMMNC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was inversely correlated with malignant clone burden (r=-0.398, P&lt;0.05) and IPSS (r=-0.412, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of TET2 protein was down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with that in the donor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of TET2 in BMMNC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is decreased, which might be useful as an important parameter for the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone burden </plain></SENT>
