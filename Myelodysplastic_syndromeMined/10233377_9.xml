<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have indicated that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the production of erythroid precursors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a clinical trial to evaluate whether the combination of these growth factors was effective in relieving the cytopenias associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31 anaemic patients with low and intermediate-risk primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enrolled in a 12-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy was initiated with GM-CSF at 1 microgram/kg/d.s.c., and then adjusted to either normalize or double the absolute neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPO was given subcutaneously on alternate days starting from day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EPO dose was initiated at 150 U/kg and increased to 300 U/kg if after 6 weeks there was no or suboptimal erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>26 patients completed the study treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluable cases had a neutrophil response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant erythroid responses with increases of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of at least 1 g/dl and/or reduction of transfusion needs were seen in 9/26 (34.6%), five patients improving their response after dose escalation of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment had no apparent effect on mean platelet counts, a single case displaying a trilineage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An elevated bone marrow erythroid infiltration and low concentrations of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha were the only predictors of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> response both in univariate and in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination GM-CSF + EPO can abrogate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and substantially relieve transfusion requirements in a large proportion of patients with low and intermediate risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in vivo synergy between these growth factors for the production of erythroid precursors is not supported by our data </plain></SENT>
