<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-methylation strategy to study the clonal basis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RFLP-methylation analysis was performed on cell populations from bone marrow (BM) aspirates and peripheral blood using probes specific for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Density gradient centrifugation methods were used to separate granulocytes and monocytes, and T lymphocytes were positively selected by CD2 (a pan-T marker) immunoconjugated magnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell populations from BM aspirates in 6 of the 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed a monoclonal pattern of X-inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neutrophilic and T-lymphocytic cell fractions were analyzed in 4 of the 6 patients, and the monocytic cell fraction in one of these, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fractions analyzed showed a similar monoclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 of the latter 4 patients, both of whom had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, DNA from a skin biopsy showed a polyclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a clonal disorder, even in the absence of detectable cytogenetic abnormalities, and that the abnormal clone is capable of myeloid, monocytic, and lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
