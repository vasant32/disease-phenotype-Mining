<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality in the disease results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> or transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are frequent cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletions of chromosomes 5, 7, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurring chromosomal translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> are rare, but the most frequent are the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and the inv(3)(q21q26), which lead to the inappropriate activation of the EVI1 gene located at 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of EVI1 in this disease, we have generated a murine model of EVI1-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> by BM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that EVI1 induces a fatal disease of several stages that is characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease does not progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of in vitro and in vivo results suggests that EVI1 acts at two levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immediate effects of EVI1 are hyperproliferation of BM cells and downregulation of EpoR and c-Mpl, which are important for terminal erythroid differentiation and platelet formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These defects are not fatal, and the mice survive for about 10 months with compensated hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over this time, compensation fails, and the mice succumb to fatal peripheral cytopenia </plain></SENT>
