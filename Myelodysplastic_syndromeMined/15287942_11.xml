<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After treatment, responsive patients presented a significantly lower proportion of FISH abnormal CD34(+) cells than before treatment (P = 0.003), and in comparison with unresponsive cases (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was associated with a reduced degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD34(+) cells (P = 0.021): however, no difference in telomere length was observed in responsive patients after growth factor administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the number of patients analysed was relatively small, the present data suggest that, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, response to rHuEpo and G-CSF may be related to the proliferation of karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but potentially defective CD34(+) progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
