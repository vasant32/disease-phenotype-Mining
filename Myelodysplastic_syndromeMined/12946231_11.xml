<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) has historically relied on combining clinical information with the morphologic features of the peripheral blood and bone marrow to reach a final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective evidence of a myeloid stem cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in the form of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality is provided in only 30% to 40% of the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e> (non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e>) and in a similar percentage of the MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns of antigen expression during myeloid maturation and to determine whether flow cytometric evaluation of myeloid maturation represents an additional objective way to assess the likelihood of a stem cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated 4-color flow cytometry data from more than 400 bone marrow aspirates obtained since 1998 from patients suspected of having a non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> or an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reproducible patterns of antigen expression were seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid maturation as well as in benign reactive settings such as marrow regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we summarize data, presented in detail elsewhere, from a retrospective comparison of the sensitivity of flow cytometry with conventional cytogenetics for a large number of bone marrow aspirates on which both types of studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that more than 90% of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with a clonal cytogenetic abnormality will be identified as abnormal by 4-color flow cytometry, and they therefore validate the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In experienced laboratories, 4-color flow cytometry represents a valuable addition to the workup of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e> and MDSs </plain></SENT>
