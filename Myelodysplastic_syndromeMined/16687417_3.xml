<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 87 intensively treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (median age 69 years) were analyzed, with the aim of comparing therapeutic results and toxicity between de novo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to a previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rate of CD34+ cells mobilization and feasibility of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in induction and primary resistance were not statistically different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median time for neutrophil recovery was similar, while s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients required a longer time for platelet recovery (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference as to eligibility for consolidation as well as for mobilization and feasibility of ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had negligible impact on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis the only parameter significantly related to either OS or DFS duration was adverse karyotype (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> does not represent a clinically relevant prognostic factor in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients treated with aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients can be mobilized and autografted with comparable results as opposed to de novo cases </plain></SENT>
