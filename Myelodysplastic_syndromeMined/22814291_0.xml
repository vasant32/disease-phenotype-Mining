<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only a few reports of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study if these translocations are cumulative-dose-dependent, their frequency in therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and the relationship between their presence, the type of therapy and the response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 120 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (108 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8 Hodgkin's disease and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>) in remission, being treated with topoisomerase 2 inhibitors; 74 had been diagnosed with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and 46 did not have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> bone marrow biopsy samples were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization for 11q23 point breakage in the MLL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MLL gene rearrangement frequency was 6% in dysplastic versus 2% in nondysplastic groups; p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was associated with a worse overall survival (mean 13 ± 2 vs. 39 ± 3 months, log-rank p value &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was dose-dependent with a cut-off value of 290 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> as assessed by ROC curve (area under the curve 0.84 ± 0.05, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that the MLL gene is etiopathogenetically relevant for hematological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> transformation and survival </plain></SENT>
