<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that a 600 bp long cluster of cell lineage specific hypomethylated sites in the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) on chromosome 22 exists in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine possible relationships between methylation patterns within the M-bcr and the stage of hematopoietic cell development, the M-bcr methylation status of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with non-rearranged M-bcrs was examined by BgIII-HpaII digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, the presence of a hypermethylated 4.8 kb BgIII-BgIII M-bcr allele was directly proportional to the combined myeloblast and promyelocyte percentage of the specimen, whereas the presence of a 2.5 kb BgIII-HpaII allele was directly proportional to the combined percentage of monocytic cells and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> showed a methylation pattern that closely resembled neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of thirteen surface immunoglobulin positive B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> showed a distinct methylation pattern consisting of three or more BgIII-HpaII restriction fragments of 2.5 kb or less in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> M-bcr methylation patterns, with four of seven showing a B-cell pattern and three showing a hypermethylated pattern with 4.8, 3.1/3.0 and/or 2.5 kb BgIII-HpaII M-bcr alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the M-bcr methylation status is related to the maturation of the neutrophil series; the surface immunoglobulin positive B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> are characterized by a distinct, extreme hypomethylation pattern of the M-bcr; and the B-cell precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> appear to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> M-bcr methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
