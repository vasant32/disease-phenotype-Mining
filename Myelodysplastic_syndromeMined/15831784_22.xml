<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were randomly assigned according to a crossover design to treatment A, consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> administered as a single 75-mg/m(2) SC dose, or treatment B, consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> administered as a single 75-mg/m(2) IV infusion dose over 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 28 days were permitted between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrated good bioavailability of a SC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> dose compared to an IV infusion treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exposure profiles following SC drug administration illustrate measurable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> levels with bioavailability (AUC) values within 89% of those measured following IV administration (range, 70%-112%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median IV half-life was 0.36 +/- 0.02 hours compared to 0.69 +/- 0.14 hours for SC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the route of administration, a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, 75 mg/m(2), was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
