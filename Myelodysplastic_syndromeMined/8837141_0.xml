<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 131 consecutive children (87 male, 44 female) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> who received TPN at our center from July 1984 to July 1990 with the aim of evaluating the efficacy and complications of TPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of TPN was associated with lack of any alteration of the anthropometric indexes used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complications were prevalently metabolic, generally mild, and easily controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory monitoring of nutritional status during TPN is probably of little value in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of in-ward preparation of TPN by nurses makes TPN possible at low cost provided that patients are selected carefully </plain></SENT>
