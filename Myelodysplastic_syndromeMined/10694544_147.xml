<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>; DAC) is a DNA hypomethylating agent that has shown a 50% response rate in a small phase II study in elderly patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a second, multicenter phase II study in a larger group of patients to confirm our findings and to study the toxicity of DAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1996 and September 1997, 66 patients (median age, 68 years) from seven centers received DAC 45 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days every 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients in whom a complete response (CR) was reached after two courses, two further cycles were administered as consolidation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of a stable disease situation, improvement, or a partial response (PR), a maximum of six cycles was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were response rate and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary end points were response duration, survival from the start of therapy, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The observed overall response rate was 49%, with a 64% response rate in the patients with an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) high-risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial median response duration was 31 weeks, with a response duration of 39 weeks and 36 weeks for patients who reached a PR or CR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial median survival time from the time of diagnosis was 22 months and from the start of therapy was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the IPSS high-risk group, the median survival time was 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival time was 25 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was rather common, and the treatment-related mortality rate was 7% and was primarily associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant responses were observed with regard to megakaryopoiesis, with increases in platelet counts having already occurred after one cycle of DAC therapy in the majority of the responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We were able to confirm our previous observation that DAC therapy was effective in half of the studied patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and is especially active in the patients with the worst prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was the only major adverse effect observed </plain></SENT>
