<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We knocked-in the AML1/EVI1 chimeric gene into mouse Aml1 genomic locus to explore its effect in developmental hematopoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AML1/EVI1/+ embryo showed defective hematopoiesis in the fetal liver and died around embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood had yolk-sac-derived nucleated erythroblasts but lacked erythrocytes of the definitive origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although E12.5 fetal liver contained progenitors for macrophage only, E13.5 fetal liver contained multilineage progenitors capable of differentiating into dysplastic myelocyte and megakaryocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No erythroid progenitor was detected in E12.5 or E13.5 fetal liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic progenitors from E13.5 AML1/EVI1/+ fetal liver were highly capable of self-renewal compared with those from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maintained expression of PU.1 gene and decreased expression of LMO2 and SCL genes may explain the aberrant hematopoiesis in AML1/EVI1/+ fetal liver </plain></SENT>
