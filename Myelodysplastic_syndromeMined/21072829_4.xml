<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> is also a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e>; a significant proportion of patients develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Since 2004, eight HSCT have been performed in seven patients at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications were transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/L (n = 2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) mutation(s) (n = 2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) resistance (n = 2), and at the patient's own request (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at transplantation was 13 years (2.8-28 years) (mean follow-up 32 months, range 21-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients harbored ELANE mutations, three HAX1 mutations, and in one patient no causative mutation was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the ELANE mutations were novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients initially received myeloablative conditioning and four had reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three grafts were from HLA-identical siblings, three from matched unrelated donors and two were cord blood units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Engraftment occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of seven (29%) patients died; both had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/L and both were among the three that underwent myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient has <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD 2 years post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The role of HSCT should be explored further in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In particular, the influence of the conditioning regime needs to be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
