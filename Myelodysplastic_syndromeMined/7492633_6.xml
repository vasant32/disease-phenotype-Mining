<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a 1-year-old neutered male cat developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (M6) after a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Er) on the criteria of FAB classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 2, a 1-year-old neutered female cat, which had close contact with Case 1, also developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (M6Er) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, marked proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells with disproportionally large numbers of immature forms was observed in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, neoplastic proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow was also noted at the terminal stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy with daunomycin was partially effective for treatment of these erythroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, but did not induce complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis using exogenous FeLV-specific probes indicated the clonal origin of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the erythroid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid tumor</z:e> cells in Case 1 were shown to be derived from independent transformed clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variant FeLV was shown to be integrated into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in Case 1, while a full-length FeLV was found in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because these erythroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> occurred in two unrelated cats kept in the same household and these diseases are rare, they may both have been associated with the same FeLV strain </plain></SENT>
