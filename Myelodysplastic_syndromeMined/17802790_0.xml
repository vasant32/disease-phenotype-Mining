<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test feasibility of transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells (THSC) with conditioning in low-intensity regimen associated with minimal toxic complications and engraftment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> (HM) from a high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: THSC was performed in 33 patients aged 18 to 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and advanced forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had severe complications excluding standard transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation preparation was based on fludarabine and moderate doses of busulfane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in 94% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of complications, there were primarily <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, relapses, graft versus host reactions (45, 24, 57.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 53%, relapse-free--67%, follow-up median 23.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: THSC after conditioning in the regime of low intensity is an effective method of HM treatment in patients with contraindications to standard transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main problem is a high risk to develop graft versus host reaction, especially a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form </plain></SENT>
