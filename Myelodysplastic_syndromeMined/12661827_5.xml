<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index [AI]) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) as a predictive indicator of BM failure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PB from 42 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at diagnosis and BM aspirates from 22 of these 42 patients were analyzed using Papanicolaou-stained preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cells were clearly seen in Papanicolaou-stained preparations from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and control cases and were confirmed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic myeloblasts and promyelocytes were frequently detected in BM; on the other hand, apoptotic neutrophils were abundantly seen in PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AI values of PB (mean +/- SD, 2.15 +/- 1.59) and BM (2.55 +/- 1.28) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those of control cases (PB, 0.48 +/- 0.27; BM, 0.72 +/- 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between AI values of BM and of PB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (r = 0.731; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Papanicolaou method was suitable for the observation of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was considered that a strong susceptibility to peripheral granulocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was, at least in part, one of the possible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, excessive intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was recently reported to cause a poor prognosis (because of an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from BM failure) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results indicate that AI of PB is a good indicator of AI in BM, and consequently, of BM failure in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
