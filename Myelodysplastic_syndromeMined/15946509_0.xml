<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clonal origin of the apoptotic hematopoietic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> whose karyotypes had been analysed with G- or R-binding were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ISEL (DNA in situ end labelling) and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) (simplified as ISEL/FISH) were performed simultaneously in a single nucleated cells on cytospin slides in 10/19 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of FISH positive cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells and to apoptotic cells were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight slides from 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by Fas monoclonal antibody (McAb) were used as methodology control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the rest 9 patients, different fractions of cells (PI-, Annexin V+PI-, Annexin V-PI-) were sorted by flow cytometry and then cytospined for FISH analysis (simplified as FCM/FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean percentage of abnormal clonal cells in nuclear cells in the 10 cases detected by ISEL/FISH was 37.1%, whereas it was 24.0% in apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction by Fas McAb didn't lead to change of karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 8/9 patients analysed by FCM/FISH showed higher cell proportion with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-undergoing cells than that in non-apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Over apoptotic hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are mainly residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
