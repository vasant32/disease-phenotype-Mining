<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> were the first-choice treatment for pancytopenic disorders that were often poorly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are now superseded by other more recently developed methods of treatment--for example bone marrow transplantation and immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This contrasts to the authors' experience, and to that of many other haematologists, who have noted anabolic steroid-induced responses in patients who were unsuitable for or unresponsive to the new treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Anabolic steroids</z:e> did not, however, demonstrate an obvious effect in recent controlled trials involving patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their use with immunosuppressive treatment is currently under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> rarely reverse the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, even a slight haemopoietic improvement is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> may benefit from a reduced transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uraemic patients may experience significant side effects on standard erythropoietin (epo) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There have been no controlled trials comparing epo versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> or epo versus epo in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from uncontrolled studies indicate a better response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> in children and females than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spite of the fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> have been used for almost 30 years, they should be carefully re-evaluated in scientifically controlled trials to test their efficacy and to compare them with the new treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such trials, however, are impeded by the limited knowledge available with regard to pharmacological parameters and optimal treatment schedules </plain></SENT>
