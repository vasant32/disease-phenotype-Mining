<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This treatment is occasionally associated with prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein describe the cases of CLL who underwent fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and rituximab (FCR) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examinations performed during periods of prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> revealed definite myelodysplastic changes in the myeloid and erythroid lineages </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was characterized by a short latency interval and a benign clinical course </plain></SENT>
