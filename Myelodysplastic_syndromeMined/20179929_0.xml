<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the factors that are predictive of prognosis of patients with abnormal karyotypes are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and World Health Organization classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) in 164 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the prognostic relevance of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that both IPSS and WPSS had strong prognostic value in patients with abnormal karyotypes (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed the significant differences in the survival of patients with abnormal karyotypes based on MCV stratification: The median survival of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> was 31.0 months, significantly longer than the 16.5-month median survival time of patients with MCVs of less than 100 fl (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that lower level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P = 0.012, HR = 6.83), higher level of marrow blasts (P &lt; 0.001, HR = 1.93), complex karyotype (P = 0.001, HR = 3.32), and MCV of less than 100 fl (P = 0.026, HR = 1.75) were independent risk factors that affected the survival of patients with abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
