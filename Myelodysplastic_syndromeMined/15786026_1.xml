<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) has remained at 7 to 8 years since the 1960s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Targeted treatment using radioimmunotherapy (RIT), radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies directed against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens, is an attractive option for this patient population, combining the advantages of an active biologic therapy with low dose-rate irradiation of an inherently radiosensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two anti-CD20 RIT agents have now been approved for the treatment of refractory NHL: 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin; Biogen Idec Inc, San Diego, CA, and Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) is approved in both the United States and Europe, and 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar; Corixa Corp, Seattle, WA) is approved only in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the development of 131I-tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because 131I-labeled antibody clearance varies significantly among patients, prescription of 131I-tositumomab activity must be based on a calculated total-body dose derived from quantitative whole-body imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated total-body dose has been established at 75 cGy in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves and less than 25% bone marrow involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (65 cGy in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; 45 cGy in patients who have received stem cell transplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a phase III trial, overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate were significantly higher following 131I-tositumomab than following the patient's last qualifying chemotherapy (ORR, 65% v 28%; P &lt;.001; CR, 20% v 3%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>131I-tositumomab has also been shown to be effective in patients who are refractory to rituximab (ORR, 70%; CR, 32%) and as first-line therapy in patients with NHL (ORR, 97%; CR, 63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major side effects of 131I-tositumomab are hematologic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the phase III study, 20% of patients experienced grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and 22% experienced grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> have been reported in 8.4% of patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease treated with 131I-tositumomab, but have not been observed to date in patients receiving 131I-tositumomab as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future progress in NHL management is likely to include RIT as part of a multi-modality approach; trials are planned or currently underway to investigate the combination of RIT with chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
