<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite these observations, little is known about the clinical importance of ras mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical impact of ras mutations in 99 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated in two prospective multicenter trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify areas surrounding the codons 12, 13, and 61 of the three ras genes N-, K-, and H-ras from DNA from bone marrow cells, ras mutations were detected by an algorithm based on allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 99 (18%) patients harbored mutations in either N- or K-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the observed mutations occurred in N-ras (N = 10) and K-ras (N = 5) or concurrently in both N- and K-ras (N = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between ras-negative and ras-positive patients according to age, sex, blood counts, cytogenetic abnormalities, or French-American-British classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, univariate analysis suggested a longer survival in ras-positive patients (P = .11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for age, which was the most important factor affecting outcome, the presence of a ras mutation emerged as a significant predictor for improved survival (P = .03) and along with lower bone marrow blast counts (P = .02) and better cytogenetic category (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of an aberrant ras allele was strongly correlated with lower bone marrow blast counts (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, whether a mutation in the N-ras or K-ras proto-oncogenes directly affects treatment outcome or indirectly through an association with lower leukemic burden remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these findings counter the prevailing bias that oncogene mutations lead to more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
