<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Agreement between two observers was obtained for 94% of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM cellularity was increased in 63% of the cases and was higher in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysmegakaryopoiesis and dyserythropoiesis were present respectively in 83% and 72% of the cases, with slight differences among the FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) was found in more than half of the cases and somewhat more frequently seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> group (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>Eosinophilia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e> and reticulin <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were evident in 26%, 18% and 47% of the cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellularity (P = 0.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (P = 0.009) and, to some extent, dysmegakaryopoiesis (P = 0.07) bore a certain relationship with survival on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of ALIP was not seen to affect the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the cellularity and presence of dysmegakaryopoiesis, in BM biopsy, added significant independent prognostic information to that achieved with age, platelet count and proportion of blast cells in BM aspirate, three variables with proven prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a regression model including these five characteristics we have stratified the patients into low, intermediate and high-risk groups with different survivals (P = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present findings show that BM biopsy is able to provide both morphological characteristics and information about the prognosis of survival, and should thus be included in the initial evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
