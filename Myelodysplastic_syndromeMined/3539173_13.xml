<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> bone-marrow mononuclear cells were labelled with murine monoclonal antibodies HLA-DR, VIL-A1 (CALLA), 3813, VIM-D5 and with a rabbit antiserum to TdT using a double colour indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition simultaneous detection of cytoplasmic mu chains (Cy mu) and of TdT was carried out and a direct immunofluorescence analysis for surface membrane immunoglobulins (SmIg) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two main populations were present: the major one being HLA-DR+, Cy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>, VIM-D5+, TdT-, CALLA-, SmIg-; the minor one HLA-DR+, Cy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>, VIM-D5-, TdT+, CALLA-, SmIg- </plain></SENT>
