<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we retrospectively compared the outcome after a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/total body irradiation (Cy-TBI) regimen, an intensified Cy-TBI regimen (Cy-TBI+), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Bu-Cy) regimen, and a Bu-Cy regimen with total lymphoid irradiation (Bu-Cy-TLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of 1875 adult patients who underwent unmanipulated unrelated BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> by using 1 of the 4 regimens between 1993 and 2002 were extracted from the database of the Japan Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the conditioning regimen was adjusted for other independent significant factors by multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cy-TBI regimen was significantly better than the Bu-Cy regimen with regard to the incidence of engraftment failure (odds ratio, 2.49; P = .046) and overall survival (relative risk [RR], 1.31; P = .050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Bu-Cy-TLI regimen decreased relapse (RR, 0.13; P = .039) but increased nonrelapse mortality (RR, 1.89; P = .0061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Cy-TBI+ regimen resulted in increased nonrelapse mortality (RR, 1.48; P = .0003) and inferior survival (RR, 1.45; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this retrospective study suggested that the Cy-TBI regimen was superior to other regimens in unrelated BMT </plain></SENT>
