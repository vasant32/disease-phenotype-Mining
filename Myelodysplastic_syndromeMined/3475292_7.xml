<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relation between prognosis and lineage specific surface antigen expression on peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes was studied using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry in 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in antigen expression were summarised as a score, and cases were divided into low (few abnormalities) and high (many abnormalities) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly worse in the "high" group (logrank chi 2 = 5.793, p = 0.016), this group having a median survival of 31 weeks, compared with more than 67 weeks in the "low" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between the score and any of the following: peripheral blood platelet and granulocyte count; FAB subtype; bone marrow blast cells and sideroblast count, or erythroid and myeloid progenitor growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigen expression was also studied in six further cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> before and after six weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> (CRA), 20 mg given orally, and a comparison was made with six untreated patients studied before and after a similar time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the treated group 58% of initially abnormal measurements reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, compared with 24% in the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the six treated patients showed a decrease in the score, whereas only two of the six improved in the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that myeloid antigen expression is a useful indicator of prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that antigen expression may be affected by treatment </plain></SENT>
