<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> on overall survival compared with the three commonest conventional care regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a phase III, international, multicentre, controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial, patients with higher-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were randomly assigned one-to-one to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (75 mg/m(2) per day for 7 days every 28 days) or conventional care (best supportive care, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, or intensive chemotherapy as selected by investigators before randomisation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by French-American-British and international prognostic scoring system classifications; randomisation was done with a block size of four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients assigned to receive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00071799 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2004, and Aug 7, 2006, 358 patients were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (n=179) or conventional care regimens (n=179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and 14 in the conventional care groups received no study drugs but were included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 21.1 months (IQR 15.1-26.9), median overall survival was 24.5 months (9.9-not reached) for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> group versus 15.0 months (5.6-24.1) for the conventional care group (hazard ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.77; stratified log-rank p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 82 patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> group had died compared with 113 in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, on the basis of Kaplan-Meier estimates, 50.8% (95% CI 42.1-58.8) of patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> group were alive compared with 26.2% (18.7-34.3) in the conventional care group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Peripheral cytopenias were the most common grade 3-4 adverse events for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> increases overall survival in patients with higher-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> relative to conventional care </plain></SENT>
