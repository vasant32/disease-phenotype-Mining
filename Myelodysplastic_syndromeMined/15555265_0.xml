<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of cytogenetic and IPSS grouping of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (pMDS) patients classified by FAB- or WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and thirty seven cases of pMDS who were previously classified according to FAB criteria were reclassified with WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made between the results of the two classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the detection rates of cytogenetic abnormality and its risks group, there was no difference among the FAB subgroups but the detection rate was different between the WHO refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) and RA subgroups (74.4% and 42.5%, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of good karyotype abnormalities in RA (65.0%) was higher than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (24.4%) (P &lt; 0.001), and the percentages of intermediate and poor karyotype abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (48.9% and 26.7%, respectively) were higher than that in RA (27.5% and 7.5%, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the subgroups and IPSS risk groups for both the WHO classification and the FAB classification, but the WHO classification further reflected the differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of low-risk group in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (1.1%) was lower than that in RA (10.0%) (P &lt; 0.05), and the percentage of high-risk group in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> (30.5%) was higher than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e>(0) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the correlation between subgroups and cytogenetic abnormalities and IPSS risk groups, the WHO-classification is better than the FAB-classification </plain></SENT>
