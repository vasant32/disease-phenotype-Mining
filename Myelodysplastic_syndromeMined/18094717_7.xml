<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, we studied CECs in 128 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had higher CEC levels than controls (P&lt;0.001), and an inverse relationship was found between CECs and international prognostic scoring system risk (r=-0.55, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between marrow microvessel density and CECs, low-risk patients showing the strongest association (r=0.62, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated a progenitor-to-mature CEC ratio, which was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in healthy subjects (P&lt;0.001), the highest values were found at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CECs assessed by flow cytometry positively correlated with the ability to produce endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro (ECFCs; r=0.57, P=0.021), which was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in controls (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that a variable proportion of CECs (from 40 to 84%) carried the same chromosomal aberration as the neoplastic clone, while endothelial cells isolated from in vitro assays were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that CECs reflect the <z:mp ids='MP_0000260'>abnormal angiogenesis</z:mp> found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially in the early stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased number of functional endothelial progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> strengthens the rationale for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interaction between hematopoietic progenitors and marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
