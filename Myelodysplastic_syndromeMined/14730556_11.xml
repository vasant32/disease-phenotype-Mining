<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry studies of surface markers of neutrophils have been performed mostly on peripheral blood, and for a limited spectrum of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studying maturation defects on developing neutrophils in the bone marrow (BM) may be helpful in BM diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied an expanded panel of antibodies to examine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maturation patterns in 26 control samples of BM together with microscopic correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promyelocytes correlated well with the CD24(-) and CD11b(-) populations, and metamyelocytes correlated well with the CD16(+) population (intermediate positivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An excellent correlation was also identified between the sum of bands and segmented neutrophils and each of the following: CD16(++) (strong positivity), CD35(+), CD87(+), and CD64(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although visually identified segmented neutrophils paralleled CD10 positivity, there was an appreciable difference between both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neutrophilic granulocyte maturation in the BM is accompanied by a change in surface antigens that reflects certain stages of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A successful strategy for detecting maturation defects is to include several antibodies that are known to be expressed or absent at the same stage of maturation, such as CD16, CD35, CD64, and CD87 </plain></SENT>
