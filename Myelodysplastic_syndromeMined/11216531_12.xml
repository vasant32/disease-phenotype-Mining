<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Annexin V, a specific marker of the early to intermediate phases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, has been applied to the in vitro study of bone marrow aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A noninvasive measure of intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vivo that could serially monitor the clinical progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> may be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used 99mTc-radiolabeled annexin V and radionuclide gamma camera imaging to serially study the sites, extent, and severity of intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intravenously administered radiolabeled annexin V localized preferentially in the femur, pelvis, vertebrae, and spleen; increased uptake in these organs was easily visualized as early as 8 h after injection of 100 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in 8- to 10-wk-old animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (150 mg/kg) in animals of the same age increased annexin V uptake in the bone marrow and splenic tissue and delayed recovery of these organs as seen histologically compared with lower doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older animals, 5-6 mo old, showed a slower response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment and delayed recovery of bone marrow and splenic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiolabeled annexin V can be used to detect and directly quantify the degree of intramedullary and splenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a noninvasive fashion using current clinical radionuclide imaging equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annexin V imaging may be useful clinically in the diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
