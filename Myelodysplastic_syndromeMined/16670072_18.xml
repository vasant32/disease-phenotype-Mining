<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts) received treatment with rabbit-ATG plus CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 30% (6/20); three of the six responders had a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The responses lasted 2-58 months, with two patients still being in complete remission at 42 and 58 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-lasting cytogenetic remissions were achieved in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATG was poorly tolerated in patients over 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four out of 20 patients progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> within a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunosuppressive treatment may be a therapeutic option for selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
