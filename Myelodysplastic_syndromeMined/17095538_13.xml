<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gene silencing through aberrant CpG island methylation is the most extensively analyzed epigenetic event in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and has huge diagnostic and prognostic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation patterns are often very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, however, presenting a serious challenge for the development of methylation assays for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used Pyrosequencing technology to determine the methylation status of 68 CpG sites in the CpG island of the CDKN2B gene [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15, inhibits CDK4)], frequently hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, in a series of bone marrow samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 82) and from 32 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 7762 individual methylation sites were quantitatively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Precision and reproducibility of the quantification was evaluated with several overlapping primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of optimized sequencing primers and the new Pyro Q-CpG software enabled precise and reproducible quantification with a single sequencing primer of up to 15 CpG sites distributed over approximately 100 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive statistical analyses of the whole CpG island revealed for the first time disease-specific methylation patterns of the CDKN2B gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and small regions of differential methylation with high discriminatory power that enabled differentiation of even low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> samples from the controls, a result that was confirmed in an independent group of 9 control and 36 patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The precise quantitative methylation mapping of whole CpG islands is now possible with Pyrosequencing software in combination with optimized sequencing primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method reveals disease-specific methylation patterns and enables the development of specific diagnostic assays </plain></SENT>
