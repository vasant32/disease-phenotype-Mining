<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 17 cytopenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) subtype with hyper-, normo- or hypo-cellular bone marrow (BM), who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substantial haematological response was observed in 14 patients (82%): their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> improved and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete trilineage recovery was observed in four patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CyA therapy has not yet failed in any of the 14 successfully treated patients during follow-up times ranging from 5 to 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CyA was well tolerated in 14 patients; serious side-effects required termination of the therapy in three patients in whom the blood count rapidly deteriorated to former levels upon cessation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients benefited from a combination therapy of CyA and erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced various autoimmune phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CyA could thus offer an alternative treatment for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with RA regardless of hyper-, normo- or hypo-cellularity of bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the beneficial effect of CyA is discussed and remains the subject of an ongoing study </plain></SENT>
