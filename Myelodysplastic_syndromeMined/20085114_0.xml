<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trend presents an important challenge to MCOs who must respond to changing protocols and rising costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas the new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> medications offer a unique opportunity to improve outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, they also demand high financial outlay, which in turn necessitates adjustments in benefits programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As payers look to manage expenses in ways that satisfy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stakeholders, increasing importance is placed on scientific evidence, survival and QoL benefits, tolerability factors, and evidence-based standards of care </plain></SENT>
