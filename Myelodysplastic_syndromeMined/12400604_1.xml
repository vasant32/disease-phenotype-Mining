<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a multicentric study involving 14 Italian Haematological Divisions during a 10-year-period whose object was to identify the characteristics of patients with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study recorded 391 consecutive documented IF, 12 of which (3%) occurred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from five of the participating centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary localisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the lung in 10 cases and skin and paranasal sinus in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients died at the end of the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was mainly attributable to IFI progression in nine of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factors which appeared related to an unfavourable outcome were intensive chemotherapy within 30 days before IFI diagnosis, presence of multiple localisation at chest X-ray in patients with isolated pulmonary IFI and multiple sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
