<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It should be entertained as an alternative diagnosis in patients with cytopenias being assigned the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, B-prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Causative etiology or molecular defects remain unclear, although nonspecific chromosomal and molecular changes have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The typical presentation is that of a middle-aged man with an incidental finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and inaspirable bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogue, cladribine or pentostatin, results in extremely high, durable, overall, and complete response rates, although resistance and relapses do occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A variant subtype exists and is frequently associated with a poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of its simplified dosing schedule, cladribine is commonly used as the initial therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New agents, such as rituximab and BL22, are actively being evaluated and show promising results in both HCL subtypes </plain></SENT>
