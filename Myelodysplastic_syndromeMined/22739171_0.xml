<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FCM was used to count the blast rate and detect the expression of its antigens in 29 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The result indicated that: (1) The rate of the blasts detected by FCM and BMS was not statistically significant between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> (P &gt; 0.05); (2) Out of 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>, the blasts of 10 cases, 12 cases, 8 cases, 11 cases, 11 cases, 3 cases, 7 cases, 0 case, 0 case, 3 cases and 2 cases patients had positive expressions of CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, CD33, CD13, CD15, CD11b, CD3, CD19, CD7 and CD56, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blasts of 12 cases, 13 cases, 3 cases, 12 cases, 15 cases, 7 cases, 5 cases, 0 case, 1 case, 4 cases and 2 cases among 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> positively expressed CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, CD33, CD13, CD15, CD11b, CD3, CD19, CD7 and CD56, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the expression of antigens in blasts of the bone marrow between the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> (P &gt; 0.05); (3) The positive expression for CD15 and CD11b in blasts was found in 10 cases and 12 cases, respectively; (4) The positive expression for CD19, CD7 and CD56 was observed in 1, 7 and 4 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 29 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was positive for CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that FCM can reveal the characteristics of immunophenotypic abnormalities of the blasts in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and provide the important information for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
