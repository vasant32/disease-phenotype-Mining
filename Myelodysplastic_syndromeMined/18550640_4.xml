<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 13 patients with BD associated with BMF (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 8 cases, AA 5 cases) and 66 patients with BD not associated with BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the international BD study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD patients with BMF showed significantly lower leucocyte count, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level and platelet count when compared with patients without BMF (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BD patients with BMF had significantly higher serum CRP level at the time of BD diagnosis compared with patients without BMF (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intestinal lesions were more frequent in BD patients with BMF than those without BMF (61.5% vs 13.6%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormality was observed in 90.9% of BD patients with BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the cytogenetic abnormalities, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was most common, occurring in 70% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients with refractory BD associated with BMF, successful treatment of BMF by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted in clinical remission of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ulceration</z:e> is a characteristic finding in BD associated with BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that cytogenetic aberration, especially <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD associated with BMF </plain></SENT>
