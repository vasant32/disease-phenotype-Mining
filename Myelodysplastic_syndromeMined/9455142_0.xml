<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the hMDS patients (4 men, 1 woman) was 51.0 years (range 31-61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied the hematological features of the 5 cases in the early stage without chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They showed, 1) appearance of erythroblasts (3/5), 2) more reticulocyte counts than typical AA (mean 7.8 x 10(4)/microliter), 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> (mean MCV 106fl) in peripheral blood, 4) relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> (M/E ratio 0.2-1.5), and 5) low lymphocyte counts (mean percentage of lymphocytes 32, 8%) in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering about the differences or transformation between AA and hMDS, it is interesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients have initially had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and subsequently developed chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
