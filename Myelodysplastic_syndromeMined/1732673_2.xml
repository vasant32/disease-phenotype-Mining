<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are, almost by definition, pre-leukaemic disorders, we expect that bone marrow from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> must contain cells which are one step short of full leukaemic transformation: we designate these cells, for convenience, as "n-1" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It should be possible therefore to obtain leukaemic transformation in vitro by introducing into n-1 cells a gene with an appropriate leukaemogenic mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found, by using as a model system the retrovirus VSN-2 (which carries the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi>-phosphotransferase gene, neo, which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418), that human bone marrow cells can be successfully transfected in microcultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, G418-resistant CFU-CM have been recovered from these cultures for a period of several weeks </plain></SENT>
