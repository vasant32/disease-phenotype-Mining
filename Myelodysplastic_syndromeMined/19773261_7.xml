<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis and systematic review was carried out of randomized controlled trials comparing treatment with hypomethylating agents to conventional care, i.e., best supportive care or chemotherapy, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcomes assessed were overall survival, time to transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, overall response rate and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated and pooled for time-to-event data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For dichotomous data, relative risks were estimated and pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four trials including 952 patients examined the effect of 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with hypomethylating agents significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.85, three trials) and time to transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.82, four trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup analysis per type of drug, these benefits could be shown for 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> but not for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both agents favorably influenced response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of grade 3/4 adverse events was observed with their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> prolongs overall survival and time to transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> it should be highly considered in the treatment of patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to establish the exact role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> compared to 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in these patients </plain></SENT>
