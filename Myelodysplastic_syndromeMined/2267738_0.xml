<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated in a group of 56 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> the clinical impact of assessed chromosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They found a close relationship between the frequency of chromosomal deviations and the extent and activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors did not detect a relationship between the frequency of karyotypic changes and the number of plasmocytes in bone marrow nor a significant difference in the incidence of hypodiploidy in different immunochemical types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with chromosomal changes had a reduced response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors revealed a prognostic importance of chromosomal changes, in particular of hyperdiploidy and the concurrent incidence of numerical and structural deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss the relationship of monosomia of the X chromosome and the Y chromosome to the clinical picture of the disease and chromosomal findings in secondary myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and secondary plasmocellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
