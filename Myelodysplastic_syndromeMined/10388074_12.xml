<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion in first ruling out other disorders that can also cause peripheral blood/bone marrow cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distinguishing biological characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is that it is a clonal disorder of the marrow with impaired differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies implicate extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as the explanation of the paradoxical observation of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> but peripheral blood cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> account for the primary clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in terms of an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, which is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clonal nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> places it also at continual risk for transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predicting overall survival as well as the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation has been improved by the recent development of a scoring system (International Prognostic Scoring System) that incorporates three laboratory variables: percent of marrow blasts, degree of cytopenias, and presence of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these variables, four prognostic subgroups can be delineated ranging from low risk with a median survival of 5.7 years, to high risk with a median survival of 0.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can now be based on the patient's respective prognostic subgrouping, with low-risk patients being considered for hematopoietic growth factor singly or in combination if at the point of red cell transfusion dependence and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>recurrent infections</z:hpo>, while high-risk patients should be offered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-induction therapy or novel agents such as topotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One must individualize further in patients in the remaining intermediate groups, I and II, in choosing the most appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future advances upon understanding the molecular details of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone should ultimately improve the care of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
