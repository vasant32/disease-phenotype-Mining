<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative but is associated with life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occur within the first 2 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we examine long-term survival in 2-year survivors in the largest cohort ever studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 10,632 patients worldwide reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who were alive and disease free 2 years after receiving a myeloablative allogeneic HCT before 2004 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9 years, and 3,788 patients had been observed for 10 or more years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of being alive 10 years after HCT was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chief risk factors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included older age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients who underwent transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, relapse was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The greatest risk factor for late relapse was advanced disease at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Principal risk factors for nonrelapse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were older age and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with age, sex, and nationality-matched general population, late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> remained higher than expected for each disease, with the possible exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although the relative risk generally receded over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prospect for long-term survival is excellent for 2-year survivors of allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, life expectancy remains lower than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Performance of HCT earlier in the course of disease, control of GVHD, enhancement of immune reconstitution, less toxic regimens, and prevention and early treatment of late complications are needed </plain></SENT>
