<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A reduced incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GvHD) has been documented among Japanese allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients, as the Japanese are genetically more homogeneous than western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether this ethnic difference affects the results of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), we conducted a nationwide survey to compare clinical outcomes of allogeneic PBSCT (n = 214) and BMT (n = 295) from a human leucocyte antigen-identical-related donor in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD was 37.4% for PBSCT and 32.0% for BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD at 1 year was significantly higher after PBSCT than BMT (42% vs. 27%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The organ involvement patterns of GvHD were different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analyses, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD was significantly increased in PBSCT, whereas the stem cell source did not affect the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD, transplant-related mortality, relapse or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that Japanese PBSCT patients have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD compared with BMT patients, but the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD was still lower than in western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the choice of haematopoietic stem cell source should be considered based on data for individual ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
