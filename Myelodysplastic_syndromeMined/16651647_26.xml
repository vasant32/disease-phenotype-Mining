<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> (0.25 mg/kg/d) on 5 consecutive days per week for 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks' rest (one cycle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patient cohorts were established according to International Prognostic Scoring System risk category: lower-risk (low or intermediate-1) or higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (intermediate-2 or high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, hematologic improvement (HI) was the primary response end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, additional end points included complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the expected time to response, patients receiving two or more cycles were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematologic adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during the study due to treatment-related toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, pain, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients who received one or more doses (n = 70) or completed two or more cycles (n = 51), the HI rates were 34% and 39% in lower-risk patients, and 6% and 9% in higher-risk patients, respectively; the overall major HI rates were 20% and 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One higher-risk patient achieved a complete remission (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major HIs were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematologic lineages; erythroid responses were the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transfusion independence or reduction by &gt; or = 50% occurred in 33% of patients dependent on RBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall median duration of HI was 6.8 months (range, 2 to 40 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">Arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> monotherapy has moderate activity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with a manageable adverse effect profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The further study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in combination with other agents, is warranted </plain></SENT>
