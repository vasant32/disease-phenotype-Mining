<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment in low- and intermediate-I-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is supportive therapy consisting of regular transfusions and growth factors, that is, erythropoietin (Epo) and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because flow cytometric analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow samples can identify clinically relevant subgroups regarding transfusion dependency and disease progression, we addressed the question whether flow cytometry (FCM) was instrumental in predicting response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 46 patients with low- and intermediate-I-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that were treated with Epo/G-CSF, low Epo level and low transfusion need were associated with response to Epo/G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, aberrant phenotype of myeloblasts identified nonresponders among patients with the greatest response probability according to the predictive model of Hellstr√∂m-Lindberg et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aberrant FCM of myeloblasts acted as a significant biomarker for treatment failure in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new predictive model based on the basis FCM combined with previously validated Epo levels is proposed defining 3 subgroups with 94%, 17%, and 11% response probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FCM may add significantly to well-known predictive parameters in selecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients eligible for Epo/G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is of relevance regarding prevention of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
