<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta 1 inhibited SKM-1 cell proliferation due to the cell cycle arrest in G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF abrogated the TGF-beta 1-mediated G1 arrest in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that TGF-beta 1-mediated G1 arrest correlated with the down-regulation of cdk4, cdk6 and cyclin D2, and that abrogation of TGF-beta 1-mediated G1 arrest by GM-CSF correlated with the constitutive over-expression of cyclin D2 and cdk6 but not cdk4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the importance of cyclin D2/cdk6 levels in abrogating G1 arrest in cells exposed to TGF-beta 1, and raise the possibility that the GM-CSF-mediated up-regulatory pathway of signal transduction through cyclin D2/cdk6 differs from the TGF-beta 1-cdk4-mediated pathway in SKM-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This signal transduction pathway through cyclin D2/cdk6 might play an important role in haemopoietic regulation by the cytokine network </plain></SENT>
