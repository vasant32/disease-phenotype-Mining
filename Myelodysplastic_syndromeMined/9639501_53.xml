<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that treatment with the combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and epo may increase this response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present phase II study, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were randomized to treatment with G-CSF + epo according to one of two alternatives; arm A starting with G-CSF for 4 weeks followed by the combination for 12 weeks, and arm B starting with epo for 8 weeks followed by the combination for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty evaluable patients (10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> [RA], 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>], and 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>]) were included in the study, three were evaluable only for epo as monotherapy and 47 for the combined treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to G-CSF + epo was 38%, which is identical to that in our previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rates for patients with RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> were 20%, 46%, and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response rates were identical in the two treatment groups indicating that an initial treatment with G-CSF was not neccessary for a response to the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients in arm B showed a response to the combined treatment, but only three of these responded to epo alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests a synergistic effect in vivo by G-CSF + epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A long-term follow-up was made on 71 evaluable patients from both the present and the preceding Scandinavian study on G-CSF + epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 26 months, and the overall risk of leukemic transformation during a median follow-up of 43 months was 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients entered long-term maintenance treatment and showed a median duration of response of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) was effective to predict survival, leukemic transformation, and to a lesser extent, duration of response, but had no impact on primary response rates </plain></SENT>
