<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, different from the single-gene disorders, high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of many of the complex diseases prevents scientists from the exact understanding of the etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> family of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells, as a general model to explore the network properties of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, static bioinformatics analysis suggests that despite the huge <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of MDSs, their clinical properties can be explained well by the local properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related genes on the human interactome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then we design a novel systems biological method to explore the pattern of genetic abnormality propagation of a real <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cohort by integrating flowcytometry, genotyping, gene expression profiling, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) mapping and pathway inference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We constructed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease gene network which suggests the network basis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pipeline we proposed and the implication the results suggest may be helpful in the research of other complex diseases </plain></SENT>
