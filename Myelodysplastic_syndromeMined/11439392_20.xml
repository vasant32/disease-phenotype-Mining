<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may be associated with occupational or industrial exposures and risk may vary by the histological type of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Iowa and Minnesota to evaluate the association between various occupations, industries, and occupational exposures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 513 cases and 1,087 controls was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lifetime occupational history and other risk factor information were collected through in-person interviews, and a job-exposure matrix was used to assess possible risks associated with specific exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was observed among agricultural service industries and among nursing and healthcare workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Janitors, cleaners, and light truck drivers also experienced increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those employed in plumbing, heating and air conditioning industries, and sales of nondurable goods (such as paints and varnishes) had an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Printers, painters, and workers in the food and metal industries had a nonsignificantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses by specific exposures and histology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> showed that risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated with occupational or industrial exposures may vary by histological type of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among workers employed in agricultural industries, nursing and healthcare workers, and in a few occupations with possible exposure to solvents is consistent with earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associations of risk with occupations not observed previously deserve further assessment </plain></SENT>
