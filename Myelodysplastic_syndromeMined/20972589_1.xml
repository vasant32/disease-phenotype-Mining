<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (IFI) remain a clinical concern in hematological patients with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> because they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a recent randomized trial, prophylaxis with posaconazole was associated with fewer IFI and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> relative to a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> (Flu/Itra) control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, a cost effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the economic value of posaconazole as an alternative to Flu/Itra when used to prevent IFI in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed using clinical and economic data from randomized comparative trials, the economic literature, and from expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were then used to estimate the incremental cost per life year saved with oral posaconazole prophylaxis relative to Flu/Itra from the Canadian provincial health care system perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The base case results were then tested with a sensitivity analysis which evaluated extremes in the incidence of IFI as well as variations in their cost of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prophylaxis with posaconazole provides increased efficacy and an overall cost savings of approximately $Can4,259 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite variations in the base case parameters, the sensitivity analysis suggested stability in the primary findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Posaconazole was associated with an overall cost savings (range = $Can1,765 to $Can4,505) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the scenarios evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimal cost effectiveness was obtained because the drug was able to avoid the more resource intensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with posaconazole in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> is not only cost effective but also cost saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The economic benefits were due to the drug's ability to reduce the incidence of high cost <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e>, particularly Aspergillus species </plain></SENT>
