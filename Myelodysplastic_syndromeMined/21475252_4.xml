<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) are older, with many unsuitable for conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) is superior to best supportive care but is still inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> (ATO) and LDAC showed promise in an unrandomised study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a randomised trial of LDAC versus LDAC+ATO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> according to WHO criteria or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with &gt;10% blasts, considered as unfit for conventional chemotherapy, were randomised between subcutaneous Ara-C (20 mg b.d. for 10 days) and the same LDAC schedule with ATO (0.25 mg/kg) on days 1-5, 9 and 11, for at least four courses every 4 to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 166 patients were entered; the trial was terminated on the advice of the DMC, as the projected benefit was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall 14% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 7% CRi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 5.5 months and 19 months for responders (CR: not reached; CRi: 14 months; non-responders: 4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in response or survival between the arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 cardiac and liver toxicity, and supportive care requirements were greater in the ATO arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This randomised comparison demonstrates that adding ATO to LDAC provides no benefit for older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
