<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, up to 17% of cases of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> may have a preleukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In young patients, the goal of treatment is eradication of the preleukemic malignant clone and reconstitution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has proved to be capable of this, but the optimal conditioning treatment to achieve eradication remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between May 1989 and June 1993, eight consecutive pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received a marrow transplant from an HLA-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) non-reactive sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis at time of presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in two patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) in three, and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>, the pediatric counterpart of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) in the remaining three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and melphalan, three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> potentially capable of killing also dormant preleukemic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen was very well tolerated, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients engrafted promptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six out of eight patients (75%) are alive and well with a median observation time of 20 months (range 8-34 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial karyotype monitoring and molecular analyses have demonstrated a full chimerism of donor cells and the complete disappearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 detected before transplant in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients have a Karnofsky score of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One boy, affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 resistant to treatment with low-dose ara-C, relapsed 11 months after BMT, evolved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and died from progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Another patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> died on day +95 after BMT due to interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> of unclear etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that allogeneic BMT is the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and suggests that the employed conditioning regimen is a safe and effective means for eradicating the preleukemic malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Particularly noteworthy is that the three children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> obtained a complete remission and one of them is now a long-term survivor </plain></SENT>
