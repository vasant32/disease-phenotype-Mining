<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this first analysis of data from the North American Association of Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registries (NAACCR), encompassing 82% of the US population, we evaluated trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CMD incidence, estimated case numbers for the entire United States, and assessed trends in diagnostic recognition and reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on more than 40 000 observations, average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CMD for 2001 through 2003 were 3.3 and 2.1 per 100,000, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates increased with age for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CMD (P &lt; .05) and were highest among whites and non-Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on follow-up data through 2004 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, overall relative 3-year survival rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and CMD were 45% and 80%, respectively, with males experiencing poorer survival than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applying the observed age-specific incidence rates to US Census population estimates, approximately 9700 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 6300 patients with CMD were estimated for the entire United States in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence rates significantly increased with calendar year in 2001 through 2004, and only 4% of patients were reported to registries by physicians' offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease burden in the United States may be underestimated </plain></SENT>
