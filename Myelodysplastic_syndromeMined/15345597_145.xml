<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated 20 patients, each with mutant FLT3 relapsed/refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and not believed to be candidates for chemotherapy, with an FLT3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, PKC412 (N-benzoylstaurosporine), at a dose of 75 mg 3 times daily by mouth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug was generally well tolerated, although 2 patients developed fatal pulmonary events of unclear etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blast count decreased by 50% in 14 patients (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (35%) experienced a greater than 2-log reduction in peripheral blast count for at least 4 weeks (median response duration, 13 weeks; range, 9-47 weeks); PKC412 reduced bone marrow blast counts by 50% in 6 patients (2 of these to &lt; 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLT3 autophosphorylation was inhibited in most of the Corresponding patients, indicating in vivo target inhibition at the dose schedule used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PKC412 is an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> with clinical activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> whose blasts have an activating mutation of FLT3, suggesting potential use in combination with active agents, such as chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
