<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The survival of older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> has not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few clinical trials have been available for older patients who are not considered fit for an intensive chemotherapy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 1998 and November 2003, as part of National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Institute <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>Acute Myeloid Leukemia</z:hpo> 14 Trial, 217 patients, who were deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy were randomized to receive low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C) (20 mg twice daily for 10 days) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-dose ara-C produced a better remission rate (18% vs 1%; odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.06-0.37; P = .00006) and better overall survival (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81; P = .0009), which was accounted for by the achievement of complete remission (CR) (duration of CR: 80 weeks vs 10 weeks for patients with no CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had adverse cytogenetics did not benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATRA had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity scores or supportive care requirements did not differ between the treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older, less fit patients have a poor outcome, and few trials have been conducted in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-dose ara-C treatment was superior to best supportive care and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> because it had greater success in achieving CR, and it could represent standard care against which new treatments may be compared in this patient group </plain></SENT>
