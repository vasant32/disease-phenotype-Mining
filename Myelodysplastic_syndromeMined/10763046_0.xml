<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The majority of the presently known nonrandom chromosome changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> were described during the 1970s and 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The last 10 years have been devoted to the location of oncogenes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes altered as a consequence of those changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New molecular methodology has helped speed this process, which has resulted in DNA sequencing of many of the genes involved, permitting molecular detection of abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This review examines the most common alteration-based subgroups of cytogenetics and molecular genetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> with the exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognosis has been updated to reflect improving treatment protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The versatility of cytogenetics for delineating genetic changes is difficult to match by molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once a clonal anomaly is identified, molecular methodology can detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> with far greater sensitivity than cytogenetics, but relies on translocation junction targets that exclude clones characterized by deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic and molecular testing offers independent diagnostic and prognostic evaluation for most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
