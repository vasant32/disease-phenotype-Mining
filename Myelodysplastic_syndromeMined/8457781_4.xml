<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A response was defined as an increase in Hb by greater than 2 g/dl and/or a decrease in transfusion requirement by greater than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to be evaluable if on study greater than two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of thirteen evaluable patients had a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with RA had a sustained trilineage hematologic response with no evidence of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had trouble with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests than an occasional patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will respond to rHuEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some patients, this may be beneficial clinically </plain></SENT>
