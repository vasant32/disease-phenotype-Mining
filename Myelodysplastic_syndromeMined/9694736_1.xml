<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 12p13 translocation, the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene is disrupted and fused to its partner genes such as PDGFR-,2 ABL,3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-1.4 On the other hand, invesion 12 at p13 is a rare abnormality and only 9 cases (1 AML and 8 MDS) were reported previously.5-8 Whether the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene is involved in this aberration has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here an additional case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with inv(12)(p13q15) in which the rearrangement of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
