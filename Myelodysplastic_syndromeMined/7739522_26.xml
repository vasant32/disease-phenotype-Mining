<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the functional analyses of AML1/Evi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was revealed that AML1/Evi-1 itself does not alter the transactivation level through mouse polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2; PEA2) sites (binding site of AML1) but dominantly suppresses the transactivation by intact AML1, which is assumed to be a stimulator of myeloid cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA-binding competition is a putative mechanism of such dominant negative effects of AML1/Evi-1 because it binds to PEBP2 sites with higher affinity than AML1 does </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AML1/Evi-1 stimulated c-fos promoter transactivation and increased AP-1 activity, as Evi-1 (which is not normally expressed in hemopoietic cells) did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments using deletion mutants of AML1/Evi-1 showed that these two functions are mutually independent because the dominant negative effects on intact AML1 and the stimulation of AP-1 activity are dependent on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp> domain (DNA-binding domain of AML1) and the zinc finger domain near the C terminus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that AML1/Evi-1 blocks granulocytic differentiation, otherwise induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, of 32Dcl3 myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that both AML1-derived and Evi-1-derived portions of the fusion protein play crucial roles in this differentiation block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the leukemic cell transformation in t(3;21) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> is probably caused by these dual functions of AML1/Evi-1 chimeric protein </plain></SENT>
