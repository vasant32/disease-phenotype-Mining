<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In pretransplantation therapy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> is typically given every 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We infused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> once daily at 130 mg/m2 for 4 days, performing pharmacokinetic analyses on plasma concentration-time data (n = 60 patients) on days 1, 3, and/or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean (percent coefficient of variation) maximum concentration, volume of distribution, half-life, and clearance were 3.6 microg/mL (13.8%), 22.6 L/m2 (20.2%), 2.73 hours (27.5%), and 109 mL/min/m2 (26%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean (percent coefficient of variation) and median daily areas under the curve were 4873 (21.8%) and 4871 microM x minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrapatient variability in day-to-day estimated clearance was &lt;20%, without day-to-day drug accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmokinetic parameters were compared with those from 47 patients given intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> at approximately 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 32 mg/m2) every 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is (1) a dose proportionality based on mean and median areas under the curve, (2) unchanged estimated clearance with a 4-fold increase in dose and a 2.5-fold difference in dosing rate, (3) negligible variability in dose-to-dose pharmacokinetics and negligible interdose accumulation with once-daily administration, and (4) no change in pharmokinetic parameter(s) with concomitant use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> antifungals, oral contraceptives, or phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> has highly predictable, linear pharmacokinetics from 32 mg/m2 (approximately 0.8 mg/kg) to 130 mg/m2 (approximately 3.2 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, once-daily intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> dosing is convenient, favoring its more widespread application </plain></SENT>
