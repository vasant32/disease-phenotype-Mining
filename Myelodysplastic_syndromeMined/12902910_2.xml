<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of outcome for newly diagnosed children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was performed using data collected from CCG-2891 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors identified 11 patients whose blasts carried t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q among 470 eligible patients entered with acceptable, centrally reviewed cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow specimen was used for each case of cytogenetic analysis in which 20 banded (either G-banded or Q-banded) metaphases were completed on each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients had characteristic monocytoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (M4 or M5) and tended to be young (0.1-7.9 years; median 0.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients entered remission, but remissions tended to be short; 9 patients relapsed within 12 months (median 4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate of 82% was significantly higher for this group of patients compared with 46% for the group at large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate for this group of patients having t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was also significantly higher compared with subjects with other 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse rate of 55% was higher for this group of patients compared with 3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse rate was higher for the subjects who had t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q compared with subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other chromosome 11 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three children survived, two in second remissions (4.7 and 6.3 years after relapse) and one in first remission (7.0 years after diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients with cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) translocations and other rearrangements of chromosomes 10 and 11 was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from the 11q23 group of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to determine the various changes that are occurring at the molecular level for patients with t(10;11) translocations and other rearrangements of chromosomes 10 and 11 to gain insight into the mechanisms causing this clinical phenotype associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
