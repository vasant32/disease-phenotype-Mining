<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we enrolled 14 MDS patients (4 RA, 2 RARS, 6 RAEB, 2 CMML), 44-80 (median 60) years old, in a pilot trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Etanercept, 25 mg, was given twice a week s.c. for 16 weeks (increased to three times a week if no response at 8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 12 evaluable patients, four had rises in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> by 1-1.5 gm/dl (three) or decreased transfusion requirements (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>increased platelet counts</z:hpo> (54% and 73%), and two increased neutrophils (63% and 120%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline TNFalpha levels, determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, did not correlate with responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among eight marrows available for sequential in vitro assays, four showed increases in CFU-GM of 1.5- to 5-fold at 8 weeks, whereas three showed 3- to 10-fold decrements relative to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, etanercept treatment resulted in moderate improvements of cytopenias in some patients, while cell counts declined in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional trials are needed to evaluate its clinical efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
