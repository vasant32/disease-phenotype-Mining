<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Certain stem cell transplantation procedures might slow down inflammatory pathology in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To halt disease progression in aggressive MS by a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) protocol aimed at maximum T cell suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autologous BMT was performed in 14 patients with rapid secondary progressive MS (median EDSS score at baseline, 6; median disease duration, five years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To accomplish rigorous T cell ablation, a strong conditioning protocol was chosen--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, total body irradiation, and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To minimise the possibility of reinfusing mature T cells in the graft, bone marrow, not peripheral blood, was used as the CD34+ stem cell source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow up was 36 months (range, 7-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant haemopoietic recovery was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early toxicity included Epstein-Barr virus related post-transplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longterm effects were development of antithyroid antibodies (three) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of progressive disease five years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure, defined by EDSS increase sustained for six months or more, was seen in nine patients and stabilisation or improvement in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other clinical parameters generally showed the same outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhanced lesions were seen on post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging, in either cerebral or spinal cord scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands remained positive in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This strong immunosuppressive regimen did not prevent clinical progression in patients with aggressive secondary MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The lack of efficacy, together with some serious side effects, does not favour the use of similar rigorous T cell depleting protocols in the future </plain></SENT>
