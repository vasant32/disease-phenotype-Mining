<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that serum stem factor (SCF) levels are significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now studied the effects of adding SCF to cultures of blood mononuclear cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed marked increases in erythroid colony numbers with SCF + erythropoietin compared to interleukin-3 + erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases (1RA and 1ISA) the erythroid colony numbers became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same RA patient also showed a marked increase in myeloid colony numbers, which were undetectable with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone, but within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range when SCF was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fourth patient (ISA) showed a 4.7-fold increase in myeloid colonies with SCF, but no erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects showed a trend towards increased numbers of myeloid colonies with SCF; erythroid colonies did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and erythroid colony numbers with and without SCF, but there was no correlation between erythroid or myeloid colonies in the presence of SCF and their serum SCF level </plain></SENT>
