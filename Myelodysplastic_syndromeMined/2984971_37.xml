<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0006733'>acute megakaryocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and the third was believed to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with a prominent megakaryocytic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinical characteristics of these patients and review of the literature suggest that the proximate association of mediastinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ-cell tumors</z:mpath> with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> is neither a coincidence nor a consequence of chemotherapy given for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ-cell tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe this association represents the evolution of a neoplastic disorder that initially involves a totipotent germ cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These germ cells, when located in the mediastinum, apparently acquire hematologic phenotypes and are manifested clinically as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
