<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of the Y chromosome in elderly males is a benign finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 15 is rare and may represent another age-related abnormality, particularly in males, together with -Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 3,242 routine referrals sent to our laboratory for BM cytogenetics, over a period of 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected 5 cases with uncomplicated <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15, 3 in males and 2 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients had the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 males showed a -Y cell line, although the 2 females did not have an X chromosome loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients were alive and well at times varying from 12 months to 4 years post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the further analysis of our referral cohort, there were 62 males with loss of the Y chromosome as the sole abnormality, and of these 47 (76%), were referred with myeloid disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15 in our laboratory was 1/475 referrals, but 1/292 in successful cultures from new patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report providing frequency data for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further data with longer term follow-up is required to establish the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15 in elderly leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
