<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report an adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> family in whom enriched tissue-specific transcripts were derived by subtractive hybridization of cDNA from the mononuclear and CD34+ cells of affected and unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These expression libraries were then hybridized to Genome Discovery arrays containing 18 404 genes and expressed sequence tags, and several clusters of differentially expressed genes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of 21 genes was underexpressed (&gt;5-fold) in affected vs unaffected family members, and among these were transcription factors and genes involved in myeloid differentiation, such as ZNF140 and myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another group of 36 genes was overexpressed (&gt;5-fold), and these encoded proteins belonging to signaling pathways, such as Ras- and Fos-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The top two genes downregulated in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> family, ZNF140 and MNDA, were similarly altered in another <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> family, and in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that we have identified genes differentially expressed in adult familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that alteration of some of these genes may also be important for the evolution of different stages or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
