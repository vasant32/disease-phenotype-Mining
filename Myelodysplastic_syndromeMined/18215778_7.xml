<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the outcome of RIC HSCT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients over the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients were treated with a fludarabine and low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI)-based pretransplantation regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-compatible sibling (68%) or unrelated volunteers (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 AML patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of patients had a poor risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematologic recovery was fast, and primary graft failure occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with active disease at the time of HSCT experienced ongoing relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> were diagnosed in 9 patients (21%), and 6 patients (14%) were treated for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD), which was grade II in 40% and grade III in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (cGVHD) was 33% at 1 and at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low (9%), total nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 571 days, 16 patients (37%) experienced relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free and overall survival (DFS; OS) were 24 and 31 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in complications and outcome between recipients of sibling and unrelated grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, fludarabine plus low-dose TBI-based RIC HSCT is effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients over the age of 40 years without active disease at the time of transplant and is associated with low TRM </plain></SENT>
