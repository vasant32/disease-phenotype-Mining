<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of adding both the multidrug resistance modulator cyclosporin (CsA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to a standard salvage regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (IDA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> was evaluated in patients with resistant or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients received IDA 12 mg/m2/day, the next four patients 9 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose of CsA was 16 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed Pgp expression and none MRP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade III or IV toxicity (CTC-NCIC criteria) was registered in six patients for gastrointestinal, two patients for cardiovascular and one patient for neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients died in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and three patients showed leukemic regrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three control patients were treated with IDA 12 mg/m2/day and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, but no CsA and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma IDA and idarubicinol (ida-ol) area under the curve's of patients treated with IDA 12 mg/m2 plus CsA were higher (P&lt; 0.05) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cellular IDA concentrations were almost similar, but cellular ida-ol concentrations were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the presence of CsA than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the toxicity either with IDA 12 or 9 mg/m2/day was too high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The modulating effect of CsA was mainly based on changes in plasma kinetics of IDA and ida-ol, although ida-ol cellular clearance was delayed in the presence of CsA </plain></SENT>
