<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> seemingly caused by tacrolimus (FK506) in spite of blood concentration near the upper limit of therapeutic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 26-year-old man received FK506 to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He underwent an intravenous injection of FK506 the day before transplantation (day -1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> from day 2 to day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography scan showed a low density area with unclear border in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, these symptoms improved with discontinuation of FK506, which was strongly suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> caused by FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood concentration of FK506 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was 21.7 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although this value was slightly higher than the standard therapeutic range (10-20 ng/mL), it was within clinically acceptable range in the early stage after stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that even if the blood concentration of FK506 is within the therapeutic range, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> may develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, although the blood concentration of FK506 is useful as an indicator for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, we propose careful monitoring not only of the blood concentration but also clinical status for the detection of initial symptoms and prevention of aggravation </plain></SENT>
