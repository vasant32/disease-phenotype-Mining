<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 69 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 86 RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 75 RAEB in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t), and 4 unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System was intermediate-2 or high in 104 of the 158 available scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses focused on transplantation-related mortality (TRM), 2-year treatment failure incidence, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of PBPCs reduced the median duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> by 4 and 12 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was similar whatever the graft type used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was more likely to have occurred with PBPCs (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-3.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-year TRM was significantly reduced with PBPCs (relative risk [RR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.73; P &lt;.007), except for patients who had either RA or high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year treatment failure incidence was significantly decreased with PBPCs, from 38% to 13% (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.48; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Estimate of the 2-year event-free survival was 50% with PBPCs versus 39% with BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the outcome was significantly improved with PBPCs (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13-0.52; P &lt;.001), except for patients with either RA or high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PBPCs might be preferred for allogeneic transplantation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at high risk for relapse on the basis of morphologic criteria because the use of this hematopoietic stem cell was associated with lower treatment failure incidence and improved survival </plain></SENT>
