<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent technological advances have led to the identification of a myriad of frequently occurring genomic perturbations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and its progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is a genomic instability disorder, resulting from a step-wise accumulation of genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The notion is now emerging that the underlying mechanism of this disease may be a defect in one or more pathways that are involved in responding to or repairing damaged DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will discuss these pathways in relationship to a large number of studies performed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient samples and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in view of our current understanding of how DNA damage response/repair pathways are affected by age in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, we will also explore how this might relate to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
