<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age is similar in hypo- and normo-/hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (72.6 versus 70.7 versus 72.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurred significantly more often in women compared with normo- and hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential biopsies were performed in 14 patients, showing a persistence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> over a period of up to 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients showing mesenchymal reaction, especially an increase of mast cells, was significantly higher in hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas dysplastic features of hematopoiesis occurred less frequently and were of lower grade in comparison to normo-/hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the subgroup with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo>, the classification according to FAB criteria revealed 28 patients with RA (66.7%), three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (7.1%), and eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (19.0%), as well as one patient each with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and CMMol (2.4% each), and one case which had to be reckoned among the category of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">unclassifiable MDS</z:e> (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 21.8 months for hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 26.9 months for normoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 14.2 months for hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 14 patients (33%) with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although not a constant finding, karyotype abnormalities involving particularly chromosome 7 seem to be associated with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the existence of a hypoplastic variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> which seems to more frequently affect female patients, and which requires bone marrow biopsy for its accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
