<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between differentiation of human myeloid cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that terminal differentiation need not necessarily lead to the apoptotic demise of myeloid cells, while other studies have shown that induction of differentiation is associated with increased resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing agents, such as chemotherapy and gamma-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such results are pertinent to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, where differentiating agents and hemopoietic growth factors are being combined with chemotherapy to enhance response and limit toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the factors governing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts, we have studied the cytotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> on HL60, U937 and KG1 cells, after incubation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA), 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that prior incubation of human myeloid leukemic cells with ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 D3 induced resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was modulated by coincubation with GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The altered chemosensitivity of cells depended on the degree of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest induced by incubation with ATRA, 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and GM-CSF and was independent of differentiation status or Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cell-cycle arrest in human leukemic cells can be induced by exogenous agents and may promote drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Determining the mechanisms by which cell-cycle arrest is induced may permit understanding of the processes by which the cells escape cytotoxic drug-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
