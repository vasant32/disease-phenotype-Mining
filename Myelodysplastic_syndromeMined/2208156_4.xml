<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the natural progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to ANLL, we investigated the relationship of exposure to these carcinogens in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by having 52 such patients diagnosed and referred to our center answer an occupational/environmental questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> patients with exposure to previous chemotherapy and radiation for a previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we prospectively gave the same questionnaire to a similar number of age- and sex-matched comparable control patients from the same socioeconomic group based on their residence, health insurance coverage, and occupation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a 46% exposure rate to implicated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> in our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were exposed had 75% incidence of a poor prognosis French-American-British classification compared to 57% in the nonexposed group but the difference was not significant (P = 0.089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the karyotypic abnormalities that were associated with exposure in ANLL were found equally in both exposed (55%) and nonexposed groups (50%) of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and our control group had a similarly high exposure rate at 40% to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Implicating a relationship between exposure to pesticides and solvents in ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the previous studies indicating such a relationship did not use a control group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate the pitfalls of historical data without investigating the bias of obtaining an exposure history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, our findings that the majority of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients came from the middle socioeconomic group which has a high exposure rate as shown by our control group indicate a relationship and that prospective follow-up of the exposed cohort of control patients should be done to determine if ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> will increase after a latent period compared to the nonexposed controls </plain></SENT>
