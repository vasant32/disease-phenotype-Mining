<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed the splicing repertoire of CDC25C- a gene localised to chromosome 5q31 and encoding a cyclin/cyclin-dependent-kinase regulatory phosphatase critical for cell cycle checkpoint control - in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and healthy tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five novel splicing isoforms were detected, and the splicing patterns were generally distinct in neoplastic samples compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the novel isoforms, which we have termed CDC25C-6, occurred in 58% of the samples in our cohort </plain></SENT>
