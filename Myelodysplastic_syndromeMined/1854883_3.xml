<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of activated transforming genes was investigated in four patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and in three with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA of bone marrow cells from six of the patients exhibited transforming activity in the tumorigenicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients who were positive in the tumorigenicity assay contained activated N-ras oncogenes, and three contained activated K-ras oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, concurrent activation of N-ras and K-ras oncogenes was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide dot-blot analysis was used to investigate mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the N-ras and K-ras oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients exhibited an N-ras mutation, substituting aspartic acid (GAT) for glycine (GGT), and three patients exhibited an N-ras codon 13 mutation, substituting valine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>) for glycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients exhibited K-ras codon 12 mutations, substituting aspartic acid (GAT) or cysteine (TGT) for glycine (GGT), respectively, and one case exhibited a K-ras codon 61 mutation, substituting lysine (AAA) for glutamic acid (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis revealed that loss of chromosome 7 was frequent (four patients: 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that activation of N-ras and K-ras genes, as well as loss of heterozygosity for specific alleles on chromosome 7, plays a more important role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> of both therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
