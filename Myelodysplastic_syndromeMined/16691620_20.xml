<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of immune enhancement using recombinant interferon gamma1b (rIFN-gamma1b) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who received GTX for refractory, systemic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty recipients of high-dose donor GTX ( approximately 5.5 x 10(10) neutrophils per transfusion) who had received concurrent rIFN-gamma1b between October 2001 and December 2004 were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) was 45 +/- 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (50%) were men, 17 patients (85%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 3 patients (15%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients (n = 18 patients; 90%) had recurrent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677936" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients (30%) who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b was given a median +/- SD of 26 +/- 100 days (range, 12-372 days) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (85%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> during GTX therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient (5%) had refractory Pseudomonas aeruginosa <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (40%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> during GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median +/- SD of 8 +/- 7 GTX doses (range, 4-28 doses) and 9 +/- 7 rIFN-gamma1b doses (range, 1-28 doses), for a mean +/- SD cumulative dose (CD) of 400 +/- 2621 microg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other concomitant cytokines were granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 3 doses; CD, 6720 +/- 4721 microg) in 15 patients (75%) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 9 doses; CD, 4750 +/- 4410 microg) in 14 patients (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four patients (20%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and 2 patients (10%) developed skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after therapy started, 9 patients (45%) had complete or partial resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; and, in another 3 patients (15%), the invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> had become stable </plain></SENT>
