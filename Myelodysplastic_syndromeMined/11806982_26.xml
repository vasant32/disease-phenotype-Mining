<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 77 patients with APL who were consecutively treated at a single institution and who achieved CR after induction and consolidation therapy, 5 (6.5%) acquired therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (tMDS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), or both (tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3 of 46 (6.5%) patients received front-line chemotherapy with or without ATRA and acquired tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> while in first remission of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two underwent repeated chemotherapy cycles with ATRA because of APL relapse and acquired tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> while in the second or third remission of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, clinical and biologic characteristics of tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were as expected for postalkylating forms (long latency, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, karyotypic aberrations involving chromosomes 5 or 7), even though one of them had not previously received alkylating drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 5 patients died shortly after tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosis, one is alive with tMDS, and one is alive and in CR after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of tMDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after successful therapy for APL is an emerging problem </plain></SENT>
