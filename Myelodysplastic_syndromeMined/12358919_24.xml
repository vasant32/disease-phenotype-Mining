<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome following volunteer-unrelated donor (VUD) or sibling allogeneic SCT was therefore evaluated in 23 MDS patients conditioned with reduced-intensity regimens (fludarabine/busulphan/Campath-1H) because of advanced age (48 vs 37 years, P = 0.002) and/or co-morbidity (19 vs 3, P &lt; 0.0001) which precluded conventional transplantation, and compared with 29 treated with standard protocols [busulphan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Bu/Cy); Bu/Cy/total-body irradiation/Campath-1G] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred per cent donor engraftment (variable number tandem repeat analysis/cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization) was achieved in 18/19 (95%) evaluable patients receiving reduced-intensity regimens, although six (32%) have subsequently shown mixed chimaerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced-intensity conditioning was associated with significantly reduced duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, less mucositis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, antibiotic, <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, parenteral nutrition use, less <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, and lower early procedure-related mortality [two (9%) vs nine (31%), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients relapsed (two standard, four reduced-intensity) and two (reduced-intensity) experienced late graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 year actuarial overall/disease-free survival (OS/DFS) was 48/39% in the reduced-intensity arm and 44/44% in the standard group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2 year non-relapse mortality was 31% and 50% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In VUD recipients, OS was superior in the reduced-intensity arm (49%vs 34%) </plain></SENT>
