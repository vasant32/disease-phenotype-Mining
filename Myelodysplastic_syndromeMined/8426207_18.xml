<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) M195 (anti-CD33) is reactive with most myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, monocytes, and hematopoietic progenitors, but not with other hematopoietic cells or stem cells nor with nonhematopoietic human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A therapeutic dose-escalation study of M195 labeled with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 131 was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients (16 relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo>, five blastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>], two chemotherapy-related secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and one blastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>]), including seven who had failed to respond to prior bone marrow transplantation (BMT), received from 50 mCi/m2 to 210 mCi/m2 of 131I-M195 in divided doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 22 patients, whole-body gamma-imaging demonstrated marked uptake of antibody into <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (96%) demonstrated decreases in peripheral-blood cell counts, with decreased percentage of bone marrow blasts seen in 83% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of bone marrow biopsies examined quantitatively demonstrated substantial decreases in the number of blasts, with greater than 99% of blasts killed in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two cases that failed to demonstrate leukemic cytoreduction occurred in the first two dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For 131I doses of 135 mCi/m2 or greater, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was profound and lasted for at least 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had sufficient marrow cytoreduction to proceed to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of these achieved marrow remission, one of 6+, and one of 9 months' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> temporarily reverted to their original myelodysplastic states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent of assessable patients developed human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two patients with HAMA who were re-treated, plasma 131I-M195 levels could not be maintained and no therapeutic effect resulted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant nonhematologic toxicity (hepatic) was seen in one patient and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that safe leukemic cytoreduction can be achieved with 131I-M195 even in multiply relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This agent may be useful as part of a preparative regimen for BMT </plain></SENT>
