<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of HFE gene mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in 271 Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 402 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and 1,615 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in combination with DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No C282Y mutations were observed in the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of H63D heterozygous and homozygous genotypes was not significantly different between the AA cases and the controls (9.7% versus 10.2%, 0.25% versus 0.24%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the H63D heterozygous genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly lower than that in the controls (4.1% versus 10.2%, p = 0.002), the H63D homozygous genotype was not detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that HFE gene mutations are not common genetic factors in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared iron metabolic parameters, including serum ferritin, serum iron, and transferrin saturation values, between HFE mutant and HFE <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> groups in the absence of transfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, but no significant difference was found in either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or AA patients except that the level of serum iron in AA patients was significantly higher in mutant carriers than in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HFE (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant difference between HFE mutant and HFE <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA patients in clinical indices such as alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, fasting blood sugar values, and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that H63D mutations may not have clinical significance in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
