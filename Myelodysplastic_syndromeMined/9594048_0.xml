<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The instrument was submitted to an extensive evaluation procedure before acceptance to the laboratory and was found to perform satisfactorily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, problems arose in clinical practice with the analysis of samples from patients recovering from bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Falsely low monocyte counts and, controversely, falsely high neutrophil counts were found in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only a minority (13%) of these samples were flagged as abnormal by the instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most alarming consequence of these results is the overestimation of neutrophils and the exclusion of these patients from reimbursement for treatment with growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in patients recovering from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, differential counts performed with the Sysmex NE series should always be checked manually </plain></SENT>
