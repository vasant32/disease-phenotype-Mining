<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of comorbidities on the survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 600 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who presented to MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center from January 2002 to December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) scale was used to assess comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on demographics, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), treatment, and outcome (leukemic transformation and survival) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression were used to assess survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prognostic model incorporating baseline comorbidities with age and IPSS was developed to predict survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall median survival was 18.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the ACE-27 categories, median survival was 31.8, 16.8, 15.2, and 9.7 months for those with none, mild, moderate, and severe comorbidities, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3 for mild, moderate, and severe comorbidities, respectively, compared with no comorbidities (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A final prognostic model including age, IPSS, and comorbidity score predicted median survival of 43.0, 23.0, and 9.0 months for lower-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Comorbidities have a significant impact on the survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe comorbidity had a 50% decrease in survival, independent of age and IPSS risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive assessment of the severity of comorbidities helps predict survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
