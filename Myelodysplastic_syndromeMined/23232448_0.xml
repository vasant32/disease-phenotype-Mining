<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nasal endoscopy revealed black necrotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with rhino-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">orbital mucormycosis</z:e> and commenced on intravenous antifungals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this therapy he progressed to have total unilateral loss of visual acuity and cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent emergency orbital exenteration and extensive cheek and sinus debridement </plain></SENT>
