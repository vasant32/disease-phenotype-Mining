<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have reported a high incidence of DNA hypodiploidy defined as DNA index (DI) in blasts/promyelocytes from 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) found to be without a relationship to cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the DNA content (DI) in granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes measured in the same bone marrow smears from the above patients are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA hypodiploidy was found in mature cells, not only in myeloid cells (granulocytes and monocytes) but also in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lower mean DI in each cell type of patients compared to controls was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pairwise comparison of the mean DI (+/-SE) in 32 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 22) and abnormal (n = 10) cytogenetics and controls (n = 8) showed a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower value for each group of patients, respectively, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of weak-Feulgen stained nuclei (DI &lt; 0.40) in granulocytes and monocytes was more pronounced in patients expressing DNA hypodiploid immature cell populations, but only occasionally in lymphocytes, suggesting a link to an apoptotic event and intramedullary cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA hypodiploidy is shown to be a common feature even in mature cell populations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonality, by means of DNA content, appears reasonable as regards the granulocytes and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA hypodiploid lymphocytes, on the other hand, might be small blasts (stem cells) or dying cell populations of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
