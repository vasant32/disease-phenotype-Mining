<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality through combined flow cytometry and molecular analysis of the complementarity determining region (CDR)-3 of the T-cell receptor-Vbeta gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified clonal T cells in 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (n=52) compared to 5% of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of T-cell clones was not associated with features linked previously to immunosuppression response, including WHO diagnostic category, karyotype, marrow cellularity, IPSS category, sex or age &lt;or=60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry to identify expanded Vbeta-families, we found that T cells showed greater expansion in the bone marrow compared with peripheral blood, and were characterized as CD8(+)/CD57(+)/CD28(-) effector T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expanded effector T cell were CD62L negative and expressed the natural killer C-lectin-family receptor NKG2D and CD244 (2B4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that clonal T-cell expansion is common among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prognostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
