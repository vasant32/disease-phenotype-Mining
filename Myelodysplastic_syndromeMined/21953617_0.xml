<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 46 patients affected by CLL/MPN referred by 15 Italian GIMEMA centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to define the following: clinico-biological characteristics, possible familiarity, clinical course of both diseases, and influence of MPN chemotherapy on the course of CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 46 patients, 30 patients were males, 16 patients were females; median age was 71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one case had familiar CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>Myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> consisted of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocytemia</z:e> in 18 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera in 10 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in 9 cases, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> in 6 cases, and MPN/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> was diagnosed as monoclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> in 8 patients and as Binet Stage A CLL in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 49 months, 9 patients experienced progressive CLL and only 6 patients required treatment after a median of 57.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The biological profile confirmed a subset of low-risk CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received chemotherapy for MPN without influence on the course of CLL: lymphocyte counts remained unchanged after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This series is the largest so far reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of concomitant CLL/MPN is a rare event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> present a clinical indolent course with a low-risk biological profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MPN therapy does not interfere with the prognosis of patients with CLL </plain></SENT>
