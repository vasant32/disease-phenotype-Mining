<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro growth and response to rSCF were quite variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in most cases, rSCF stimulated CFU-GM growth induced by rG-CSF, rGM-CSF, rIL-3, 5637 conditioned medium (50-1400% enhancement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rSCF effect was slightly more evident on day 14 CFU-GM and in the presence of rIL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BFU-E growth induced by rEPO or rIL-3 + rEPO was enhanced by rSCF in about 50% of cases, in linear correlation with the levels of patients' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rSCF did not increase CFU-E growth, whereas it slightly stimulated CFU-Mk in 33% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPO, SCF and, particularly, their combination, enhanced the recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-E and BFU-E after 7 days of liquid culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was less evident in cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CFU-GM generation in long term liquid cultures, although highly variable, was stimulated by rSCF and, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, by rSCF + rG-CSF, similarly to what was observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SCF seems to enhance in vitro erythropoiesis only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases presenting without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has little effect on megakaryocytopoiesis, while it seems to be more active on CFU-GM growth and maintenance </plain></SENT>
