<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow CFU-GM was assayed in the agar semi-solid culture, and the bone marrow cells were incubated in liquid culture and the expressions of CD33, CD15 and bcl-2 on the marrow cells were detected by APAAP method in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The suppressive effects of As(2)O(3) to CFU-GM were increased with the rise of As(2)O(3) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suppression of As(2)O(3) (0.388 micro mol/L) to cluster formation was stronger than to colony formation, the suppressive rates were 70.78% vs 34.05% in low-risk group, and 86.76% vs 65.86% in high-risk group (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>0.194 micro mol/L of As(2)O(3) decreased clusters and increased colonies in low-risk group, but decreased clusters and did not change colonies in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High concentration (1.94 micro mol/L) of As(2)O(3) downregulated the expression rate of CD33 and CD15 in both groups, and low concentration (0.194 micro mol/L) downregulated the expression rate of CD33 and upregulated the expression rate of CD15 in low-risk group, but decreased expression of CD33 and did not alter CD15 in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the high concentration of As(2)O(3) downregulated expression of bcl-2 and resulted in karyopyknosis and cytoplasm condensation; low concentration generated similar effect on expression of bcl-2 and cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in high-risk group, but did not affect in low-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that As(2)O(3) suppressed myelopoiesis and impelled myelomonocytic cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, low concentration of As(2)O(3) induced the proliferation and differentiation of myelomonocytic cells in low-risk group, however, suppressed the growth of myelomonocytic cells and accelerated the cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in high-risk group </plain></SENT>
