<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of 38.5 degrees C or higher associated with newly diagnosed lung infiltrates were randomized for an initial therapy with acylaminopenicillin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycoside</z:chebi> (Group A), third-generation <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23066">cephalosporin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycoside</z:chebi> (Group B), or the double <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35627">beta-lactam</z:chebi> combination (Group C), each in combination with rifampin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonresponders were given empirical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-fluorocytosine</z:chebi> beginning on day 4, day 5, or day 6 under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 295 patients entered, 91.2% were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete response was obtained in 61.3% with no significant difference between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of rifampin did not improve treatment results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 27.1% of patients achieved a complete response by antibiotic therapy without additional antifungal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fungi dominated in cases of microbiologically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and were associated with a poorer outcome compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The trend of leukocyte counts under study had a highly significant effect on the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lung infiltrates in febrile patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> represent a high risk of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> has a significantly adverse effect on the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of systemic antifungal agents into first-line therapy, particularly in selected high-risk subgroups, might improve future treatment results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The quality of diagnostic techniques to establish the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> needs to be improved </plain></SENT>
