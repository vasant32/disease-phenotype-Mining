<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients achieved complete remission (CR), one patient partial response, and four minor response while the remaining eight did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 65 (range 56-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean total amount of melphalan given was 140+/-19 mg in patients who achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CR was 14.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serious toxicity was not encountered in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither marrow suppression nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was observed during the administration of melphalan in patients who achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of CR patients included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> in biopsied specimen from the lilac bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that melphalan may exert some differentiation effects on leukemic cells in addition to cytotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that daily administration of low-dose melphalan is worth trying in the treatment of elderly patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
