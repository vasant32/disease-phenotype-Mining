<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have prospectively analyzed the clinical impact of recipient-derived chimeric cells in 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> after SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to improve sensitivity and specificity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples were cell-separated by using immunomagnetic beads according to the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> phenotype, expressed at diagnosis or relapse before SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of 30 patients experienced a clinical relapse after SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time for patients alive and without relapse (n = 15) was 30 (16-47) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mixed chimerism in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) &gt; or =1 month post SCT, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-affected cell lineage, was detected in 14/30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of these 14 patients relapsed as compared to 2/16 with donor chimerism (DC) (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients with MC in peripheral blood &gt; or =1 month after SCT relapsed vs 4/22 DC patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MC was detected a median of 66 (23-332) days before hematological relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between T cell MC and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this study, chimerism analysis showed a higher sensitivity and specificity vs morphological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study may provide a rational basis for treatment with adoptive immunotherapy at an earlier time after SCT than at present, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in order to treat recurrences of malignant disease </plain></SENT>
