<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were initially treated with pelvic radiotherapy; arm A, 2,250 rad in ten fractions; and arms B and C, 4,500 rad in 20 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Entry to arm C was discontinued early because of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a multifactor analysis using proportional hazards models, no significant difference in survival was observed although there was a marginally significant difference in disease-free survival (P = .015) with arm B being superior to arm A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stage (P less than .0001), grade (P less than .0001), and histology (P less than .008) were predictors of survival in the multifactor analysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rates are 62% for arm A, 61% for arm B, and 66% for arm C </plain></SENT>
