<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> M3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> L2 by bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and they were treated as such at the hematology department of a general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients died after one of them had considerably improved on being treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> crystalline <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> at high doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histopathological studies could not demonstrate the presence of neoplastic cells in bone marrow but leptospiras were found by means of silver stained preparations (Warthin - Starry) and immunofluorescence, both in this organ and in other tissues studied: kidney., spleen, liver and lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathological diagnoses were generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leptospirosis</z:e> with medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leptospirosis</z:e> with myelodisplastic syndrome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was reviewed the possibility that leptospira could cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857418" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemoid</z:e> syndromes and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it is recommended to hematologists, infectologists, pathologists, and others, to use again the technques of argentic impregnation, immunohystochemistry and immunofluorescence to study the bone marrow and other tissues in order to detect the possible presence of leptospira that would allow to treat the patients more effectively, particularly, patients like these that had serological titres considered negatives so as to avoid the false security existing in the official health institutions about the minimum or null impact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leptospirosis</z:e> cause in public health, which imply the absence of control systems for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spirochetosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
