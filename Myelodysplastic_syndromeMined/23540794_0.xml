<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 patients and 28 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure both bone marrow and peripheral blood serum hepcidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the gene expression of growth differentiation factor 15 and twisted gastrulation 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin (SF), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythropoietin were measured by routine standard laboratory assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) and CD19(+) lymphocytes and Th polarization were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were measured their cardiac and liver <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> levels through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between the bone marrow hepcidin levels and peripheral blood hepcidin levels (P = 0.134) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratified according to different World Health Organization subtypes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> patients had the lowest hepcidin levels (105.40 ± 5.13 ng/ml), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-1 had the highest levels (335.71 ± 25.16 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System and WHO Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System, there was a significant difference of hepcidin levels between low-risk group and high-risk group in two systems, respectively (P = 0.033 and 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hepcidin levels of CD4(+) high-expression group were demonstrated higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression groups (P = 0.02), but the CD19(+) high-expression group did not show the same result (P = 0.206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, patients with a Th1 polarization trend had a high level of hepcidin versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Liver iron concentration (LIC) measured by MRI T2* had a closer correlation (r = 0.582, P &lt;��0.001) to hepcidin than serum ferritin, by stepwise regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein and LIC seemed to be the key determinants of hepcidin, by multivariate regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> plays an important role in the regulation of hepcidin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>T-lymphocyte activation and Th polarization trend might participate in the regulatory mechanism partly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The capability of organ iron load assessment of MRI T2* seems better than that of SF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It seems that hepcidin with CRP and LIC measured by MRI T2* are potential indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
