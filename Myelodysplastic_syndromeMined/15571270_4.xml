<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phase I studies among 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> defined a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 40 mg/m2/d given as a one hour infusion daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study, 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> received clofarabine at the MTD over 1 hour daily for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (32%) achieved complete response (CR), 1 had a partial response (PR), and 9 had a CR but without platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic studies in the phase I trial revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in peak levels of clofarabine among patients at the end of infusion, however; there was a linear, dose dependent increase in clofarabine concentration in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacodynamically, at the MTD, DNA synthesis was inhibited by more than 80% at the end of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In phase II studies, the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> accumulation and clinical response at the MTD was explored, revealing an accumulation advantage of the cytotoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells of responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts of patients who respond to clofarabine therapy exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, clofarabine is an active agent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and cellular pharmacokinetics has prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
