<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple chromosome rearrangements (MCRs) are found in 5-10% of newly diagnosed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 15-30% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the initial causes of MCRs and the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nor are the karyotypic patterns well studied, mainly because of the difficulties of obtaining complete karyotypes by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied spectral karyotyping (SKY) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate further the resulting chromosome imbalances and rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow cells with MCRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow cells from 12 AML and 10 MDS patients with MCRs were collected at diagnosis and analyzed by G-banding, SKY and CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' characteristics were also collected to pinpoint potential similarities and/or differences between the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results show that some MCRs seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are similar to MCRs seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These MCRs often result in chromosome loss of 5q, 7q and 17p and gain of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics associated with MRCs include old age, previous exposure to radio- and/or chemotherapy and a short survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probably, these patients should be distinguished from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with primary chromosome rearrangements among other unbalanced chromosome rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our experience, SKY and CGH facilitated this process </plain></SENT>
