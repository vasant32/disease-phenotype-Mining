<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression level of LDH in 163 confirmedly diagnosed patients from 2001 to 2009 years in our hospital, the changes of LDH level in follow-up patients and relation of the LDH changes to prognosis, survival time and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression, as well as the relation of LDH level to blood cell count, ratio and karyotype of blast cells in bone marrow were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the median LDH level in 163 MDS patients at diagnosis was 214 U/L (range 102 - 865 U/L), the median survival time of patients with increased LDH (&gt; 240 U/L) was 25.6 months which was significantly shorter than that of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LDH level (56.8 months)(p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were classified according to IPSS, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>increased LDH level</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was observed in high risk and intermediate II groups (337.20 ± 298.00 U/L and 234.07 ± 216.00 U/L, respectively) which was significantly higher than that in low risk group (154.94 ± 46.08 U/L) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LDH level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression was obviously enhanced while LDH level in patients without progression was not enhanced, mainly maintained in stable level as compared with LDH level at diagnosis and before progression (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the increase of LDH level was found to be an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the LDH level may be used as indicator for judging prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which is helpful to early recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression and risk stratification of disease, as well as selection of rational therapy </plain></SENT>
