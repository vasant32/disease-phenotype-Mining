<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> has been shown to have survival benefits in patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and has activity in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection daily at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An oral formulation would facilitate dosing, reduce administration side effects and potentially maximize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> pharmacologic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously, oral formulations of this class of agent have failed due to rapid catabolism by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase and hydrolysis in aqueous environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Development of a film-coated formulation has circumvented this difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a formulation feasibility pilot study, four subjects with solid <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received single oral doses of 60 or 80 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects demonstrated measurable plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, allowing bioavailability comparisons to be made to historical pharmacokinetic data for s.c. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects safely tolerated 80 mg, a dose for which the mean bioavailability was 17.4% of historic s.c. exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No severe drug-related toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> is bioavailable in humans and should be studied in formal phase 1 trials </plain></SENT>
