<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CCD34(+) counts were stratified within both International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and World Health Organization (WHO) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Counts &gt;10/microl were associated with poorer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival, a prognostic value for evolution independent from that of WHO, and a higher progression probability within intermediate-risk IPSS and WHO classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When serial measurements were performed, counts &gt;10/microl more frequently correlated to evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separating newly diagnosed patients on the basis of 10/microl cut-off of circulating CD34(+) cells retains prognostic utility, especially in intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
