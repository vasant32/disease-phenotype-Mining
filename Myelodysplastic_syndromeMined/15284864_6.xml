<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absolute count of myeloid and lymphoid pDC, as well as their relative number (as proportion of mononuclear cells or total leukocytes) was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=22) than in healthy controls (n=41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with chromosomal aberrations, purified pDC were examined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This revealed clonal involvement of myeloid as well as lymphoid pDC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data therefore strongly suggest that myeloid and lymphoid pDC share a common precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether reduced peripheral blood counts of pDC contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains to be investigated </plain></SENT>
