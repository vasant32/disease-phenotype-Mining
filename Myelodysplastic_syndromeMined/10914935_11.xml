<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> often undergo transformation to a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599849" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the prognosis, high-dose treatment with stem cell support has been tested, but its role in the treatment of this disease is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen men and eight women with a median age of 45 yr (34-59) were treated with high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation between 1987 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected to undergo intensive therapy because of an estimated short survival (median &lt; 3 yr), even though they had chemosensitive disease and adequate performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had transformed, and the other eleven patients had one or more unfavourable prognostic signs such as advanced stage, bulky disease, multiple relapses, or short remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen has varied over the period, but BEAC (Becenum, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with or without total body irradiation (TBI) was used in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had their stem cells purged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 74 months overall survival was 81% and disease-free survival 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One toxic procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in outcome between patients with a transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared to those without transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients treated with TBI had a significantly worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was also much higher in TBI-treated patients, including four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> (three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study, with the longest follow-up time so far reported, shows a promising 6-yr DFS of 72% in a group of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with a bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The outcome of patients with transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared to historical controls is especially encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is worrying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The role of TBI should be questioned because this and other studies have not shown any advantage of using TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the absence of randomised trials the role of high-dose treatment for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is still not defined </plain></SENT>
