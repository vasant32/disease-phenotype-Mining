<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Rearrangements of any single chromosome in human karyotype have been reported in patients with pMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of aberrations of chromosome 8 in pathogenesis, clinical presentation and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells was carried out by direct method and by means of 24- and/or 48-hour unstimulated cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes were obtained by modified method of HG-bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On presentation, 109 out of 271 successfully karyo-typed patients (40,2%) had abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 22 patients (10.9%) had aberrations of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as "simple" aberration whilst additional three cases had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 included in "complex" karyo-types (&gt; or =3 chromosomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases with constitutional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 mosaicism (CT8M) were excluded using the chromosome analyses of PHA-stimulated blood cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> (seven patients) or deletion of chromosome 8 (two patients) were exclusively found in "complex" karyo-types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During prolonged cytogenetic follow-up, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was not recorded in evolving karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 disappeared in two cases during subsequent cytogenetic studies, i.e. 23 and 72 months from diagnosis, accompanied in one patient with complete hematological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference regarding age, sex, cytopenia, blood and marrow blast count or response to treatment was found between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as the sole aberration compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median survival of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as the sole aberration was 27 months, as compared to 32 months in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics (p = 0.468), whilst median survival of patients with aberrations of chromosome 8 included in "complex" karyotypes was only 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aberrations of chromosome 8 are common in patients with pMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of a clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 is not always the sign of disease progression or poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, in contrast to clones with aberrations of chromosome 8 manifesting the loss of genetic material </plain></SENT>
