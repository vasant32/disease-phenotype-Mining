<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study distribution of some karyotype variants among patients of different age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Distribution of balanced, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, unbalanced, complex and monosomic karyotype among 244 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in age groups 16-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61 and older was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There is difference in frequency of balanced and complex karyotype in patients under and over 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with balanced aberrations including favourable variants t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> after 60 years of age (6.7% versus 15.0% in patients aged 16-20 years; p &lt; 0.001), while a complex karyotype occurs more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients at the age of 61 and older (56.8% versus 2.7% in the group 16-20 years; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With age, more frequently detected is the most unfavourable monosomic karyotype with aberrations similar to those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (57.1% in patients aged 16-60 years and in 80.0% in the group of 61 years of age and over) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age-specific karyotype features detected may be explained by different biological mechanisms involved in leukosogenesis in young and elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
