<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were reviewed to evaluate whether the morphologic criteria proposed by the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group for marrow smears could be applied to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">glycol methacrylate</z:chebi> embedded trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsies and marrow smears were examined separately and then compared for the following parameters: percentage of blasts, dyserythropoiesis, ring sideroblasts, dysmegakaryopoiesis, dysgranulopoiesis, monocytes, cellularity, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and "abnormal localization of immature precursors" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the histologic (biopsies) and cytologic (marrow smears) examinations were in good agreement in 24 of 28 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors' results suggest that the five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> types proposed by the FAB group can be reliably distinguished on bone marrow biopsy with knowledge of the peripheral blood blast and monocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is inadequate, the biopsy can establish diagnosis and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and rules out <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration as possible alternative causes of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
