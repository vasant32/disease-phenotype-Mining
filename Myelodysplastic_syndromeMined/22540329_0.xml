<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AIMS: Failure in mobilization of peripheral blood (PB) stem cells is a frequent reason for not performing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early identification of poor mobilizers could avoid repeated attempts at mobilization, with the administration of pre-emptive rescue mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the first mobilization schedule of 397 patients referred consecutively for autologous HSCT between 2000 and 2010 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor mobilization was defined as the collection of &lt; 2 × 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg body weight (BW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 53 years (range 4-70) and 228 (57%) were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in 133 cases, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 114, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 81, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 42, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> in 17 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mobilization regimen consisted of recombinant human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in 346 patients (87%) and chemotherapy followed by G-CSF (C + G-CSF) in 51 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor mobilization occurred in 105 patients (29%), without differences according to mobilization schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis, previous therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogs and three or more previous chemotherapy lines were predictive factors for poor mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A CD34(+)cell count in PB &gt; 13.8/μL was enough to ensure ≥ 2 × 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg, with high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of poor mobilization was high, being associated with disease type, therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogs and multiple chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The threshold of CD34(+) cell count in PB identified poor mobilizers, in whom the administration of immediate or pre-emptive plerixafor could be useful to avoid a second mobilization </plain></SENT>
