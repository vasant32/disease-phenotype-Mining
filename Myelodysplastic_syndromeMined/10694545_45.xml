<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify predictive factors of survival, relapse, and transplantation-related mortality (TRM) among patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1980 to 1998, 70 patients underwent allogeneic BMT for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 31) or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 39) after prior cytotoxic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had received induction-type chemotherapy before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplantation, there were 24 patients in complete remission (CR) and 46 with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.9 years (range, 1.1 to 18.8 years) after BMT, 16 patients are alive, whereas 19 died of relapse, 34 of TRM, and one of relapse of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated 2-year overall survival, event-free survival, relapse, and TRM rates were 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19% to 40%), 28% (95% CI, 18% to 39%), 42% (95% CI, 26% to 57%), and 49% (95% CI, 36% to 62%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, age greater than 37 years, male sex, positive recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology, absence of CR at BMT, and intensive schedules used for conditioning were associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMT is an effective treatment for patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> who have responsive disease and, in particular, who have no poor-risk cytogenetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The poor results of the other patients, especially those with active disease at BMT, emphasize the need to delineate indications and perform prospective protocols </plain></SENT>
