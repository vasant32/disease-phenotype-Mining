<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on 1 stratum of the study designated for adult subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the study was survival at 180 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included engraftment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, relapse, and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria for malignant and nonmalignant diseases were specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with active central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease, Karnofsky performance status &lt;70%, grade 3 or 4 or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, or suitable related donors were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enrollment required a single cord blood unit containing &gt;10(7) nucleated cells per kilogram of recipient weight and matched at &gt; or =4 HLA-A and -B (low or intermediate resolution) and -DRB1 (high resolution) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four subjects were entered, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 18.2-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most subjects (n = 23) had a 4 of 6 match, 10 subjects had a 5 of 6 match, and 1 subject had a 6 of 6 match </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses at transplantation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 19), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) (n = 1), and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1); 94% were classified as poor risk according to National Marrow Donor Program criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects received total body irradiation/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (n = 27) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>/melphalan (n = 7) conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four subjects died before CBT and are described here but are not included in the main analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rates and median times to neutrophil (500/microL) and platelet (&gt;20,000/microL) engraftment were 0.66 by day 42 (median, 31 days) and 0.35 by day 180 (median, 117 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rate for grade II-IV GVHD was 0.34 by day 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For the primary end point, survival at 180 days, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.46) by day 180 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To date there are 2 survivors, and both are &gt;36 months from enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed by using high-resolution HLA-A and -B typing, which revealed that approximately one third of subjects had 1 or more additional HLA mismatches compared with results of low- or intermediate-resolution HLA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The findings of high treatment-related mortality and slow engraftment kinetics indicate that CBT should continue to be performed in specialized centers with a research focus on cord blood cells </plain></SENT>
