<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Clonal marrow cells from patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand (TRAIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are resistant to TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two isoforms of the Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP) short (FLIPS) and FLIP long (FLIPL), which modulate TRAIL signals, showed disease-stage-dependent differential regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed at characterizing potential differential effects of FLIPL and FLIPS, on TRAIL and TNF-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in model leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using lentiviral constructs, FLIPL and FLIPS, as well as a green fluorescent protein control were overexpressed in ML-1 cells, which constitutively express very low levels of FLIP and are highly sensitive to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells were then exposed to TRAIL or TNF-alpha, and effects on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of FLIP reduced TRAIL and TNF-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ML-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, while FLIPL completely abrogated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, FLIPS allowed for BID cleavage and caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, there was a decline of Bcl-xL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (XIAP) in FLIPS cells followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in TNF-alpha-treated cells resulted in profound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in FLIPS, but not in FLIPL-overexpressing cells, consistent with the observations in patients with early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NF-kappaB had only minimal effects on TRAIL signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, FLIPL and FLIPS exerted differential effects in myeloid leukemic cell lines in response to TRAIL and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It might be possible to therapeutically exploit those differences with effector molecules specific for the FLIP isoforms </plain></SENT>
