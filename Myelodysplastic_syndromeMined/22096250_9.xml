<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 1058 patients with abnormal cytogenetics, 319 (30%) were MK MK(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MK(+) patients were significantly older (P = .0001), had lower white blood counts (P = .0006), and lower percentages of BM blasts (P = .0004); MK was associated with the presence of -5/5q-, -7, 7q-, abnl(12p), abnl(17p), -18/18q-, -20/20q-, inv(3)/t(3;3), complex karyotype (CK), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)-related cytogenetic abnormalities (P &lt; .0001, each); and NPM1 mutations (P &lt; .0001), FLT3 internal tandem duplications (P &lt; .0001), and tyrosine kinase domain mutations (P = .02) were less frequent in MK(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to induction therapy and overall survival in MK(+) patients were dismal with a complete remission rate of 32.5% and a 4-year survival of 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK retained its prognostic impact in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with CK, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related cytogenetic abnormalities, and in a revised definition (MK-R) excluding cases with recurrent genetic abnormalities according to WHO classification and those with derivative chromosomes not leading to true <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In younger patients, allogeneic HSCT from matched related and unrelated donors resulted in a limited improvement of overall survival </plain></SENT>
