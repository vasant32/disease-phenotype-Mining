<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the results of high-dose therapy followed by purged autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients with low-grade follicular non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LGFL), and the prognostic significance of PCR detection of residual Bcl-2/IgH-positive cells after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 1998, 49 patients with LGFL received total body irradiation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> followed by purged ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement was performed at diagnosis, on stem cell collections before and after purging and on bone marrow and blood samples after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 76 months (37-103) 34 patients remain alive and event-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients had disease recurrence, three patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 11 patients died; 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, one because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were 65% (+/-7%) and 77% (+/-6%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved a sustained molecular complete response (CR) had a lower risk of disease recurrence and experienced significantly longer EFS (93% (+/-6%) vs 11% (+/-7%) P=0.0008) and OS (100 vs 55% (+/-12%) P=0.0057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, myeloablative therapy followed by purged ASCT may induce long EFS in patients with LGFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The achievement of sustained molecular CR after ASCT improves EFS and OS </plain></SENT>
