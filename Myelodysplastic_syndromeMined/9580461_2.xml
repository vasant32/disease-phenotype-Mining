<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years particular attention has been paid to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> with dysplastic features or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> that evolve into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to analyze patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased colony forming capacity, in order to see whether or not cell cultures could contribute to the diagnosis of intermediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-MPD</z:e> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80 patients diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CFU-GM assay was performed by plating 1 x 10(5) mononuclear cells/mL in IMDM and 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl-cellulose</z:chebi> containing 10% PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases cultures were run in parallel without PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> to assess autonomous growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cultures were incubated at 37 degrees C in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and scored at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was performed according to standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short-term cultures of 24 and/or 48 hours were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients out of the 80 MDS cases included in the study showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased cell growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these 22 patients, eight were diagnosed as suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) according to the FAB criteria and were excluded from the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 cases, which constitute the body of this study, displayed an increased number of clusters and/or colonies, with an altered cluster/colony ratio (anomalous growth) in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autonomous colony formation was present in five of these 14 cases and autonomous cluster growth was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient showed endogenous BFU-E growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Morphological diagnoses were then revised due to this aberrant colony growth pattern: based on actual criteria, 3 patients could have been considered as having a-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Another 6 cases evolved to a more proliferative disorder: 5 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and one to a-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in 3 of these 6 patients the evolution took place concomitantly with an infectious episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In one additional patient the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet count increased</z:e> up to 1000 x 10(9)/L and required treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that intermediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-MPD</z:e> cases are relatively common and that in vitro characteristics, i.e. high clonogenic capacity with a high cluster/colony ratio and scanty autonomous growth, in patients showing myelodysplastic features could contribute to an early diagnosis in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is possible that in some cases an infectious episode, through higher cytokine secretion, contributes to the development of these disorders </plain></SENT>
