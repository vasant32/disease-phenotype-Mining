<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silver, M.D. and co-chaired by Jerry L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spivak, M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was held from 16 to 18 October 2003 in New York City, New York, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine invited speakers from nine different countries participated in the conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more than 350 attendees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were formal presentations and discussions on biology, clinical aspects, and management of patients with these diverse bone marrow stem cell disorders linked by a variable progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of considerable interest, a clinical symposium exclusively for patients was held the day preceding the meeting at which John Bennett, Tiziano Barbui, Richard Silver, Jerry Spivak, and Ayalew Tefferi spoke on various topics pertaining to these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This proved to be highly informative to the patients who reported that they enjoyed the program immensely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was sponsored by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research &amp; Treatment Fund, Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Representatives of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplasia</z:hpo> Foundation were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This meeting report provides a summary of five different sections prepared by one or more of the session chairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The keynote address was given by Shahin Rafii (Cornell Medical Center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most appropriately, this talk focused on the expression and activation of angiogenic factors which play a crucial role in the progression of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among the known factors, vascular endothelial growth tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGF-R1, R2, and R3) support proliferation, survival, and mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rafii's team has demonstrated that these receptors are expressed on subsets of primary hematopoietic cells as well as leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Some leukemic cells express both VEGF-A and VEGF-R2, resulting in the generation of an autocrine loop that supports survival and within the osteoblastic zone translocating these cells to the vascular enriched niche for receipt of molecular instructions required for proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A pathologic correlation can be seen in some patients with the identification of abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) in the central portions of the medullary cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Misplaced megakaryocytes can release pro-fibrotic factors, including platelet derived growth factors and transforming growth factor-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disregulation of angiogenic factors alter the microenvironment dislocating marrow stem cells that force both proliferation and differentiation in varying degrees, contributing to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
