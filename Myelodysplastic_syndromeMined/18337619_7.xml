<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin plays a protective role in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, whereas leptin may increase the proliferation of progenitor cells and may stimulate leukemic cell growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of adiponectin and leptin levels in the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a preleukemic condition with increasing incidence which has recently been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case-control study, 101 cases with incident, histologically confirmed primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 101 controls matched on gender and age were studied between 2004 and 2007, and blood samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher serum adiponectin levels were associated with lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by bivariate analysis and after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and serum levels of leptin (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the third quartile for leptin levels had a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than controls, and low leptin concentrations were observed in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or good prognostic karyotype after adjusting for age, gender and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating adiponectin and leptin may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to confirm these associations and to explore underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
