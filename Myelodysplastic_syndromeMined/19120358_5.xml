<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An N-terminal-tat and C-terminal histidine-tagged version of hoxb4 (T-hoxb4-H) showed the highest activity in expanding colony forming cells (CFCs) and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) when used at 50 nmol/l concentration in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human cord blood CD34(+) cells cultured with 50 nmol/l T-hoxb4-H showed a significant increase in severe-combined immunodeficient mouse-repopulating cells (SRCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of immune-mediated bone marrow (BM) failure, T-hoxb4-H showed an additive effect with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> in alleviating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, T-hoxb4-H expanded CFC and LTC-IC on BM samples from patients with refractory severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>: after culturing with 50 nmol/l T-hoxb4-H for 4 d, BM cells from 10 of the 11 patients showed increases in CFC and LTC-IC, and the increase in LTC-IC was statistically significant in samples from four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human hoxb4 could be a promising therapeutic agent for BM failure </plain></SENT>
