<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multidimensional flow cytometry employing a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies enables the detection of small numbers of occult leukemic cells that persist during therapy using technology adaptable by most clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective, blinded evaluation of bone marrow specimens obtained from 252 pediatric patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> to determine whether detection of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> defined as more than or equal to 0.5% blasts with aberrant surface antigen expression as determined by flow cytometry was predictive of subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was detected in 41 (16%) of the 252 patients who responded to initial induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In time-dependent multivariate analyses that controlled for allogeneic marrow transplantation, variable intervals between sample submission, age, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, and presence of more than 15% blasts in the marrow after the first course of induction, patients harboring occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were 4.8 times more likely to relapse (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8 to 8.4, P &lt;.0001) and 3.1 times more likely to die (95% CI; 1.9 to 5.1, P &lt;.0001) than those lacking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> detectable by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, flow cytometric evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after the initiation of therapy emerged as the most powerful independent prognostic factor associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients in whom a marrow sample was available for analysis at the end of consolidation therapy, overall survival at 3 years was 41% versus 69% for patients with and without occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, respectively (P =.0058) </plain></SENT>
