<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) histology and immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-MD is currently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMTBs were studied in 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-MD and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> that subsequently transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, six cases showed trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and seven showed bilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to conforming to the WHO definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, documentation of an increased proportion of immature myeloid cells was possible on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and counting of immature cells following immunostaining with CD34, CD117 or HLA-DR antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recognition and quantification of dysplastic features in the haemopoietic lineages was made easier by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to ret40f (glycophorin C), myeloperoxidase, CD61 and/or CD42b, CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on this relatively small series of cases we show the utility of BMTB and immunohistochemistry as an aid to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has to be seen not just in light of its utility at diagnosis, but also the role the diagnostic BMTB would play for purposes of comparison when follow-up BMTBs are submitted in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
