<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene rearrangements in the Ig-JH or the TcR-beta or GM-CSF or IL-3 or MLL gene were detected in 12, 10, 16 and 12% of the cases, respectively, whereas only few cases showed gene rearrangements in the M-bcr (6%) or G-CSF gene (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival of pAML patients with TcR-beta gene rearrangements was longer and survival of pAML patients with IL-3 or GM-CSF gene rearrangement was shorter than in patients without those rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No worse survival outcome was seen in patients with rearrangements in the MLL, Ig-JH or M-bcr gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (CR), clonal gene rearrangements were detected in 23 of 48 cases (48%) if samples were taken once in CR, in 23 of 26 cases (88%) if samples were taken twice in CR and in 23 of 23 cases (100%) if samples were studied three times in CR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that (1) populations with clonal gene rearrangements can be regularly detected at diagnosis, in CR and at relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
