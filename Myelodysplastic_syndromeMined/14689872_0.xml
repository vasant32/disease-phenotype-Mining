<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was performed as early as 3 months after the initial bone marrow transplantation because of rejection and relapse; however, the patient again relapsed 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> resulted in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and the development of high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was then treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, which successfully stabilized these symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After these clinical events, a dramatic hematological response was obtained; the blast rate was reduced from 10.6 to 0% in bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses with X and Y chromosome-specific probes revealed that hematopoietic precursor cells were predominantly of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from the original donor </plain></SENT>
