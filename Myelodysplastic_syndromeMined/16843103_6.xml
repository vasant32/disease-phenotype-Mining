<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a series of 43 consecutive therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) observed for 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This series consisted of 26 women and 17 men, ages ranging from 9 to 85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases were classified into three groups according to the primary diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/ multiplex FISH (M-FISH) methods were used to analyze cytogenetic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The features of chromosomal abnormalities were linked to the nature of the therapy and protocols used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A considerable proportion of recurrent balanced translocations characterized t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH techniques showed that conventional cytogenetics often underestimated associated translocations; some deletions were in fact derivative chromosomes associated with deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath>, there were more complex unbalanced abnormalities than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to other series, recurrent translocations appeared to be more numerous (25%), probably reflecting an evolution of therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
