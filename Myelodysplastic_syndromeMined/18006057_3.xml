<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the immune compartment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show increased surface expression of activation markers (HLA-DR(+), CD57(+), CD28(-), CD62L(-)) on T lymphocytes in blood and bone marrow (n=131) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cell activation was not restricted to any relevant clinical subgroup (FAB, IPSS, cytogenetics) and did not correlate with blood counts or need for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro clonogenic growth of marrow mononuclear cells (n=18) was not influenced by T cells expressing these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, using X-chromosome inactivation analysis (n=12) we demonstrate clonal involvement of NK and B cells in half of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although activated T lymphocytes can be found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, their role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
