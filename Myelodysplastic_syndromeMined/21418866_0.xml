<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases from July 2008 to March 2010 in our hospital and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 17 low-risk and 28 high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38- bone marrow cells and the expressions of stem cell factor receptor (SCF-R), erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors (G-CSFR) and thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) on those cells were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean percentage of CD34+ in karyocyte of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases in high-risk patients [0.53% (0.10%-1.68%)] was significantly higher than that of control group [0.13% (0.08%-0.32%), P&lt;0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean percentages of CD34+CD38+ cells were significantly lower in low and high-risk groups (86.3%±8.5% and 82.6%±11.1%) than those in control group (92.3%±3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And the percentage of CD34+CD38- cells was significantly higher in either low-risk or high-risk group (13.7%±8.5% and 17.4%±11.0%) than that in control group (7.7%±3.4%, both P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control group, the mean percentage of antigen expression of EpoR was significantly lower in CD34+CD38+ cells than that in CD34+CD38- cells (18.7%±18.3% vs 63.6%±20.0%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressions of SCF-R, G-CSFR and TpoR were not significantly different between two cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressions of EpoR on CD34+CD38+ cells of low and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups [9.0% (1.4%-12.7%), 5.2% (1.1%-14.1%)] were significantly lower than those of control group [9.6% (5.1%-30.1%), both P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expressions of G-CSFR on CD34+CD38+ cells of low and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups (29.8%±19.1%, 28.7%±21.1%) were significantly lower than those of control group (44.4%±23.4%, both P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The quantities of EpoR on CD34+CD38- cells of low and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups (42.2%±21.9%, 25.7%±15.6%) were significantly lower than those of control group (63.6%±20.0%, both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TpoR on CD34+CD38- cells of low and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups (5.4%±4.7%, 4.1%±4.0%) were significantly lower than those of control group (10.1%±8.3%, both P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cytopenia with low expression rates of hemopoietic cytokine receptors on CD34+ cells was higher than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with high expression rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The abnormalities of differentiation and membrane hemopoietic cytokine receptors expression of CD34+ bone marrow cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cytopenia and may be useful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
