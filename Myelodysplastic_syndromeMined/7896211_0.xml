<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a case characterized by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After treatment with steroid and anabolic compounds, it evolved into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) as demonstrated by morphological and karyotypic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the dysplastic nature of the disorder, a unique feature was its association with a high platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> could not be clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, the course of the disease was complicated by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> that, together with therapy, could have played some role in stimulating thrombopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can precede or follow a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath>, it is also possible that the platelet elevation in our patient could have been sustained by a primitive thrombocyte disorder </plain></SENT>
