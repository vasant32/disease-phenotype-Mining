<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an agar-liquid double-layer colony assay in which myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> colony-forming cells require the presence of both the lectin PHA and CSF for in vitro proliferation, colony formation of bone marrow cells derived from patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five of 14 MDS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five leukemic transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, colony formation was found to require both PHA and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of these five PHA-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases progressed to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> within 1 year, one progressed from RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and one patient received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PHA-dependent colony formation was associated with higher bone marrow blast counts, but not directly to FAB type or cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases only CSF was required for colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these PHA-independent cases the course of the disease was stable during the observation time (5-17 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two types of colonies were observed in this in vitro system: colonies adherent and colonies nonadherent to the agar underlayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former consisted of terminally differentiated myeloid cells, and the latter comprised immature cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the percentage of adherent colonies formed in vitro may be used as a measure for the maturation defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation was found between the percentage of adherent colonies and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the dependency on PHA for in vitro colony formation of colony-forming cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is predictive for the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the in vitro differentiation capacity has no apparent prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
