<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic engraftment occurred on day 15, and the patient developed systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> after CsA was replaced by FK506 for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory findings and cerebrospinal fluid studies, she was diagnosed as having CsA/FK506-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> with cerebral hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although she recovered completely after discontinuation of FK506, she developed <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> again 15 days after re-administration of FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography scan showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular damage induced by immunosuppressive drugs and enhanced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD seemed to be the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which was present during both of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system events, seemed to have contributed to the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, it is proposed that CsA and FK506 should be reduced or discontinued when patients who have risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> become hypertensive even if they have no symptoms of neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
