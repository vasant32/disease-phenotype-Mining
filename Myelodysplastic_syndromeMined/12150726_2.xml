<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect the methylation pattern of the p15(INK4B) gene and to explore its significance in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) and leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 49 AL cases and 22 MDS cases were analyzed by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) for methylation patterns in CpG islands of the p15(INK4B) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the p15(INK4B) gene was found in 90% (26/29) of newly diagnosed AL, including 46% with complete methylation and 54% with partial methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 evolved AL from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 9 relapsed AL showed a methylated p15(INK4B) gene and the proportion of complete methylation was 67% and 56% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 5 of 11 (45%) AL in remission, including 2 in complete remission (CR) and 3 in partial remission (PR), were partially methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p15(INK4B) gene methylation in newly diagnosed or relapsed AL was significantly higher than that in AL in the remission stage (P = 0.002) p15(INK4B) gene methylation was found in 5 of 13 (38%) low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) patients and 80% of them showed only partial methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, p15(INK4B) gene methylation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 cases in the high-risk group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), including complete methylation in 56%, significantly different from the low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of the p15(INK4B) gene occurs frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is possible that hypermethylation of this gene is related to the pathogenesis and development of AL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be used as a gene marker to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>, relapse of AL and leukemic transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
