<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> present as chimeras associating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> polyclonal and malignant monoclonal progenitors cells in various proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used this technique on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultured hematopoietic progenitors obtained from three patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and exhibiting informative karyotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic cells were cultured for 14 days, and individual clones (BFU-E, CFU-GM) were picked up and then cytocentrifuged for FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used centromeric probes realized and labeled in our laboratory by PCR to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidies</z:mp> for chromosomes 7 and 11 in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we could detect a 5q partial deletion on interphase cells from the third patient using a 5q31 specific probe visualized with the HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set from Boehringer Mannheim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FISH is a helpful method to detect malignant clones in hematopoietic progenitor cultures and hence to study the relative growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vs. leukemic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
