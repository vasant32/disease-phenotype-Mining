<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We identified the telomere length at different hematological phases in 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), showing disease evolution with a conventional Southern blot hybridization using the (TTAGGG)4 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients studied were classified into three groups according to the pattern of telomere length reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group had telomere shortening at the time of disease diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In four of the six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in this group, the disease progressed within 6 months postdiagnosis and each of them survived for less than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in this group four patients showed a 5q anomaly with or without additional changes, and 50% of patients in this group had complex chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients in the second group showed reductions in telomere length after disease progression; two of these three patients showed gradual disease progression and had one or two chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third group comprised the remaining seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; they showed no telomere reduction by disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients in this group experienced rapid disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate that telomere reduction is linked to disease evolution in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, perhaps as a result of genomic instability because patients with complex chromosome abnormalities were clustered in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, because some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients show disease progression without telomere reduction, genetic changes, including point mutations of certain gene(s), may also contribute to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We further noted that telomere shortening at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis might indicate a poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
