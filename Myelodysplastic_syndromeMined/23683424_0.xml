<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 261 MDS patients (143 male and 118 female) with the median age of 52 years (32-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 172 cases were low-risk group (low-risk 104 cases, intermediate-1 68 cases), 89 cases high-risk group (intermediate-2 52 cases, high risk 37 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collections of bone marrow mononuclear cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and extracted the genomic DNA, the methylation status of p15(INK4B) was detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was conducted according to the level of p15(INK4B) methylation in the cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the methylation levels of p15(INK4B) in 58 MDS patients before and after 2 courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> have been assessed with the method of MSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The methylation level of p15(INK4B) in low-risk group patients was significantly lower than that in high-risk group (117.22 vs 157.63, P&lt;0.05 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expected 2-year survival rate of p15(INK4B) methylation positive patients was lower than that of negative ones (91.8% vs 69.8%, P&lt;0.05); the expected 2-year survival rate of p15(INK4B) methylation positive patients was shorter than that of negative ones in low-risk group（78.2% vs 92.0%, P&lt;0.05）, meanwhile there was no significant difference in terms of expected 2-year survival rate and median expected survival between p15(INK4B) methylation positive and negative patients in high-risk group [35.6% vs 38.5%, (17.0±9.3) month vs (18.0±5.7) month, P&gt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed p15(INK4B) methylation degree was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference of overall response (OR) rates were found between p15(INK4B) methylation positive patients and negative patients before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>（65.9% vs 76.5%, P&gt;0.05）, and complete remission (CR) rates between these two groups also showed no statistical difference（22.0% vs 29.4%, P&gt;0.05） </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p15(INK4B) methylation levels had no obvious change before and after treatment in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> responders（P&gt;0.05） </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The survival of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with positive p15(INK4B) methylation was comparatively shorter, but p15(INK4B) methylation had no influence on response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
