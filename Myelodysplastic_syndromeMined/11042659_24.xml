<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probability of remaining in CR at 3 years was 82% in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, but 0% in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 7% in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 0% with ALL and 33% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A leukocyte dose of 5 x 107/kg of recipient body weight appeared to be optimal as an initial dose of DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the relatively low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and the similar GVL effect, DLI may be more beneficial to patients in Japan with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than to those in Western countries </plain></SENT>
