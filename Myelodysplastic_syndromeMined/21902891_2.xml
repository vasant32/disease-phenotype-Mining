<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate whether serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are associated with prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is based on 105 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammapathies</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid disorders), seen over a 6-months period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>25(OH)D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/ml) appeared very common and an inverse relationship was observed between 25(OH)D levels and the response to therapy: lower levels being related to poorer response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, a significant difference was noted between patients with long-term disease-free survival in those tested at diagnosis (P=0·001) or in those tested at the time of relapse (P=0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly in patients with Philadelphia-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, there was a correlation between molecular response and levels of 25(OH)D (P=0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previously identified factors, such as age, season, gender, or nutritional index, were not related to circulating 25(OH)D levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of circulating 25(OH)D appeared related to a progressive stage of the disease and poor response to therapy, and, therefore, to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is a potential marker of prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
