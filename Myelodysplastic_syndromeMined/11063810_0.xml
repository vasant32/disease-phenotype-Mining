<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a 26-year-old patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial bone marrow cytogenetics with G-banding showed a rearranged chromosome 21, which was dicentric and bisatellited on CBG- and NOR-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization helped to characterize the structure, using a whole chromosome 21 paint and the locus specific AML1 gene probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rearranged 21 consisted solely of chromosome 21 material, contained only one copy of AML1, and was not a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>, but a deleted tandem translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and the patient died almost 12 months post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics was performed three times during the course of the disease, and the dicentric chromosome 21 was present throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there are a number of published rearrangements of chromosome 21 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, most are isodicentrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not find another case of an abnormal chromosome 21 with the same structure as reported here </plain></SENT>
