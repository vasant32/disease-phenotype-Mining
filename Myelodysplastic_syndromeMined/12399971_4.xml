<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the percentages and absolute numbers of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and NK cell subsets in cryopreserved samples of either bone marrow or blood non-T cell-depleted allogeneic MHC-matched hematopoietic grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, we found higher numbers of NK cells in aphereses than in bone marrow collections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the distribution of NK cell subsets, defined by the cell surface expression of MHC class I-specific receptors, in these allogeneic grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of NK cell subsets from the two different origins were similar, with the exception of the CD158a/h(+) NK cell subset, whose size appeared to be smaller in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The search for relations between the numbers of infused cells and post-transplantation events demonstrated that increasing numbers of infused T cells but not NK cells are related with decreased overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights the toxicity of infused T cells but not NK cells in allogeneic MHC-matched hematopoietic grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data pave the way for further trials to investigate the effect of NK cell infusion in MHC-matched allogeneic transplantation, and in particular whether ex vivo NK cell expansion and activation may enhance the anti-tumoral effect of the procedure and decrease its morbidity </plain></SENT>
