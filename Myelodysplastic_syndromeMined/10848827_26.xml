<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that a combination treatment with rhEPO plus recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) given for up to 18 weeks may result in a higher erythroid response rate than with rhEPO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential advantage of an even more prolonged schedule of combined rhG-CSF and rhEPO treatment to obtain and maintain stable responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study, 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [17 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), eight with RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), eight with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) with bone marrow blast counts less than 20%] were scheduled to receive at least 36 weeks of combined therapy with rhG-CSF and rhEPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 28 evaluable patients demonstrated an erythroid response [61%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 41-78] after 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The erythroid response rate was 80% (20 of 25 evaluable patients; 95% CI 59-93) after 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of these responses developed between week 12 and week 36, whereas two initially responding patients became refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytokine therapy was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 20 patients responding after 36 weeks continued to be treated with both cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 1 year and 2 years of continuous combined treatment, 50% of the initially included patients showed a continuing response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a prolonged combination treatment with rhG-CSF and rhEPO is highly effective in achieving a stable and long-lasting erythroid response in many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and low blast count </plain></SENT>
