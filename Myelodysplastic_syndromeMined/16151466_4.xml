<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 180 evaluable patients with a median age of 65 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, n = 107) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (RAEBt, n = 73) were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no differences among the three treatment regimens with respect to numbers of courses applied or treatment delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in approximately 40% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arms, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates were higher in the granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- or IL3-containing arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 38.6% with no statistically significant difference among the three arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, a substantial proportion of patients had achieved relatively durable responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No influence of either growth factor was detected on the grade of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
