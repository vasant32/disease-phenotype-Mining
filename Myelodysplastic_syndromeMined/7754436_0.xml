<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess if the in vitro behaviour of leukaemic colony-forming units (CFU-L) from secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> is similar to that of the de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An attempt was also made to verify if such behaviour correlated with the characteristics of the disease or with the cell-surface markers of the leukaemic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 21 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (12 had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-AL, and 9 had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloproliferative syndromes, MPS-AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononucleated cells were cultured on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl-cellulose</z:chebi> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dishes were examined after 7 days of incubation in humid 37 degrees C environment with 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct or indirect immunofluorescence was used for the immunophenotypic analysis and the patients were divided in two groups: 1) immature phenotype, which include those cases expressing only precursor (CD34) or pan-myeloid (CD33/13) antigens, and (2) mature phenotype, comprising the caes with granulomonocytic (CD15, CD14), erythroid (glycophorin) or megakaryocytic (CD61) differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was done with the BMDP programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Up to 95% of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> proliferate in vitro, as opposed to 82% of the de novo ones, the difference not being significant (p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful cell showing was clearly superior in the former (p = 0.02), mostly due to higher proliferation of the MPS-AL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither the clinico-biologic characteristics of the patients nor the phenotype of the blast cells correlated with the in vitro behaviour of CFU-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only CD19 antigen expression and nuclear TdT provided a lesser in vitro growth (p = 0.05 and p-0.06, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In general terms, secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, especially MPS-AL, show higher in vitro growth than de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
