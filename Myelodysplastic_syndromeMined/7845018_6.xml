<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency of Evi-1 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a disorder with altered proliferation and differentiation in the erythroid and myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal expression was found in 1/9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and in 7/12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or in transformation (RAEBt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation could be found between expression of Evi-1 and age, sex, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and percentage of bone marrow blasts or erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the high incidence of Evi-1 expression which remains at low levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and RAEBt is not a major determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> and myelopoiesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
