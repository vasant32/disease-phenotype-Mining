<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug, FDA-approved for the treatment of the 5q-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and refractory or relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regarding the treatment of MM, there have been published cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary toxicity for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> and the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide; only 1 case of lenalidomide-induced pulmonary toxicity has been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: In our manuscript, we describe the clinical course and diagnostic workup of a 66-year-old male patient with MM on lenalidomide with signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic workup resulted in the diagnosis of drug-induced interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0006516'>hypersensitivity pneumonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the frequently reported pulmonary infectious complications in patients treated with lenalidomide and a possibly underreported rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, we advocate a more aggressive pulmonary workup for patients with pulmonary symptoms </plain></SENT>
