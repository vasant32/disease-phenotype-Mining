<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Marrow progenitor cell recovery was assessed for up to 4 years in 227 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients were treated for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 127 by peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marrow progenitor cell counts were decreased for several years with both bone marrow and peripheral blood grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were not different according to the origin of the graft, despite the reduced duration of peripheral blood cell recovery observed after PBPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used for PB graft mobilization and after transplantation resulted in faster neutrophil recovery compared to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with no evidence of decreased marrow progenitor cell recoveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, postgraft administration of GM-CSF enhanced long-term colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage reconstitution only after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors that influenced marrow progenitor cell reconstitution have been identified by univariate and multivariate analysis: age, gender, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and postgraft administration of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) for the whole patient group; gender, graft progenitor cell yields, and type of HGF (G-CSF vs GM-CSF) for the PBPCT group; and only type of HGF for the BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite faster peripheral blood cell recovery, persistent deficiency of marrow progenitor cells was found several years after PBPCT, as observed after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-CSF-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster neutrophil recovery compared to GM-CSF mobilization, with no difference in long-term hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
