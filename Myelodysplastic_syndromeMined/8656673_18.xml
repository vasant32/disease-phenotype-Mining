<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 is a transforming gene originally identified in a common integration site of murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> retrovirus and mapped in human chromosome 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not normally expressed in either human or murine hematopoietic cells, but is overexpressed in retrovirus-induced murine myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> as well as human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with 3q26 abnormalities, and thus thought to be responsible for both human and murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, possible involvement of the Evi-1 gene in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> was evaluated by Northern blot analysis in a total of 73 patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that increased expression of the Evi-1 gene was most frequently observed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in blastic crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found in 10 of 14 (71.0%) samples from <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in blastic crisis, three of 15 (20.0%) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, three of 11 (27.3%) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and one of 11 (9.1%) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients showing increased Evi-1 expression, none of 17 informative patients showed cytogenetic abnormalities involving 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Southern blot analysis revealed neither amplification nor rearrangements of the Evi-1 gene in 11 Evi-1-positive patients whose DNA samples were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that increased expression of the Evi-1 gene may play an important role in development of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, especially in progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase to blastic crisis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> even without 3q26 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
