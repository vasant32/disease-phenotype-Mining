<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old male patient with 27% of blasts in the peripheral blood underwent hematological examinations including cytochemical staining of cells such as myeloperoxydase (MPO), surface marker study on blasts, chromosomal test and bcr-abl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytological and molecular findings (MPO-positive, myeloid marker CD13 expression (67.3%) and megakaryocytic marker CD41 expression (24.8%)) indicated that the blasts were consistent with myeloid leukemic cells partially committed to megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having leukemic transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e> based on history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, isolated i(17q), bcr-abl negative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, increased eosinophil/basophil count and cytologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity of BMI-1 in CD34+ blasts was 25.8% at the diagnosis and anti-leukemic drugs including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> were effective for his disease control during 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the CD34+ cells turned out to highly express BMI-1 (83.1%), and leukemic cells started to increase progressively following which the leukemic cells failed to respond efficiently to any anti-leukemic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of BMI-1 was well correlated with the disease progression, growth ability of blasts and resistance to anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs, indicating that BMI-1 positivity in CD34+blasts is an excellent molecular marker for disease progression and prognosis in such patients </plain></SENT>
