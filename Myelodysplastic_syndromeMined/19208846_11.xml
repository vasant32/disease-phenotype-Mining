<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EVI1 is an oncogene inappropriately expressed in the bone marrow (BM) of approximately 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease is characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and multilineage myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> that are thought to be a major cause of mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We earlier reported on a mouse model that constitutive expression of EVI1 in the BM led to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, as observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and we subsequently showed that EVI1 interaction with GATA1 blocks proper erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas this interaction could provide the basis for the erythroid defects in EVI1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it does not explain the alteration of myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have examined the expression of several genes activated during terminal myelopoiesis in BM cells and identified a group of them that are altered by EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these genes is their regulation by the transcription factor PU.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report here that EVI1 interacts with PU.1 and represses the PU.1-dependent activation of a myeloid promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EVI1 does not seem to inhibit PU.1 binding to DNA, but rather to block its association with the coactivator c-Jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After mapping the PU.1-EVI1 interaction sites, we show that an EVI1 point mutant, unable to bind PU.1, restores the activation of PU.1-regulated genes and allows a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation of BM progenitors in vitro </plain></SENT>
