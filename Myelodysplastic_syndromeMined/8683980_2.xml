<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have utilized the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay to measure the metabolic activity of cells from the bone marrow of 55 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and non-clonal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doubling dilutions of cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> for 3-4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean optical density of the formazan produced by each cell dilution was plotted and the gradient of the line produced was calculated, higher gradients indicating more metabolically active cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the median activity of mononuclear cells from seven patients with non-clonal disease was 0.202 (range 0.175-0.253); blast cells from 27 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had a median activity of 0.187 (range 0.079-0.345) and 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> a median of 0.155 (range 0.062-0.311) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven assays on mononuclear cells from five patients in remission had a median activity of 0.203 (range 0.190-0.248), indicating no significant difference between these and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the metabolic activity of cells when compared with their proliferative capacity, cell size and expression of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following exposure of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients' blast cells to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, 6-thioguanine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, cell survival was measured using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While there was no correlation between the in vitro sensitivity of these cells to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, less metabolically active cells showed significantly greater sensitivity to 6-thioguanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the more active cells appeared to be more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients whose blasts cells showed higher metabolic activity appeared to achieve remission and had a longer mean survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, by using a simple technique we were able to establish that some patients were more likely to respond to certain cytotoxic regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary study reflected the multifactorial nature of clinical response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, so providing further information on the relationship between cellular metabolic activity and treatment failure </plain></SENT>
