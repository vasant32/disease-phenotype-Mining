<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the risk of acquiring a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with age, the aim of this study was to quantify <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferases (CPT1 and CPT2), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CRAT), human specific microsomal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>, and OCTN2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporter) in mononuclear cells of healthy humans of different age groups and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR we compared <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis of the above mentioned enzymes in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of 23 healthy persons (mean age 45 years), 9 blood and 22 bone marrow samples of 31 MDS patients with varying proportions of apoptotic cells (mean age 78 years), and blood samples of 30 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to younger adults, there was a 50% downregulation of CPT1 in elderly persons and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction in CRAT, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> 2, and OCTN2 was more than 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction in microsomal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> was more pronounced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in age-matched controls (96% vs. 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow cells there was a negative correlation of CPT1 and CRAT with the relative proportion of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> values were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The described reduction in transcription of different genes in blood cells which is well known in different tissues may reflect a systemic signaling process, associated with aging, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
