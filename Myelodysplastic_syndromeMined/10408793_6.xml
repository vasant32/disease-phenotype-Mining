<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CC may be hampered by insufficient metaphase preparation and cannot analyze interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These problems are solved by using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CGH was applied to samples from 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the results were compared with CC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CC detected aberrations in 12 of 45 samples, including chromosomes 3 (n = 1), 5 (n = 9), 7 (n = 2),8(n = 1), 18(n = 1),21 (n = 1), X (n = 1), and Y(n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, loss of B and C group chromosomes and a marker chromosome were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CGH revealed chromosomal imbalances in 18 of 45 samples, including chromosomes 5 (n = 11), 7 (n = 2), 8 (n = 1), 18(n = 1), 20(n = 1), 21 (n = 1), X (n = 1), and Y (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> unbalanced aberrations found by CC were detected by CGH, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the CGH found additional aberrations and redefined the aberrations of the chromosomes of the B and C group in one sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FISH confirmed these aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally performed FISH for chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 gave <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in CC and CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CGH and FISH confirmed the results obtained by CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three techniques showed changes of chromosomes 5 and 7 as the most frequent aberrations, emphasizing the importance of these chromosomes in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CC is proven as the basic technique for cytogenetic evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
