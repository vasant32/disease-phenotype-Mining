<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is marked by gradually worsening cytopenias and a variable risk for the eventual transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increases with age, and disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before 50 years is unusual </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of these subtypes has specific prognostic and morphologic and/or cytogenetic features which make it unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was developed to aid in determining the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; this system categorizes patients into four risk groups for both overall survival and transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is based on the goal of controlling cytopenia-related symptoms, improving survival, improving quality of life, and decreasing risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies include supportive care, iron chelation, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors,immunosuppressive therapies including lenalidomide, antithymocyte globulin, chemotherapy (eg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, low-dose Ara-C, 7+3 chemotherapy), and stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
