<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The i(17q) hence plays a presumably important pathogenetic role both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This notwithstanding, the molecular consequences of this abnormality have not been investigated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed 21 hematologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (8 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>, 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>], 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>) with i(17q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig, derived from the short arm of chromosome 17, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were shown to have a breakpoint in 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases, the breaks occurred within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS)</z:e> common deletion region in 17p11, a gene-rich region which is genetically unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 of these 12 cases, we were able to further map the breakpoints to specific markers localized within a single YAC clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six other cases showed breakpoints located proximally to the SMS common deletion region, but still within 17p11, and yet another case had a breakpoint distal to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using chromosome 17 centromere-specific probes, it could be shown that the majority of the i(17q) chromosomes (11 of 15 investigated cases) were dicentric, ie, they contained two centromeres, strongly suggesting that i(17q) is formed through an intrachromosomal recombination event, and also implicating that the i(17q), in a formal sense, should be designated idic(17)(p11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because i(17q) formation results in loss of 17p material, potentially uncovering the effect of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor on the remaining 17p, the occurrence of TP53 mutations was studied in 17 cases by sequencing the entire coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases, no TP53 mutations were found, whereas one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> displayed a homozygous deletion of TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest that there is no association between i(17q) and coding TP53 mutations, and that another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene(s), located in proximity of the SMS common deletion region, or in a more distal location, is of pathogenetic importance in i(17q)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
