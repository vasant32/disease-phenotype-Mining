<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated molecular detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as a diagnostic method to detect del(5q) in a series of 60 MDS cases at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LOH was compared to cytogenetics on the same clinical specimen, resolving ambiguous cases by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and additional LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was poor concordance between molecular and cytogenetic results, but most discrepancies could be resolved by FISH and additional LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis was of low sensitivity because most cases contained a relatively high proportion of cells without del(5q), but it was accurate, while cytogenetics overestimated the proportion of cells with del(5q) and failed to detect some cases with complex rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minor clones were detected both by FISH and LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found an incidence of 23% (14 of 60 cases) for del(5q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that there is a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the cellular population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although del(5q) is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it may not be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells, leading to diagnostic challenges </plain></SENT>
