<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed erythroid response to erythropoetin (EPO) or darbepoetin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e>) and thalidomide in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with 5q deletion treated by French centers (GFM) and in whom karyotype was successfully performed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 46% (31% major, 15% minor) according to International Working Group (IWG) 2000 criteria versus 64% in patients without 5q deletion (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to IWG 2006 criteria, the response rate in patients with 5q deletion was 39% versus 52% in patients without 5q deletion (p=0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of response was 14 months versus 25 months (IWG 2000) and 13 months versus 27 months (IWG 2006) in 5q deletion and non-5q deletion patients (p=0.019 and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 120 MDS treated with thalidomide, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had successful cytogenetic analysis, 37% of the 24 patients with 5q deletion responded (IWG 2000 criteria, 20% major, 17% minor) with a mean duration of 9.5 months, versus 32% (18% major, 14% minor) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without 5q deletion and a mean response duration of 9 months (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that response rates to EPO or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> and thalidomide are clearly inferior to those obtained with lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
