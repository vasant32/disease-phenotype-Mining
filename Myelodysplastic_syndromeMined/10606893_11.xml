<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared the phenotypic and functional characteristics of dendritic cells (DC) generated in vitro from the peripheral blood mononuclear fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients (four refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, four refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts) with DCs generated in a similar way from eight healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 10 d of culture in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, reduced numbers and percentages of DCs were obtained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> DCs exhibited significantly lower expression of CD1a, CD54, CD80 and MHC class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ability to stimulate T lymphocytes in an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction was reduced in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> DCs also showed a reduced receptor-mediated endocytosis as demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> DCs have the same cytogenetic abnormality of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together these findings indicate that, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, DCs are part of the malignant clone and exhibit a deficient antigen uptake and presentation </plain></SENT>
