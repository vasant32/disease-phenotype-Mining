<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIST) for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> not in remission, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 132 patients (89 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 40 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 3 others) who received conventional myeloablative HCT (CST, n=52) or RIST (n=80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of the RIST group was significantly higher than that of the CST group (53 years versus 40 years, P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RIST group also included a higher proportion of patients with an HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) of 1 or more than the CST group (65% versus 37%, P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of achieving complete remission and the incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) in the CST and RIST groups were, respectively, 77% and 64%, 50% and 50%, and 23% and 28%, with no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no difference in the 2-year probabilities of nonrelapse mortality (NRM, 36% and 38%), progressive disease or relapse (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> 51% and 49%), overall survival (OS, 31% and 38%), and progression-free survival (PFS, 28% and 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses revealed that a higher HCT-CI score and transplant from donors other than HLA-matched relatives were associated with increased risks of NRM and poor OS, and patients who received chemotherapy within 2 months before HCT were associated with increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, poor OS, and PFS after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for these variables, the risks of NRM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, OS, and PFS in the RIST group were not significantly different from those in the CST group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that the antileukemia/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect associated with RIST is comparable to that associated with CST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIST appears to be feasible for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> not in remission </plain></SENT>
