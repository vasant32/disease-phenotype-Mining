<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel approach has been used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>: induction of the leukemic cells to undergo terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on its in vitro ability to induce differentiation in several myeloid leukemic cell lines, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) has been applied clinically in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid and promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have determined in detail the ability of RA to induce expression of granulocytic functions in a human promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) and compared it with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several granulocytic characteristics (phagocytosis, surface adherence and generation of free radicals in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol-ester</z:chebi>) were induced to the same degree by both agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophil functions, including lysozyme accumulation, spontaneous migration, chemotactic activity toward zymosan-activated serum (containing C5a), the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>) and spontaneous motility in semi-solid medium were induced by DMSO, but they were absent or incompletely expressed in RA-induced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only RA induced migration toward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous treatment with RA and DMSO proved synergistic with respect to morphological maturation and several functions (e.g. <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction), but complementary stimulation of other activities (e.g. chemotaxis, lysozyme content) could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, characteristics induced by DMSO (i.e., expression of C5a and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> receptors and accumulation of lysozyme) were inhibited by the addition of RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
