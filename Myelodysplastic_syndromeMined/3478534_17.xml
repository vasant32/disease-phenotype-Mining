<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interferon has been reported to have differentiation promoting effects in certain model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of this and other potentially beneficial effects, a trial of recombinant alpha 2 interferon was undertaken in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 14 patients, subclassified as two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), one RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), nine RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The planned dosage schedule was 2.0 MU/M2 t.i.w. sc x 2 weeks q 4 weeks for at least two cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patient achieved the prospective remission criteria, which included sustained blood count improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient improvements of platelet counts of greater than 50% in baseline were noted in six patients, and a transient antileukemic effect was noted in one patient with CMMoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients were found to be sensitive to the count suppressing effects of alpha 2 interferon with greater than 25% suppression of granulocytes, platelets, or reticulocytes transiently noted in 11 patients and decreasing bone marrow cellularity noted in two while on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of these effects, dosage adjustments were frequently instituted in the RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average dosages and durations of treatment received were thus 1.48 MU/M2 x 19.4 injections for patients with RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and 2.25 MU/M2 x 27 injections for the CMMoL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation was noted in five patients, and increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> was noted in one CMMoL patient while on protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It cannot be determined at this time whether these transformations were accelerated by alpha 2 interferon or represent selection bias in this study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although some evidence of beneficial effects was noted, alpha 2 interferon in this dosage and schedule is not a useful treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
