<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification is a rare phenomenon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, but recently amplification of specific chromosome bands containing genes rearranged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific balanced chromosome translocations has been reported in a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detected duplication or amplification of chromosome band 11q23 with 3-7 copies of the MLL gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 12 out of 70 unselected patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case, the supernumerary copies of MLL were located to previously unidentified marker chromosomes or unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 of the 12 patients, 2-6 copies were located together on the same chromosome arm representing amplification, 7 patients had single, extra duplicated copies of MLL, whereas both amplification and duplication were observed in the same cell in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated gain of varying, often large parts of 11q in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MLL gene was shown to be unrearranged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven out of eight patients with duplication or amplification of MLL had mutations of TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with supernumerary copies of MLL were in general older (P = 0.007) and had a shorter survival (P &lt; 0.001) compared to other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duplication or amplification of MLL was significantly associated with a complex karyotype (P = 0.002), with deletion or loss of 5q (P = 0.001), and with prior therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the existence of a specific genetic pathway in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with many previously unidentified chromosome aberrations demonstrated to represent extra copies of parts of 11q, including the unrearranged MLL gene </plain></SENT>
