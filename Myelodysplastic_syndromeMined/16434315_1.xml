<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, among the 1,110 various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> analyzed during the past seven years, 27 (2.4%) patients had karyotypically unrelated clones: 3.5% (7/202) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo>, 5.3% (11/206) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, none of 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, 0.4% (1/233) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, and 2.6% (8/306) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> with clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients showed two unrelated clones and two had three unrelated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most consistent chromosome abnormalities were del(5q) (seven cases), +8 (six cases), del(20q) (five cases), and del(7q), +12, +21, and -22 (three cases each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of interest, the high frequency of different numeric or structural abnormalities affecting the same chromosomes in such clones supports the hypothesis that these karyotypically unrelated clones originate from the common malignant clone through submicroscopic molecular genetic changes and evolutionary processes </plain></SENT>
