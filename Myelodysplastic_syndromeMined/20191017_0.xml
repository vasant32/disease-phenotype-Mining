<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine hundred one patients who underwent medical treatment for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> and 40,543 patients who visited the emergency room and without malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> were divided into two groups depending on their primary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, CLL) for which chemotherapy and steroid therapy was necessary, and group II included patients with anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and who had undergone repeated transfusion for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between the two groups in respect to the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005360'>urolithiasis</z:mp> and the stones' radiopacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty nine patients (3.2%) of the 901 malignant hematologic patients were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0005360'>urolithiasis</z:mp>, compared to 575 patients (1.4%) of 40,543 emergency room patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase of the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005360'>urolithiasis</z:mp> in the malignant hematologic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the general patients, the patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> had a higher rate of radiolucent stones (46.6% versus 16.3%, respectively), and the difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005360'>urolithiasis</z:mp> for malignant hematologic patients was significantly higher than that for the control group </plain></SENT>
