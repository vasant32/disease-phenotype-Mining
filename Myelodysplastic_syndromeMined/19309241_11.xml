<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, we evaluated the safety and efficiency of donor-expanded MSC infusion after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in six patients with poor hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs were infused without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> and without conditioning at a dose of 1 x 10(6)/kg weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients displayed rapid hematopoietic recovery (days 12 and 21), and four patients showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two patients who showed hematopoietic recovery were in first complete remission (CR1) compared to the other heavily pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no toxic side effects linked to MSC infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation 12 days following the MSC infusion and died from CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that infusion of MSCs without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> co-infusion can restore medullary function in some patients with poor hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that patients with a less damaged stroma could benefit from this approach </plain></SENT>
