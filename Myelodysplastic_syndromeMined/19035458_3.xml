<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (FeLV) clone33 was obtained from a domestic cat with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long terminal repeat (LTR) of this virus, like the LTRs present in FeLV from other cats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, differs from the LTRs of other known FeLV in that it has 3 tandem direct 47-bp repeats in the upstream region of the enhancer (URE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we injected cats with FeLV clone33 and found 41% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias and dysplastic changes in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the cats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> eventually developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow of the majority of cats with FeLV clone33 induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> produced fewer erythroid and myeloid colonies upon being cultured with erythropoietin or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF) than bone marrow from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the bone marrow of some of the cats expressed high-levels of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes TNF-alpha and survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the proviral sequences obtained from 13 cats with naturally occurring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> reveal they also bear the characteristic URE repeats seen in the LTR of FeLV clone33 and other proviruses from cats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletions and mutations within the enhancer elements are frequently observed in naturally occurring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that FeLV variants that bear URE repeats in their LTR strongly associate with the induction of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in cats </plain></SENT>
