<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients receiving myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and focused on prognostic factors affecting the long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the French-American-British classification and the HCT-comorbidity index was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">Cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> or thiotepa combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation was used as myeloablative conditioning in eight and 23 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up period of 0.8-14.2 years from transplantation (median: 6.4 years), 23 patients were alive in complete remission, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 79% and 72% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 22% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, &gt; or =20% blasts in the bone marrow and an HCT-comorbidity score &gt; or = 3 were significantly associated with poor OS and DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high HCT-comorbidity score and male patients receiving transplantation from female donors were significantly more likely to have a higher NRM according to the univariate, but not the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that comorbidity and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at the time of transplantation may be useful variables for predicting the outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients receiving myeloablative HCT </plain></SENT>
