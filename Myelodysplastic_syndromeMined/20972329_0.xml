<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While much has been recently learned about the cause of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the pathogenesis of true <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (i.e., low bone marrow cellularity and low counts in multiple blood lineages) has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this issue of the JCI, Chen et al. present evidence that overactivation of mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> signaling in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> is found in two mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, and they show that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> significantly normalizes the low blood counts </plain></SENT>
