<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) comprise a group of pathologically and cytogenetically distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, including their pathological and prognostic classifications, cytopenias, transfusion and supportive care needs, and treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe these characteristics in a large group of recently diagnosed and existing (ie, established) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted six consecutive cross-sectional surveys among US hematology and medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> specialists (identified from an American Medical Association [AMA] database of physicians who administer chemotherapy) between June 2005 and January 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire collected data on the characteristics and treatment patterns of the 4-10 most recently seen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients for each physician, including demographic data, transfusion needs, treatment approaches, and consideration for clinical trials or bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A panel of 101 physicians who were geographically representative of physicians registered with the AMA characterized 614-827 patients per survey, for a total of 4514 responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among recently diagnosed patients, 55% were male (95% confidence interval [CI] = 52% to 59%), the median age at diagnosis was 71 years (range = 65-80 years), and 10% (95% CI = 8% to 12%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> secondary to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or environmental exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in established patients ranged from 13 to 16 months over the six surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among recently diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, fewer patients with lower-risk disease than with higher-risk disease were dependent on either red blood cell transfusions (22% vs 68%) or platelet transfusions (6% vs 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed and established patients used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A small percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients either had had or were being considered for bone marrow transplantation (recently diagnosed: 4%; established: 4% or less) or were being treated on clinical trials (recently diagnosed: 1%; established: 4% or less) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in the United States have substantial transfusion needs, and use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and are seldom considered for bone marrow transplantation or clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data may be useful in characterizing the health care resource use and pharmacoeconomic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the United States </plain></SENT>
