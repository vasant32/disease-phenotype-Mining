<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the pattern of differentiation and response to growth factors in six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with well-defined cytogenetic abnormalities by means of conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow cells were grown in stroma-free liquid cultures in the presence of SCF, IL-3, IL-6 and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IN three cases a CFU-GM expansion comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was observed, together with a decrease or increase of cells with abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases showed no response to growth factor stimulation, morphological signs of terminal myeloid differentiation and increase (one case) or decrease (one case) in the percentage of abnormal FISH signals along the cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one additional case, while CFU-C expansion was present, clearcut leukemic transformation was observed in the culture, together with a sharp decrease in the percentage of abnormal FISH signals, indicating a leukemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that FISH analysis is generally a poor indicator of clonality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; nevertheless, determining the kinetics of cytogenetically abnormal clones in liquid bone marrow cultures may provide insight as to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormalities</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells and may be useful prior to in vivo growth factor administration </plain></SENT>
