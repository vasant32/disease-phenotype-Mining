<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations of the N-ras gene occur at relatively high frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of activated N-ras in primary hematopoietic cells and myeloid cell lines (in some cases) can lead to inhibition of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of mutant N-ras in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is sufficient to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, but these pathologies occur with long latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that mutations that disable the growth suppressive properties of N-ras in hematopoietic cells are required for the development of frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present work, the growth suppression induced by a mutant N-ras gene in U937 myeloid cells was used as the basis to screen a retroviral cDNA library for genes that prevent mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression (i.e., putative cooperating oncogenes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This screen identified the gene for the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), and as confirmation of the screen, overexpression of this gene in U937 cells was shown to inhibit mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also recovered from the screen were two truncated clones of an uncharacterized gene (interim official symbol: PP2135) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of this truncated PP2135 gene in U937 cells did not appear to abrogate mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression, but rather appeared to confer an increased sensitivity of U937 cells to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e>, accounting for the recovery of this gene from the genetic screen </plain></SENT>
