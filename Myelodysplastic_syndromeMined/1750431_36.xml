<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Systemic mast cell disease</z:e> (SMCD) follows an indolent course in most patients, but a significant number of patients die of neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reviews of the literature and retrospective studies in a single institution have defined features that may be associated with a poor prognosis, but prospective studies have been lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we prospectively analyzed the relationship between clinical, laboratory, and hematopathologic findings and clinical outcome in a series of 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mast cell disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This analysis was employed to both define clinically useful prognostic variables and describe the histologic evolution of bone marrow mast cell infiltration and its relationship to hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six adult patients were referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with clinical and/or pathologic evidence of mast cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had bone marrow examinations, and 10 patients underwent serial bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of SMCD required pathologic documentation of bone marrow mast cell infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for up to 13 years at the NIH (up to 30 years after the initial pathologic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mast cell disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis defined the correlation between variables and the presence of diagnostic bone marrow lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and the effects of various variables on the survival time were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two of 46 patients (74%) had a bone marrow biopsy diagnostic for SMCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients were considered to have cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mast cell disease</z:e> (CMCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, alkaline phosphatase level, absolute lymphocyte count, and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms were positively correlated with SMCD, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was negatively associated with diagnostic bone marrow lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With multivariate analysis, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and absolute lymphocyte count remained as significant independent predictors of bone marrow findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No CMCD patient died or had significant clinical deterioration in the 1- to 30-year period of follow-up (median = 8.5 years), whereas 10 of 32 SMCD patients (31%) died from 1 to 22 years after diagnosis (median = 2.5 years) (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed the following variables as significantly increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with SMCD: later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, absence of cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, bone marrow hypercellularity, qualitative peripheral blood smear abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003155'>elevated alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> level, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that only the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and LDH levels were significant independent predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 10 SMCD patients who died had myeloproliferative or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our prospective study has defined a number of important variables in patients with clinical evidence of mast cell proliferation that can predict both the presence of SMCD and the likelihood of fatal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Since recent evidence suggests that mast cells derive from a bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor, SMCD may represent a myeloproliferative condition with the propensity to evolve into a neoplastic granulocytic disorder in a significant minority of patients </plain></SENT>
