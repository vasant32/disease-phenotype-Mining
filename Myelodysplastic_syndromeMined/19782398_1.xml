<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pyrosequencing of 11 consecutive CpG sites of the p15INK4b promotor region was performed, with the extent of CpG <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> methylation assessed in terms of methylation level (MtL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with &gt;5% bone marrow blasts had higher MtL than patients with &lt;5% blasts (10.1% vs. 6.1%, p=0.030, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation was not associated with chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MtL of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were higher than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (11.2% vs. 6.2%, p=0.036, respectively); they were higher in patients with cytopenias in &gt; or =2 lineages than in patients with either unilineage or no cytopenia (9.8% vs. 4.1%, p=0.036, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients with &gt;7% MtL was worse than patients with &lt;7% MtL (p=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heavy p15INK4b methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is associated with IPSS predictors of poor prognosis and adverse survival </plain></SENT>
