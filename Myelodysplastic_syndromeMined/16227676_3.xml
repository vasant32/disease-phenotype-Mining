<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analyzer stains residual <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51874">auramine</z:chebi> O to provide a reticulocyte maturation differential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the R-3000, we analyzed 119 samples of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) from 111 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters were reticulocytes, immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) percentage in BM and PB, BM/PB reticulocyte ratio, and BM/PB IRF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reticulocytes and IRF percentage in BM were significantly higher than in PB (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a good correlation between reticulocyte percentages in BM and in PB (r = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>) and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> group was classified into three groups: group 1: cases with hematopoietic dysfunction; group 2: cases in bone marrow recovery phase after chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> with bone marrow accelerative phase, and group 3: cases with ineffective hematopoiesis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean reticulocyte percentage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group was 2.3 +/- 1.1%, which was close to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BM/PB reticulocyte ratio of group 3 was statistically higher than that of groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that group 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> and that the BM/PB ratio is a useful indicator for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
