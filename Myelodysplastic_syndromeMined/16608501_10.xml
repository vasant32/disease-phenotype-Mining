<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Liver iron content (LIC) assessment by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is validated but not standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a single center, we tried to assess the accuracy of a specific, simple MRI procedure adapted to high LIC from a well-established simple and routine procedure known to quantify LIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 27 cases of monthly transfused patients, we compared biochemical values of LIC assessed on liver biopsy specimens and results obtained by two signal intensity ratio of gradient echo imaging (R2*) MRI protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first was Gandon's routine procedure previously validated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and the second, our own method, was an addition of a gradient echo sequence specifically adapted to high LIC encountered in hematology practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven liver biopsies were performed in 18 adult patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> = 5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LIC by biopsy ranged from 1.4 to 54 mg/g liver dry weight (mg/g dw) (median 9.4 mg/g dw) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation between LIC by biopsy and by MRI with Gandon's procedure was good (R = 0.80) in patients with LIC falling within the range reported by Gandon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a weak correlation was demonstrated (R = 0.52) in patients with high LIC (above 11.2 mg/g dw) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With our sequences, the correlation was good both in the entire group of patients (R = 0.83) and in patients with LIC above 11.2 mg/g dw (R = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the addition of a specific shorter-gradient echo sequence to a very simple, fast technique produces an accurate estimation of LIC in post-transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
