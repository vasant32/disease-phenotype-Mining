<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A unique <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> referred to as transient <z:mp ids='MP_0001601'>abnormal myelopoiesis</z:mp> (TAM) has been reported to occur primarily in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> (DS) or other abnormalities of chromosome 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disorder raises basic questions regarding the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, yet its natural history is poorly documented and derives from small series and isolated case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To better characterize TAM, we accumulated data on 35 cases identified through a questionnaire mailed to pediatric oncologists in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases, pooled with two that we recently encountered, and 58 comparable cases reported in the literature comprise a series of 95 cases of TAM in DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients in this series were notable for the high morbidity and mortality of this reportedly benign condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of the patients died during the initial event, and the overall mortality for the entire series was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of the 85 patients (33%) who survived the initial event developed a subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e>, most often <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, at a median age of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No initial clinical or hematologic features predicted the development of a subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, those patients initially mosaic for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 did not develop subsequent abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This series reviews questions regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in DS and underscores the importance of conducting future prospective studies of this unique <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
