<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidences exist that microenvironment cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow show functional abnormalities, which may be relevant to the incidence of such a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a very important component of hematopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was supposed to investigate the biological characteristics and functions of MSC derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in low-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSCs from bone marrow samples of 11 low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were isolated, cultured and expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype and osteoblasts differentiation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their capacity of proliferation and hematopoietic supporting in vitro were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method (RQ RT-PCR) was used for detecting the expression levels of relative cytokines and chemokines in MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MSCs from healthy donors were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the culture-expanded cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients displayed a typical fibroblast-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells were positive for SH2 (CD105), SH3 (CD73), Thy-1 (CD90), while negative for CD34 and CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After induction, these cells could differentiate into osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proliferative ability of MSCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were not different from those of MSC isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (p &gt; 0.05), however, their capacity of hematopoietic supporting in vitro were significantly weaker (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RQ RT-PCR detection indicated that the SDF-1 gene expression level in MSCs of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that in MSC derived from healthy donors (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the abnormal function of MSC influences the regulation of hemotopoiesis in the bone marrow microenvironment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is worthy to further investigate the new clue in etiological mechanism and therapeutic strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
