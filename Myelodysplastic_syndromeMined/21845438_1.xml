<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three untreated patients (21 high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 MDS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was administered with the CHG regimen comprised of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (25 mg/day, days 1-14) and homoharringtonine (1 mg/day, days 1-14) by intravenous continuous infusion in combination with G-CSF (300 μg/day) by subcutaneous injection from day 0 until neutrophil count recovery to 2.0 × 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate (OR) was 66.7% after one course of the CHG regimen with 19 patients reaching CR (57.6%) and 3 patients reaching partial remission (PR) (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) appeared longer median OS when compared to patients with high LDH level (18 months vs. 5 months, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 28% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during the induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the CHG priming regimen is effective and safe as a novel induction therapy for elderly patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results need to be conformed in further study involving a larger cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
