<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various morphological dysplastic changes were observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, especially in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify their significance, we divided 45 patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> crisis into two groups by our scoring system, the dysplastic group and the non-dysplastic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of 25 subjects in the non-dysplastic group entered complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of 20 subjects in the dysplastic group did so, and the mean survival after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> crisis is significantly shorter in the dysplastic group than in the non-dysplastic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some patients in the dysplastic group had obvious dysplastic changes several months before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> crises in some cases may occur with or be preceded by the development of dysplastic clones similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; these patients respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
