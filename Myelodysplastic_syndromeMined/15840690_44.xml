<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 129 patients were followed up 45 months after last inclusion in the Nordic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Group studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid response rate was 39% and median response duration 23 months (range, 3-116 months or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete responders showed longer response duration than partial responders (29 versus 12 months, P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) groups Low/Intermediate-1 (Low/Int-1) had longer response duration than Int-2/High (25 versus 7 months, P = .002) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect on long-term outcome by comparing treated patients with untreated patients selected from the IPSS database using multivariate Cox regression, adjusting for major prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in survival (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2; P = .55) or risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> evolution (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7-2.2; P = .40) between treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with high/intermediate probability of response and with IPSS Low/Int-1 show frequent and durable responses without adverse effects on outcome, while other patients should not be considered candidates for this treatment </plain></SENT>
