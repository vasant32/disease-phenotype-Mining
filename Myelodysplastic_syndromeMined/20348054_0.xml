<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A first line of treatment including hematopoietic growth factors (darbepoetin alone or associated with G-CSF) failed after several months and a treatment with lenalidomide was initiated in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment was poorly tolerated (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>) in Patient 1 without an improvement of the quality of life; a progression of the disease was observed with an increase of the bone marrow blastosis and a new acquired karyotypic abnormality (t13;17), leading to the prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had a good response to lenalidomide for several months with an increase in the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level and a transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's prognosis suddenly worsened with the occurrence of a blood blastosis (10%): <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> was thus initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two case reports illustrate the recent advances in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del(5q), including the use of lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
