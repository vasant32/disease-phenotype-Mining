<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a prospective, multi-centre study focused on children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 65; advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> = 44, refractory cytopenia = 21) after allo-SCT in order to determine to what extent relapse can be prevented by pre-emptive immunotherapy on the basis of increasing MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses of chimaerism in 44 patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> revealed 31 cases with complete chimaerism (CC)/low-level MC/transient MC, 11 cases with increasing MC and two cases with decreasing MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same analyses in 21 MDS patients with refractory cytopenia revealed 17 cases with CC/low-level MC, one case with increasing MC and three cases with decreasing MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-emptive immunotherapy performed on each patient that showed increasing MC improved event-free survival from 0%, as seen in prior studies, to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that pre-emptive immunotherapy is an effective treatment option to prevent impending relapse in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
