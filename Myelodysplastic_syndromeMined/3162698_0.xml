<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases were clinicopathologically studied in autopsies from patients who had been administered the contrast medium, Thorotrast, three to five decades previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The short period from the appearance of hematological symptoms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the relatively low percentage of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, the high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e>, i.e., 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients, and a case of atypical megakaryocyte proliferation were revealed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cell infiltration in the spleen tended to become slight or minimal with the progress of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, the degree of spleen swelling was mild or lacking in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients who had been administered Thorotrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, cases such as hyperplastic or normoplastic bone marrow, an increase in immature granulocytic series or no decrease in the number of megakaryocytes were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> of Thorotrast-administered patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was thought that <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the bone marrow as well as in the spleen was induced by Thorotrast deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> of Thorotrast-administered patients, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases were considered to be mainly of the atypical type, and it was speculated that the damage due to Thorotrast may affect the hemopoietic stem cell level and hemopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
