<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified recurrent areas of somatic copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and deletions of chromosome 4q24 in a large cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and related mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN syndromes using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then investigated genes in the commonly affected area for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When we sequenced TET2, we found homozygous and hemizygous mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were found in patients with similar clinical phenotypes without LOH4q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical analysis showed most TET2 mutations were present in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN (58%), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (6/17) or sAML (32%) evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN and typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (10%), suggesting they may play a ubiquitous role in malignant evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TET2 mutations affected conserved domains and the N terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TET2 is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells but its function is unknown, and it lacks homology to other known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mutations in this candidate myeloid regulatory gene suggests an important role in the pathogenesis of poor prognosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN and sAML and may act as a disease gene marker for these often cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> disorders </plain></SENT>
