<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 30) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (n = 30) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 66 years, with 50 patients (83%) being over 60 years of age at time of study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 50% of patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of less than 50 x 10(9)/L in 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 4 to 6 weeks for two courses, then at maximum tolerated dose level (1-2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for five days) once every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (31%) achieved a complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A CR was achieved in 11 of 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (37%) and in eight of 30 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A CR was achieved in 10 of 23 patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight of 11 patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five of which involved chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities) and achieved CR, were evaluated cytogenetically in CR: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characteristics associated with a higher CR rate were lack of previous chemotherapy, absence of ras oncogene mutations, and presence of less than 10% monocytes in either peripheral blood or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CR rates were similar by different agent groups, by different karyotype abnormalities, and by other pre-therapy peripheral blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-myelosuppressive side effects were mucositis in 67% of patients (severe [grade 3-4] 23%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 38% (severe 17%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> in 28% (severe 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Febrile episodes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 85% of patients and documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 47 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality in the first four weeks was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 31 months, the 12 month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In summary, topotecan has significant single-agent activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complete responses associated with topotecan therapy often involve the disappearance of abnormal, poor-prognosis karyotypes, which is particularly encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Future strategies to optimize topotecan's role include combination regimens with topoisomerase II reactive agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
