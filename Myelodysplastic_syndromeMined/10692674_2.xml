<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An IA was defined as being positive for at least one autoimmune laboratory test (e.g. antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients [65 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 3 with RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation] were examined; 47 had IA and 26 had no IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the function of B cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 was measured in cultures of purified B cells with or without stimulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both IL-6 and IL-10 production rates in patients with IA were significantly higher than in patients without IA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The skewing of XCIP of B cells was analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction, and the skewing rate of B cell XCIP was quantitatively assayed by compared to control T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The skewing rate of B cells was higher in patients with IA than in those without IA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a small population of B cells in patients with IA might be derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clones, and be associated with the induction of IA </plain></SENT>
