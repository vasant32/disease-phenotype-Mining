<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> patients were identified, including 19 patients from 3 well-controlled FCR frontline trials (n=426 patients), giving an estimated frequency of 4.5% (1.9-8.3%) in a follow-up period of 44 months (range 5-122 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> could emerge directly from 'prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>' after FCR (10 patients), or after achieving complete hematological recovery (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall latency was 35 months (range 3-118 months), with the former group of 23 months and the latter 42 months (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 cases presented as therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 18 as therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cytogenetics was present in 26 of 27 (96%) patients, with frequent chromosomes 5 and 7 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 7 months after therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the risk of therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> secondary to frontline FCR therapy may not be as high as previously reported after removing the confounding factor of previous cytotoxic exposure, but this risk increased with older age and likely growth factor co-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> after FCR therapy shares clinicopathological features with therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> secondary to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, but has a shorter latency interval indicating possible synergetic effects of the nucleotide analog fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fact that therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> can directly emerge from 'prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>' warrants a bone marrow examination to rule out therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in this clinical setting </plain></SENT>
