<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absence of enzyme activity is due to homozygous inherited deletion of the gene, reducing detoxification of carcinogens such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32955">epoxides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and potentially increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that GST null genotype would increase risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from bone marrow slides of 292 AML/MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification was used to assign GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes for cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given that the frequency of the null genotype varies by ethnicity and that the majority of the cases were Caucasian, analyses were restricted to 232 white (non-Hispanic) cases and 153 Caucasian non <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GSTM1 null was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases compared with controls [64 versus 47%; odds ratio (OR), 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-3.1]; P = 0.001], whereas the frequency of GSTT1 null genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases was not statistically different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> comprises biologically distinct subtypes, and a test for homogeneity revealed a statistically significant difference among subtypes (P = 0.04; df, 8) for GSTM1 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, there was an increased frequency of GSTM1 null genotypes in French-American-British groups M3 [82%; n = 22; OR, 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6-21.3)] and M4 [72%; n = 53; OR, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the GSTM1 null genotype is a significant risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e>, particularly French-American-British groups M3 and M4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may indicate an important role for exogenous carcinogens in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
