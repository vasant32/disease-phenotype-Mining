<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is not a strict demarcation of them, so that mixed syndromes can develop as are hypoplastic syndromes on one side and mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MPS) on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among our 616 pts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> we looked for those cases, who had beside <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> signs of myeloproliferation with increased number of blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were examined in detail including bone-marrow histology, bone marrow cultivation, cytogenetics and bcr-abl gen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MPS were found in 22 patients at the first contact with the patient (13 patients had thrombocytemia and 9 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further 7 patients were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, proliferative syndrome developed after several months (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MPS in evolution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of thrombocytemia was relatively stable, the number of leukocytes was progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had variable degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ring-sideroblasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> were frequent finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men prevailed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and cultivation findings were similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, deletion of long arm of chromosome 20 was present in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and myeloproliferation were found in 4% of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, designated as mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MPS) </plain></SENT>
