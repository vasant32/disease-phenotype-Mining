<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients exposed to DNA inter-strand crosslinking (ICL) agents subsequently experience an elevated incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) patients are deficient in the repair of crosslink DNA damage and they experience a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that hematopoietic cells are specific target for the transforming effects of DNA crosslinking damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in transcript levels were characterized in human hematopoietic cells occurring in response to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>), but not in response to monofunctional analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only modest changes in a few gene transcripts were detected in HL60 cells exposed to levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> tittered to maximal dose that caused growth suppression with minimal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and allowed eventual resumption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of transient growth suppression, a subset of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST) isoenzyme genes was consistently upregulated three to fourfold by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>, but not by monofunctional analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent efforts to confirm the changes detected by microarray analyses revealed an unexpected dependence on treatment conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GST alpha class A2 subfamily member transcripts were upregulated 24 h after a 1 h exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> that caused an extensive, but transient block in late S/G2 cell cycle phase, but were minimally altered with continuous exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-h exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> caused a transient late S/G2 cell cycle arrest in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cell line and the Colo 320HSR human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of GSTA2 by transient transfection protected Colo 320HSR cells against both cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of GSTA2 in Colo 320HSR cells induced after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> did not alter cycle arrest or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that human GSTA2 facilitates the protection of cells from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi> damage and not repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the possibility that GSTA2 polymorphisms, variable isoenzyme expression, and variable induced expression may be factors in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
