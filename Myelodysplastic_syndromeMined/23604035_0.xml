<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that, while overexpressed in low risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the Fas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor becomes undetectable on CD34+ progenitors when the disease progresses to secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (sAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at investigating the interplay between NFκB and Fas during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first observed that Fas was inducible by TNFα in the HL60 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cells, p65/RelA bound to the chromatin at FAS promoter, while inhibition of NFκB pathway by IKKα inhibitor BAY11-7082 or lentiviral expression of a non-degradable mutant of IκBα, IκSR blocked the expression of Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, TNFα failed to induce Fas expression in the colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line SW480, due to hypermethylation of the FAS promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> rescued p65/RelA binding on FAS promoter and, subsequently Fas expression in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also show that, inhibition of NFκB pathway decreased the expression of Fas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD45loCD34+ bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, despite of the nuclear expression of p65/RelA, Fas was often low on CD45loCD34+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNFα failed to stimulate its expression, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> efficiently rescued p65/RelA binding and Fas re-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that DNA methylation at NFκB sites is responsible for FAS gene silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rescuing FAS gene expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> could contribute to slacken the progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
