<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these children have inherited the neurocutaneous disease from an affected mother; boys are more often affected than girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the rare finding of a 7-year-old girl with NF-1 who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She inherited her NF-1 from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of her initial presentation, clonogenic assays of bone marrow mononuclear cells did not show the spontaneous growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units or hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor that is characteristic of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 month, repeat evaluations of the patient's clinical and laboratory test results became fully consistent with those for a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This illustrates the stepwise evolution of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> in NF-1 and the importance of close follow-up and reassessment of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case is only the second report of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> in a girl who inherited NF-1 from her father </plain></SENT>
