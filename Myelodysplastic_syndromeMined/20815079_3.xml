<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to evaluate completeness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> registration in the Seattle-Puget Sound region of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program-which has reported the highest rates among the SEER registries since mandatory reporting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> began in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases of any age that occurred within a nonprofit healthcare system in western Washington State in 2005 or 2006 through the local SEER registry or by relevant diagnostic code followed by medical chart review to classify these patients as unlikely, possible, or definite/probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated age-standardized incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and for case groups based on identification method, and we summarized medical histories of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence in our study population was estimated as 7.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2005-2006 when combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases identified by SEER and definite/probable cases identified by chart review, which was similar to the rate of 6.9 reported by our local SEER registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases identified from chart review increased the rate to 10.2 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients frequently had previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnoses (25%) and comorbidities such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our investigation suggests that although reporting of confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnoses in our region appears complete, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> incidence is likely underestimated because of omission of cases who are symptomatic but do not receive definitive diagnoses </plain></SENT>
