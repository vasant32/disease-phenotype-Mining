<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The highest doses administered were 80 (n = 1), 160 (n = 4), 320 (n = 8) and 640 U/kg (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) showed an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, white blood cells and platelets with 80 U/kg rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> while on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation) also transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other 11 patients no response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between in vitro culture data and in vivo responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated and no nonhematological side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From this study we conclude that rhEpo, even when given at high doses, has a low response rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed in order to clarify whether rhEpo increases the potential risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
