<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To define the role of quantitative graft composition and donor killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype in clinical outcome following unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings, 43 consecutive transplants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients underwent myeloablative conditioning and 19 received busulphan/fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>; n = 18), no relapse occurred following transplants meeting both a high (above median) natural killer (NK) cell count and missing HLA-ligand(s) to donor's KIR(s), compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients (0% versus 44%; P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Missing HLA-B and/or HLA-C ligand combined with missing HLA-A3/11 (KIR3DL2 unblocked) predicted for reduced relapse incidence regardless of diagnosis or conditioning type (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients, this constellation predicted superior overall survival (OS) (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transplants with more than two different activating donor KIRs were associated with an increased risk for non-relapse mortality (NRM), both by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative graft composition had a significant impact exclusively in RIC transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, a trend towards reduced relapse incidence was found in patients receiving high numbers of NK cells (16% versus 54%; P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving high versus low T cell numbers, OS was superior (83% versus 37%; P = 0.01), due mainly to reduced NRM (0% versus 33%; P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, relapse risk was decreased significantly in patients receiving high NK cell numbers (P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that both the number of transplanted NK cells and the donor KIR genotype play a role in graft-versus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> mechanisms in HLA-identical PBSCT </plain></SENT>
