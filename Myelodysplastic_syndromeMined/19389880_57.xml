<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vaccination consisted of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor subcutaneously days 1 to 4, and WT1.126-134 peptide and 1 mg keyhole limpet hemocyanin on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial 9 patients received 4 vaccinations biweekly, then monthly, and the subsequent 10 patients received continual biweekly vaccination </plain></SENT>
