<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation is commonly used to investigate patients with possible dense granule <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032197" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage pool deficiency</z:e> (delta SPD), but recent studies have shown that this investigation is not specific or sensitive for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple one-step technique to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> loaded platelets by flow cytometry and found a good correlation (r = 0.83) between this method and the enumeration of platelet dense granules by conventional fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with congenital delta SPD had significantly (P &lt; 0.001) reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> labelling detected by flow cytometry (mean 15%; range 5-23%) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean 48%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 32-64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398627" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary platelet disorders</z:e> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> labelling (mean 49%; range 34-66%) and were clearly distinguished from patients with delta SPD despite similar platelet aggregation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acquired delta SPD is frequently associated with the platelet function defect described in the myeloproliferative and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e>) and we compared platelet aggregation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> labelling in 15 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that delta SPD occurs commonly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e> with 7/15 patients having reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> staining but, like the findings in hereditary delta SPD, 3/7 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet aggregation had delta SPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003540'>abnormal platelet aggregation</z:hpo> was not diagnostic of delta SPD as 4/8 of these patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results may contribute to the known lack of correlation between the limited assessment of platelet function and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> labelling of platelets detected by flow cytometry to be a useful, simple and inexpensive method to detect hereditary and acquired delta SPD which will improve the definition of the platelet defect in these disorders in the clinical laboratory </plain></SENT>
