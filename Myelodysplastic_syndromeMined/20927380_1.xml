<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The hypomethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-Azacytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-CR) is the first drug to prolong overall survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23636">deoxyribonucleoside</z:chebi> analog <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-CdR) did not have a similar effect on survival in a large clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both drugs are thought to exert their effects after incorporation into DNA by covalent binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While 5-Aza-CdR is incorporated into only DNA, 5-Aza-CR is also incorporated into <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have analyzed whether this difference in nucleic acid incorporation may influence the capacities of these drugs to regulate the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and microRNAs (miRNA), which may potentially affect the activities of the drugs in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A hematopoietic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>) and a solid (T24; transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line were treated with equitoxic doses of 5-Aza-CR and 5-Aza-CdR for 24 hrs, and the immediate (day 2) and lasting (day 8) effects on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was considerable overlap between the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> heritably upregulated by both drugs on day 8 but more <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were stably induced by the deoxy analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both drugs strongly induced expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> testis antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 2 more <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were downregulated by 5-Aza-CR, particularly at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A remarkable downregulation of miRNAs and a significant upregulation of tRNA synthetases and other genes involved in amino acid metabolism was observed in T24 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this suggests that significant differences exist in the immediate action of the two drugs, however the dominant pattern of the lasting, and possible heritable changes, is overlapping </plain></SENT>
