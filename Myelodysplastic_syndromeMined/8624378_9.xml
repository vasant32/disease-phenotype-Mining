<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, 17 patients (eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and ring sideroblasts, and seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and excess of blast cells) were treated with a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> for durations of 8-16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absolute neutrophil counts increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet counts increased</z:e> in five patients with discontinuation of transfusion needs in two of four transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of erythropoiesis was seen in eight patients with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in three, a discontinuation of transfusion requirements in another three, and a significant increase in reticulocyte counts as the only parameter in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically important multilineage responses with increases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels or discontinuation of transfusion needs were thus seen in six patients (35.3%) with three patients having a trilineage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum erythropoietin concentrations did not differ significantly between responders and nonresponders, but the erythroid response was accompanied by a rise in the serum transferrin receptor levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio and the maturation index of myeloid cells increased during therapy, while the percentage of blast cells did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated the persistence of the abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to therapy, nonresponders had a significantly higher serum TNF level than responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and soluble TNF-alpha receptor significantly increased during therapy, but mainly in the patients without an erythroid and platelet response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Soluble IL-2 receptor and soluble ICAM-1 concentrations both increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This pilot study demonstrates that treatment with ATRA/G-CSF/EPO/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> is well tolerated, leading to normalization of neutrophil counts in most, and to improvement of platelets and red blood cells in a significant subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
