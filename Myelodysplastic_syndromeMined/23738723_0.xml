<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Rigosertib (ON 01910.Na, Estybon) is a novel, anticancer agent undergoing phase 3 clinical trials for a lead indication against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this research, the permeability of rigosertib was evaluated using the in-situ perfused rat intestine (IPRI) model to support development of an oral formulation for rigosertib for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiments (n = 6 per group) were conducted using male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies evaluated permeability across various intestinal segments and assessed the dose-linearity of absorption over the entire intestinal length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug concentrations in the portal and jugular vein were collected to correlate permeability parameters with presystemic and systemic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Rigosertib permeability was highest in the jejunum, although parameter estimates indicated that rigosertib was a medium permeability compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The compound displayed nonlinear absorption in the IPRI model, suggesting a saturable transport process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transport inhibition studies using Caco-2 cells demonstrated that rigosertib was a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absolute bioavailability of rigosertib (10 and 20 mg/kg, 1-h infusion) in rats was estimated to be 10-15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the fraction absorbed in humans predicted from IPRI data (52%) was consistent with published clinical data for rigosertib (35% oral bioavailability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this research indicated that rigosertib is a promising candidate for oral delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential impact of P-gp and other intestinal transporters on the oral absorption of this promising anticancer agent </plain></SENT>
