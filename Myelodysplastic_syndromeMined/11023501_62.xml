<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From November 1994 to February 1999, 30 UCB transplant procedures were performed for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases in 27 children, aged 0.4 to 17.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received either HLA-matched (n = 3) or 1- or 2-antigen-mismatched (n = 27) UCB following 1 of 2 standardized preparative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> regimens (hyperfractionated total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin [ATG] with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>; or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, melphalan, and ATG with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 27 days (12-60 days) and 75 days (33-158 days) posttransplantation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was noted between neutrophil and platelet engraftment and nucleated cells per kilogram, CD34(+) cells per kilogram infused, or cytomegalovirus status of recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade 2 or greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was 37.2%, and of grade 3 or greater GVHD was 8.8% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD4, CD19, and natural killer cell recovery was achieved at a median of 12, 6, and 2 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD8 recovery was delayed at a median of 9 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival, disease-free survival, and event-free survival at 1 year was 52.3% (34.1%-70.5%), 54.7% (34.5%-74.9 %) and 49.6% (29.9%-69.4%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This series of 30 UCB transplants suggests that although CD8 cell recovery is delayed, the pattern of immune reconstitution with UCB is similar to that reported for other stem cell sources </plain></SENT>
