<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite multiple disparate prognostic risk analysis systems for evaluating clinical outcome for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), imprecision persists with such analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To attempt to improve on these systems, an International <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Risk Analysis Workshop combined cytogenetic, morphological, and clinical data from seven large previously reported risk-based studies that had generated prognostic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A global analysis was performed on these patients, and critical prognostic variables were re-evaluated to generate a consensus prognostic system, particularly using a more refined bone marrow (BM) cytogenetic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis indicated that the major variables having an impact on disease outcome for evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> were cytogenetic abnormalities, percentage of BM myeloblasts, and number of cytopenias; for survival, in addition to the above, variables also included age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic subgroups of outcome were as follows: "good" outcomes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, -Y alone, del(5q) alone, del(20q) alone; "poor" outcomes were complex (ie, &gt; or = 3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 anomalies; and "intermediate" outcomes were other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis combined these cytogenetic subgroups with percentage of BM blasts and number of cytopenias to generate a prognostic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weighting these variables by their statistical power separated patients into distinctive subgroups of risk for 25% of patients to undergo evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, with: low (31% of patients), 9.4 years; intermediate-1 (INT-1; 39%), 3.3 years; INT-2 (22%), 1.1 years; and high (8%), 0.2 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These features also separated patients into similar distinctive risk groups for median survival: low, 5.7 years; INT-1, 3.5 years; INT-2, 1.2 years; and high, 0.4 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratification for age further improved analysis of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with prior risk-based classifications, this International Prognostic Scoring System provides an improved method for evaluating prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This classification system should prove useful for more precise design and analysis of therapeutic trials in this disease </plain></SENT>
