<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cases were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, and chromosome aberrations were recorded according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure to suspected leukemogenic agents was assessed blindly by an industrial hygienist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased risks were noted for mechanics, welders, electricians, and drivers among men and among farmers and textile workers among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased SMRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in a census-based cohort study conducted in the same area (Torino) were previously reported for electricians and drivers among men and for textile workers among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected nonstatistically significant increased relative risks for exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (odds ratio, OR = 1.7), petrol refining products (1.9), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33848">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (1.7), and electromagnetic fields (1.6) in men; in women, a statistically significant association with exposure to pesticides was detected [OR = 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-11.5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although exposure to pesticides was confined to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases included a high proportion of subjects exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and electromagnetic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No particular histologic subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was associated with chemical exposures except for that of pesticides with the M4 category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome aberrations were not associated with chemical exposures (OR = 1.0), but a nonstatistically significant excess was noted in association with electromagnetic fields (OR = 2.1) </plain></SENT>
