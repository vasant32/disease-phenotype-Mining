<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>LIGHT is a recently cloned novel cytokine belonging to the TNF family that is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells (iDCs) generated from monocytes isolated from human PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these studies, we demonstrate that exogenous soluble LIGHT or soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L) can promote monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation in vitro by the up-regulation of CD86, CD80, CD83, and HLA-DR antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immature dendritic cells differentiated from monocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients displayed lower levels of costimulatory and HLA-DR molecules compared with iDCs differentiated from monocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, upon induction of maturation by LIGHT or CD40L, the expression of costimulatory and HLA-DR molecules is comparable between DCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exogenous LIGHT- and CD40L-stimulated mature DCs (mDCs) also displayed increased antigen presentation to autologous T lymphocytes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxin) or allogeneic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DCs matured by LIGHT showed increased secretion of IL-6, IL-12p75, and TNF-alpha, but not IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both LIGHT and CD40L are immunoregulating factors that induce monocyte-derived iDCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to undergo maturation resulting in increased antigen presentation and T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monocyte-derived DCs can be stimulated to undergo phenotypic and functional changes with LIGHT that might be applied in the development of a DC-based vaccine for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
