<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up data have not yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe 6 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low- or intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who began lenalidomide therapy between April 2002 and June 2003 as part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-001 study and who have maintained long-term therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients had an ongoing requirement for red blood cell transfusions despite previous treatment with recombinant erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient began lenalidomide therapy because of progressive and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients maintained long-term transfusion independence (over 4.5 years) while receiving oral lenalidomide therapy, including 5 patients who remain on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained erythroid response was reported despite persistence of the deletion 5q [del(5q)] abnormality in 3 of the 4 patients with del(5q) at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Side effects were largely predictable and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The favorable outcomes presented here show that lenalidomide can induce durable erythroid responses with sustained transfusion independence that can exceed 6 years in patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
