<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years much progress has been made in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and there are now several therapeutic compounds used with varying levels of success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds typically cause side effects that make them unattractive for treatment of patients in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Naturally occurring compounds that are not toxic may provide a means to treat patients in the initial stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pilot study to test the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q10 (coQ10) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low to intermediate-2 risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A variety of responses were observed in 7 of 29 patients including two trilineage and two cytogenetic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) from pretreatment bone marrows showed multiple mutations, some resulting in amino acid changes, in 3/5 nonresponders, 1/4 responders and in two control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that coQ10 may be of clinical benefit in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but responders cannot be easily pre-selected on the basis of either the conventional clinical and pathologic characteristics or mtDNA mutations </plain></SENT>
