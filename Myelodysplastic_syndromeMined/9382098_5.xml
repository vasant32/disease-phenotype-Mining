<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The identification of genes responsible for the rare cases of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may afford insight into the mechanism underlying the more common <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we test a single family with 11 relevant meioses transmitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> for linkage to three potential candidate loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a different family with inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, linkage to chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 was recently reported; we exclude linkage to 21q22.1-22.2, demonstrating that familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After reviewing familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and observing anticipation in the form of a declining <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> with each generation, we had proposed 9p21-22 and 16q22 as additional candidate loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas linkage to 9p21-22 can be excluded, the finding of a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.82 with the microsatellite marker D16S522 at a recombination fraction theta = 0 provides evidence supporting linkage to 16q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis reveals a 23.5-cM (17.9-Mb) commonly inherited region among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members extending from D16S451 to D16S289 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to extract maximum linkage information with missing individuals, incomplete informativeness with individual markers in this interval, and possible deviance from strict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, we performed nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL) and found a maximum NPL statistic corresponding to a P-value of .00098, close to the maximum conditional probability of linkage expected for a pedigree with this structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis in this region specifically excludes expansion of the AT-rich minisatellite repeat FRA16B fragile site and the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the E2F-4 transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The "repeat expansion detection" method, capable of detecting dynamic mutation associated with anticipation, more generally excludes large CAG repeat expansion as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in this family </plain></SENT>
