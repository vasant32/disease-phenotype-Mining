<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (&lt;20% blasts) and evaluable cytogenetic studies (1966-present) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome of patients with deletion 5q or with loss of chromosome 5 (<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5) was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2743 patients analyzed, 287 (10%) had deletion 5q and 216 (8%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 9 months with deletion 5q, 6 months with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5, and 17 months without a chromosome 5 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering patients with deletion 5q, the median survival was 33 months with deletion 5q alone, 17 months with deletion 5q and 1 additional abnormality, but only 6 months to 12 months with deletion 5q and &gt; or =2 abnormalities or chromosome 7 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 93 patients (3.4% of total) had lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (international prognostic scoring system low or intermediate 1) and deletion 5q; their median survival was 29 months (2-year survival 60%), and ranged from 13-41 months depending on the presence or absence of additional chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 198 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with deletion 5q and &lt;10% blasts (a subset now often offered lenalidomide), the median survival was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 5 was significantly more frequently associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and with other chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provided baseline expectations of outcome in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subsets and deletion 5q </plain></SENT>
