<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Huge <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was the major gross abnormality; mice were rather anemic, and neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002890" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leukoerythroblastosis</z:e> nor invasion into tissues such as liver, kidneys or lymph nodes was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter phases of the disease, the proliferating cell type tended to shift to a variety of single-lineage hematopoiesis, but the majority of mice still showed the presence of multilineage hematopoiesis; such cells were somewhat dysplastic but low in neoplastic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A long-term observation by transplantation of the hematopoietic cells into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice resulted in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growths</z:e> in the recipients; not only was myelodysplastic hypercellularity seen, but also single-lineage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> such as B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, histiocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and even myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease bore the proliferative feature solely in the spleen and bone marrow, and the transition from multilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> into single-lineage hematopoiesis at some frequency is reminiscent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results that the SV40 large T antigen was expressed in every proliferating cell, and that there was no apparent increase in any colony-stimulating cytokine(s), together with the results of the transplantation assays, suggested that the hyperproliferation of the hematopoietic cells was a direct consequence of the expression of SV40 large T antigen in these cells themselves </plain></SENT>
