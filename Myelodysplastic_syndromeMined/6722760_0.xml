<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed in 56 cases (88.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities were hypodiploidy and structural defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes most often involved were #7, #5, and #17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was seen more often following malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 seemed more common in patients formerly exposed to professional hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic "variation" is often accompanied by cytologic "variation," which could explain the high proportion of ANLL cases that are difficult to classify into the FAB system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between complete <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and the presence of micromegakaryocytes and/or macroplatelets  </plain></SENT>
