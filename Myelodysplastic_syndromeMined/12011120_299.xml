<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Supportive care is standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (Aza C) was active in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 191 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to compare Aza C (75 mg/m(2)/d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days) with supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was defined by French-American-British criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New rigorous response criteria were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both arms received transfusions and antibiotics as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the supportive care arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross over to Aza C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving supportive care (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to leukemic transformation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 21 months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P =.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in 38% receiving supportive care (P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to Aza C, a landmark analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an additional 18 months for Aza C and 11 months for supportive care (P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quality-of-life assessment found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients initially randomized to Aza C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aza C treatment results in significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared with supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aza C provides a new treatment option that is superior to supportive care for patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes and specific entry criteria treated in this study </plain></SENT>
