<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This complication is now being associated with an expanding list of chemotherapeutic agents including topoisomerase II poisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi> is an agent with potential to cause t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and which is being used increasingly in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> as part of adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> between 1986 and 1992 were studied to determine the incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 72 months, 2 cases of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 1 of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This 5% incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is high and likely related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas this agent is effective and has acceptable toxicity in advanced disease, its incorporation into adjuvant treatment regimens cannot be recommended based on this experience </plain></SENT>
