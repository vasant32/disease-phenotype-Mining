<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study included 21 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, 15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and one each with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and juvenile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in third or subsequent remission, relapse or partial remission with refractory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at the time of CBT were considered to be in advanced phase, and placed in the high-risk (HR) group (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> and the second CR after a relapse (n = 8), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> after a rejection (n = 3), following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the first CR were included in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates for neutrophil and platelet recovery were 83.7 +/- 12.2 at d 60 and 55.4 +/- 16.6% at d 100 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grades II-VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 58.5 +/- 16.8% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing EFS was disease status at CBT: SR patients had a 3-year EFS of 75.0 +/- 21.6%, compared with 29.6 +/- 20.6% for those with HR disease (P = 0.013, RR 4.746, 95% CI 1.382-16.298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that HLA-mismatched, unrelated CBT is a feasible procedure to cure a significant proportion of children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, especially if conducted in a favourable phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
