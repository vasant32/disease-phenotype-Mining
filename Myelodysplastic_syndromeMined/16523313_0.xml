<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD43 is a sialylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expressed on the surface of most haemopoietic cells and has been implicated in cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that CD43 expression is altered in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This raised the question of whether the alteration is associated with transfusions in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of this antigen on peripheral blood leucocytes in two groups of patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 22 transfused and 20 non-transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found decreased expression of CD43 on the monocytes and neutrophils of patients receiving transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other activation molecules were studied (CD11b, CD18) and were found up-regulated suggesting the existence of activated leucocytes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased levels of soluble vascular cellular endothelial molecule after transfusions in these patients suggested vascular endothelial activation in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given together, these results show that decreased CD43 in the transfused group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is associated with an activated endothelial phenotype </plain></SENT>
