<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>--nine with cytogenetically identified 12p abnormalities and 23 with whole or partial losses of chromosome 12--were selected for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) investigations of 12p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These analyses revealed structural 12p changes, such as translocations, deletions, insertions, inversions and amplification, in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ETV6 rearrangements were detected in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had t(4;12)(q12;p13) as the sole anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), displayed complex abnormalities involving, among others, chromosomes 9 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third case, also an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, had an insertion of the distal part of ETV6 into chromosome arm 11q and into multiple ring chromosomes, which also contained chromosome 11 material, resulting in an amplification of a possible fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fusion partners in these cases remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one additional breakpoints on 12p could be characterized in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of these breaks were shown to result in interchromosomal rearrangements, possibly indicating the location of hitherto unrecognized genes of importance in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FISH analyses disclosed terminal or interstitial 12p deletions in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> showed deletions restricted to a region, including ETV6 and CDKN1B, which has been reported to be frequently lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four cases, the deletions involved both these genes, whereas two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> displayed loss of CDKN1B but not ETV6, supporting previously reported findings indicating a region of deletion not including this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> lacked one copy of ETV6 but not CDKN1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, we suggest a minimal region of deletion on 12p located between the ETV6 and CDKN1B genes </plain></SENT>
