<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin (TPO) has been successfully used to stimulate megakaryocyte progenitor proliferation and platelet production both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and other investigators have found that TPO also stimulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to its effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow precursors, TPO stimulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) progenitor proliferation in only 25% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the hematopoietic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) originate from both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic clones, we hypothesized that TPO may be a useful therapeutic agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used fresh marrow samples taken from 14 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) and erythropoietin (EPO) TPO (5 to 40 ng/ml) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CFU-GM and BFU-E colony-forming cell proliferation were stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion by up to 103% and 93% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was similar to the stimulation obtained with optimal concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TPO increased the colony-stimulatory effects of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of either T lymphocytes or adherent cells abrogated the effect of TPO, suggesting that the effect is not a direct one but is mediated through interaction with cytokines produced by accessory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that the therapeutic role of TPO in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
