<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine kinases such as SRC family kinases (SFKs) as well as the mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) serine/threonine kinase are often constitutively activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and hence constitute potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi>, which has previously been shown to mediate antiproliferative/cytotoxic off-target effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts, reduces SFK overactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">Erlotinib</z:chebi> induced an arrest in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle that, in cells with constitutive SFK activation, could be recapitulated by chemical inhibition of SFKs with 3-(4-chlorophenyl)1-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">1,1-dimethylethyl</z:chebi>)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-Î±]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38616">pyrimidin-4-amine</z:chebi> (PP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR targets like p70 (SK6) , stimulated the maturation of the autophagic marker LC3 and promoted the formation of autophagosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, PP2 and the mTOR inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> had a similar cell cycle-arresting activity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi>, but neither of these compounds alone induced significant levels of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results suggest that the therapeutic off-target effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> may be linked to, yet cannot be entirely explained by, the inhibition of oncogenic signaling via SFKs and mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, combination therapies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> might be beneficial for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
