<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the effects of additional therapy with (177)Lu-octreotate in patients in whom progressive disease developed after an initial benefit from regular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with progressive disease after an initial radiologic or clinical response were treated with additional cycles of (177)Lu-octreotate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intended cumulative dose of additional therapy was 14.8 GBq in 2 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were evaluated using Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group criteria, including minor response (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size reduction of &gt;or=25% and &lt;50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) after regular therapy was 27 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, the intended cumulative dose was not achieved (2 had progressive disease, 2 had long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity grade 3 was observed in 4 patients, and grade 4, in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 16 mo (range, 1-40 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Renewed <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> was observed in 8 patients (2 partial remission, 6 minor response), and 8 patients had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 17 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcome was less favorable in patients with a short <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> after regular cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment effects in patients with pancreatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> were similar to those in patients with other gastroenteropancreatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients tolerated additional cycles with (177)Lu-octreotate well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None developed serious delayed adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additional cycles with (177)Lu-octreotate can have antitumor effects, but effects were less than for the regular cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This may be because of a worse clinical condition, more extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, or changed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this salvage therapy can be effective and is safe </plain></SENT>
