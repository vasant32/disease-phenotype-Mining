<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed TET2 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in a cohort of patients with myeloid disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, aiming to determine the usefulness of the technique in the identification of TET2 gene alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A TET2 deletion was found in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suggesting that fluorescence in situ hybridization may have a role in identification of TET2 deletions, at least in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
