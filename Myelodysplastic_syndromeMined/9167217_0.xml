<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol level as well as serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase (GGT) were measured in 65 samples of bone marrow blood and in matched peripheral blood taken from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As expected, serum LDH activities were higher and serum total cholesterol levels were lower in the bone marrow blood than in the blood taken from the cubital vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, an important increase of heat-labile ALP, but not of serum GGT, was found in the bone marrow blood obtained from patients characterized by a proliferating bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actually, both LDH and ALP activities were obviously higher in the bone marrow blood of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than in samples taken from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, a disease characterized by a slower proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the expected increased LDH activity is the result of an accelerated turnover of bone marrow cells implying the release of this enzyme from the dividing and/or decaying cells, the much higher activity of the heat-labile alkaline phosphatase found in the bone marrow blood would reflect an enhanced local remodeling of bone structures, probably related to an expanded proliferating bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower serum cholesterol level in the bone marrow blood could be subsequent to an enhanced uptake of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> by specific receptors on the bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
