<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The active metabolite of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] is a major physiologic regulator of mineral metabolism in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The compound is also a potent inducer of differentiation of a human promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction of differentiation of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to functional end cells offers an appealing therapeutic prospect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 both to induce in vitro the differentiation of blast cells taken from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and to improve hematopoiesis in vivo in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that high concentrations (10-6 M) of 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly induced the in vitro differentiation of blast cells as measured by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, phagocytosis, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A concentration of 10-9 M 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on blast cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We gave 2 microgram/day of 1,25(OH)2D3 to 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>) in an attempt to improve their hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During therapy, their peak peripheral blood granulocyte, platelet, and macrophage concentrations were slightly elevated as compared to their baseline, starting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a partial or minor peripheral blood response to the compound during the administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no patient showed significant improvement of peripheral blood cell or marrow blast cell counts by the end of the study (greater than or equal to 12 weeks) as compared to their starting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> before or by 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 18 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the study shows that high concentrations (10-6M) of 1,25(OH)2D3 can induce differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blast cells in vitro, but the administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 to patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>) does not have an enduring therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>Hypercalcemia</z:hpo> prevented administering greater amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the future, the use of new <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> analogs that induce hematopoietic cell differentiation without inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> might allow the achievement of higher blood levels of the inducing compound and might be medically useful for selected preleukemic and leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
