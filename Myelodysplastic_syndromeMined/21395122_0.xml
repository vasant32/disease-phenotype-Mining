<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of one of the three investigated mutations was identified: 4 in gene NPM1 (9.1%) and 2--FLT3-ITD (4.5%); simultaneous FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation--1 (2.3%); no progression in NPM1 within 9-20 months--3, although with chromosome 7 damage--2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that NPM1 mutation without complex karyotype may serve as marker of relatively favorable course </plain></SENT>
