<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an increased incidence of GSTT1 null genotype was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by comparison with a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed GSTT1 gene by PCR in 174 MDS cases and 100 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GSTT1 null genotype was 22% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 19% in controls (P = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GSTT1 null genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> did not differ according to gender, FAB classification, karyotype and whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were therapy related or 'de novo' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 86 of the de novo cases, data on previous occupational and environmental exposure to a list of 170 substances were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, a significantly lower frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was seen in cases with previous jobs exposed to chemicals, and with previous exposure to mineral dusts and exhaust gases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A lower frequency (but with only borderline significance) was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who had been coal miners and those who had been exposed to any of the 70 substances analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, GSTT1 null genotype occurred at a similar incidence (19%) in controls and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases previously exposed to any substance, but tended to be higher in unexposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (40%, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results do not confirm the higher incidence of GSTT1 null genotype observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lower incidence of GSTT1 null genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases exposed to some compounds previously found associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is apparently unexpected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it could be explained by the fact that GSTT1 enzyme, which has a detoxification role for some compounds, could also have an activating role for other substances, including solvents </plain></SENT>
