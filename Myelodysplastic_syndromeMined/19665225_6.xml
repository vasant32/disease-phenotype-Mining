<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the degree of consistency of scoring karyotypes, the International Working Group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Cytogenetics (IWGMC) conducted a survey of 32 abnormal karyotype challenges carried out in two phases: (a) an initial survey without any specified karyotype counting guidelines and (b) a second survey conducted after the development of IWGMC consensus guidelines for scoring karyotype complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that IWGMC guidelines were simple and clear for the cytogeneticists in scoring karyotype complexity, but not as clear for the hematologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose an immediate need for standardized international karyotype counting practices and a corresponding IPSS cytogenetic risk that can be incorporated into the cytogenetics reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
