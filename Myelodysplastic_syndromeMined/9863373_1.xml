<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) is one of the essential enzymes in the terminal stages of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle in the liver which participates in the elimination of ammonia from the human body [1, 7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Except in liver tissue arginase is also present in many human tissues and in the circulating blood cells, especially in erythrocytes and leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arginase splits arginase to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> that serve for biosynthesis of amino acid proline, glutamic acid and biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arginase activity is high during the mitotic cycle, with the function in phase S of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the arginase activity in the blood of children with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the arginase activity in blood plasma and erythrocytes of children who suffer from some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> (27 patients) and in healthy children (control group-15 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enzyme activity was measured with spectrophotometric method on the basis of the determination of the amount of liberated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> from substrate-arginine [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The obtained results suggest that arginase activity was much higher in the blood of ill children (Table 1 and Figure 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group of children (total 15) plasma arginase activity was in the range of 0 to 20 U/L x = 0.86 U/L), and enzyme activity in erythrocytes was 1.62-3.98 U/g Hb (x = 2.81 U/g Hb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erythrocytes enzyme activity and plasma enzyme activity were in ranges of 4.03-5.26 U/L with the mean value of x = 4.56 U/L, and arginase activity in erythrocytes was in ranges of 9.38-14.16 U/g Hb, with mean value x = 11.34 U/g Hb, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arginase activity in erythrocytes was also significantly higher in children with non-spherocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> (9 children) and was in ranges of 5.33-9.58 U/g Hb (x = 7.29 U/g Hb), with the relatively low values in plasma, 0-4.14 U/L (x = 1.75 U/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In children with sideropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (total number-11) arginase activity in erythrocytes was also very significantly increased with the range between 2.86 and 14.16 U/g Hb (x = 5.54 U/g Hb) while the plasma enzyme activity was relatively low, with the values in range of 0-4.98 U/L (x = 1.41 U/L); in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (4 pts) arginase activity in plasma was very low (0-0.71 U/L; x = 0.26 U/L) with higher values of arginase activity in erythrocytes (4.22-5.89 U/g Hb; x = 4.94 U/g Hb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We have concluded that the enzyme activity was the highest in erythrocyte haemolysates of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo>, non-sherocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo>; it was also high, but in a smaller degree, in erythrocytes of children with sideropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; arginase activity in plasma of these children was higher in comparison with enzyme activity in plasma and erythrocytes of healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results are in agreement with data from literature where it is stated that the younger erythrocytes have the highest arginase activity than the mature erythrocytes [4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The measurement of arginase activity in plasma and erythrocytes is a good diagnostic indicator for the presence of young erythrocytes and reticulocytes in the circulating blood as is the good sign for the detection of haemolytic processes </plain></SENT>
