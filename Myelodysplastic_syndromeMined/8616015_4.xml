<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of an ex vivo expansion culture system using multiple cytokine combinations was evaluated in 38 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with the aim of overcoming the defective in vitro growth of haemopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of four growth factors (GF) including SCF, IL-3, IL-6 and GM-CSF was identified as the optimal combination for expanding clonogenic progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow liquid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cultures of 50% of the patients (19/38) responded to GF stimulation (mean CFU-GM fold increase 15.65+/-48 at week 4) and showed morphological features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and/or dysplastic myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 12/38 cases (31%), complete unresponsiveness to multiple cytokine stimulation was observed; a small number of patients (7/38) showed progressive leukaemic growth along the cultures with the presence of 100% immature blasts at week 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF and c-kit receptors, analysed by immuno-histochemistry in 10 patients, were over-expressed in responding patients and either lacking or down-regulated in non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of cultured interphase cells of nine patients (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in eight patients) showed a clear-cut increase in the percentage of cells with three signals in the two responding patients, thus indicating the expansion of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple cytokine liquid cultures seem to be able to override the refractoriness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells to GF stimulation in many cases, revealing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> which may have prognostic implications and should be considered in ex-vivo and in vivo clinical trials with cytokine combinations </plain></SENT>
