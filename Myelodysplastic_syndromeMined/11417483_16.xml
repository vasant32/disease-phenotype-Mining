<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study two genes, PURA and PURB, encoding functionally cooperative proteins in the Pur family, are localized to chromosome bands 5q31.1 and 7p13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One or both of these loci are shown to be hemizygously deleted in 60 MDS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution mapping of PURA localizes it approximately 1.1 Mb telomeric to the EGR-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequency of PURA deletion and segregation with EGR-1 indicate that PURA is within the most commonly deleted segment in myeloid disorders characterized by del(5)(q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutations have been detected within the coding sequence of PURA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concurrent deletions of PURA and PURB occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at a rate nearly 1.5-fold higher than statistically expected and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at a rate &gt; 5-fold higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This novel simultaneous deletion of two closely related gene family members may thus have consequences related to progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pur alpha, an Rb-binding protein, has been implicated in cell cycle control and differentiation, and Pur alpha and Pur beta are reported to function as heterodimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alterations in these genes could affect a delicate balance critical in myeloid development </plain></SENT>
