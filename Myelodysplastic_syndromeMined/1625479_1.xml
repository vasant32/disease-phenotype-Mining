<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) on differentiation (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> positivity) and proliferation (3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation) were studied in suspension cultures of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve bone marrow donors served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> cells showed spontaneous differentiation in vitro, but only 2/12 were induced to differentiation by D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic cells did not differentiate spontaneously, but cells from 18/34 patients differentiated after incubation with D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> cells showed increased proliferation, myelodysplastic cells showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response and leukemic cells reacted with decreased proliferation after D3 incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor survival was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo>, high percentage of bone marrow blasts (BM blast %), low spontaneous in vitro proliferation and absence of hypogranulation of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts and hypogranulation retained their predictive value in a multi-variate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was predicted by a high BM blast % and low scores for erythroid and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the pattern of in vitro proliferation showed prognostic value while the pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>-induced differentiation failed to correlate to other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An estimation of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be used to predict the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results add to the information about the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may be important for the evaluation of therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
