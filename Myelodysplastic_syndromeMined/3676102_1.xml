<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was studied prospectively in 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) followed for 2-6 years by sequential blast counts, cell kinetics derived from quantitative <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-autoradiography and karyotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> developed in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two distinct patterns of leukaemic evolution were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first was characterized by a gradual increase in blast cell count and in the frequency of labelled blasts, and a corresponding reduction in myeloid maturation index indicating increased intracompartmental myeloblast divisions and premature myeloid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second pattern of leukaemic evolution was marked by a sudden rise in the blast cell population in a previously stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This rise was attributed both to an increased rate of blast proliferation, and the accumulation of non-proliferating blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an additional patient with smouldering ANLL and multiple karyotype abnormalities, transient clinical remission took place following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and oxymetholone therapy, characterized by a sideroblastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, and persistence of a highly abnormal myeloid maturation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sudden emergence of overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in previously stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in some of our patients and the temporary reversal of overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> into sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in one case, lend support to the notion of leukaemic evolution by several steps of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the gradual transition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in other patients is compatible with a single step <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> transformation, although the possibility of clonal disease prior to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cannot be excluded with certainty </plain></SENT>
