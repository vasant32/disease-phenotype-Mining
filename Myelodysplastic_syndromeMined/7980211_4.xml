<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) are typically associated with small vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also found in situations where other autoantibodies are common, sometimes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and possibly in individuals who have received multiple blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e>, where these predisposing factors may be at work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (n = 26), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 3), and myeloproliferative (n = 25) or lymphoproliferative syndromes (n = 16) were screened for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> using a crude neutrophil cytoplasmic extract ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent examination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive results were confirmed by ELISAs for anti-proteinase 3, anti-myeloperoxidase or anti-elastase antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were demonstrated in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> and greater than 5% blasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of these individuals were infected at the time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were demonstrated and other autoantibodies were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these individuals had never had evidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; the other probably developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were demonstrated in one individual with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were also found in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in whom autoantibodies against red cells and platelets were already noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were demonstrated in one further individual with lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>, a condition that resembles Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> clinically and histologically, but which is treated as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were present in any of the patients with myeloproliferative syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> probably occur secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and the lymphoproliferative conditions and they are not necessarily associated with the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
