<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted issues with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) model in relation to the exclusion of many subgroups that now represent a large proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>] with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, prior therapy) and its lack of applicability to most patients on investigational programs, because many would have received prior therapies and would have had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for a significant length of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed 1915 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who were referred from 1993 to 2005 (including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with prior therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 507 patients (26%) had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without prior therapy (ie, classifiable by the IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided randomly into a study group (n = 958) and a test group (n = 957) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in the study group identified the following adverse, independent factors as continuous and categoric values (P&lt;.001): poor performance, older age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, increased bone marrow blasts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, chromosome 7 or complex (&gt;or=3) abnormalities, and prior transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cutoffs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and blasts, and cytogenetic subsets were different according to the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> prognostic model divided patients into 4 prognostic groups with significantly different outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model was validated in the test group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Applying the prognostic score of the new model within the 4 IPSS risk groups, overall, and in patients who had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without prior therapy was found to be highly prognostic in each subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Applying the IPSS within each of the 4 risk groups of the new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> model was not found to be prognostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new model accounts for duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is applicable to any patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at any time during the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
