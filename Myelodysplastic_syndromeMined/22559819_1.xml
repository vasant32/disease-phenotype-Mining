<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) present with lower-risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these patients will initially respond to treatment with growth factors to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> but will eventually cease to respond, while others will be resistant to growth factor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eventually, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients require multiple transfusions and long-term therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While some patients may respond briefly to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, the majority will not, and new therapeutic options are needed for these lower-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our previous clinical trials with ezatiostat (ezatiostat <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, TelentraÂ®, TLK199), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, have shown significant clinical activity, including multilineage responses as well as durable red-blood-cell transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It would be of significant clinical benefit to be able to identify patients most likely to respond to ezatiostat before therapy is initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that by using gene expression profiling and grouping by response, it is possible to construct a predictive score that indicates the likelihood that patients without deletion 5q will respond to lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The success of that study was based in part on the fact that the profile for response was linked to the biology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was available on 30 patients enrolled in the trial and analyzed for gene expression on the Illumina HT12v4 whole genome array according to the manufacturer's protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene marker analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The selection of genes associated with the responders (R) vs. non-responders (NR) phenotype was obtained using a normalized and rescaled mutual information score (NMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that an ezatiostat response profile contains two miRNAs that regulate expression of genes known to be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, pathway analysis of the response profile revealed that the genes comprising the jun-N-terminal kinase/c-Jun molecular pathway, which is known to be activated by ezatiostat, are under-expressed in patients who respond and over-expressed in patients who were non-responders to the drug, suggesting that both the biology of the disease and the molecular mechanism of action of the drug are positively correlated </plain></SENT>
