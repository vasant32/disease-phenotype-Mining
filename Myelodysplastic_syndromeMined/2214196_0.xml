<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His bone marrow was normocellular with 18% blasts, which had Auer rod and were positive for peroxidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation was made according to FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He attained complete remission with aclarubicin and BH-AC and continued it until August 1987 when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male karyotype and gene analysis revealed germ-line configuration of breakpoint cluster region (bcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed in May 1988 when his WBC count increased to 60, 600/microliters with 91% blasts, which were negative for peroxidase staining, positive for anti-Ia and CDw 41 by cell surface analysis, and positive for ultrastructurally demonstrable platelet peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of megakaryocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells showed 46, XY, t(9;22) (q34;q11) and gene analysis revealed rearrangement of bcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He died in November 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results and review of literature suggest that late appearing ph1 chromosome and rearrangement of bcr may occur in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and influence the course of disease </plain></SENT>
