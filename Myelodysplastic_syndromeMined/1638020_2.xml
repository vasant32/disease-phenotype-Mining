<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the growth patterns of blast cell progenitors (CFU-L) in 23 patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 32 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating blast progenitors were identified in 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 81% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary plating efficiencies (PE1) were similar in both disorders, despite marked differences in peripheral blast cell concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By cytological and cytochemical examination, colonies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were indistinguishable from those obtained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle status was assessed by loss of colony formation following short-term exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actively proliferating blast cell progenitors are thus not confined to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, but are also present in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An important difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was found when self-renewal capacity of CFU-L was examined by means of secondary plating efficiencies (PE2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonies could be successfully replated in 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PE2 showed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (2 to 730 colonies/10(5) mononuclear cells), with some values indicating excessive self-renewal capacity of CFU-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 62% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> specimens failed to produce any secondary colony growth, and PE2 in the remaining cases was low (5 to 99/10(5) MNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a different balance between self-renewal and determination could be responsible for a slower pace of clonal expansion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, even if the proliferative activity of clonogenic cells is similar to that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
