<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A fully suitable classification does not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to determine common and different signs of MD and MP type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and to observe frequency of shifts from MD to MP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients were divided according to FAB proposal into two groups: 31 patients into the MD group (WBC &lt; or = 13 x 10(9)/l) and 38 patients into the MP group (WBC &lt; or = 13 x 10(9)/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presenting features and the course of the disease in both groups were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was not different in both groups (71.5 and 74 years, respectively), male/female ratio was 1.1 and 2.4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 15.5 months (1-58.8) in MP group and 24 months (2-118) in MD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MP group <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, abnormal karyotype and skin involvement were found more often than in MD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median LDH value was higher in MP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probability of survival was higher in the MD group than in MP group (median 30 and 11 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>Leukaemia</z:mpath> transformation frequency was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 12 out of 24 (50%) MD group patients WBC increased during the course of the disease over 13 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oscillation of WBC values below and over 13 x 10(9)/l was observed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up time number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and/or immature granulocytes in the PB increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After inclusion of 12 patients who shifted from MD to MP group a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> group resulted characterised by longer median survival (17 months) due to a higher number of patients in an earlier stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Failure of evolution of myeloproliferative signs and lower frequency of AL in the remaining group might be explained by an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, untimely <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to unrelated causes and/or by patients suffering of RA with <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> rather than of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data suggest, that evolution from MD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> to MP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> is a frequent event and that MD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> could be the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> in most of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The WBC at diagnosis as the single criterion for subclassification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> does not seem to be fully justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> should not be divided in MD and MP types and that monitoring of patients and search for other signs of myeloproliferation such as PB immature granulocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, skin involvement, pleural or peritoneal effusions, spontaneous growth of CFU-GM in vitro should be taken in consideration for a better classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, which would have an impact on the therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
