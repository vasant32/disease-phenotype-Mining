<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of MNDA-dim myeloid precursors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases was 67.4% (range, 0.7%-97.5%; interquartile range, 44.9%-82.7%) of myeloid cells, with bimodal MNDA expression in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
