<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> of older, medically non-fit patients still poses a highly unmet clinical need, and only few large, prospective studies have been performed in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the established activity of hypomethylating agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with 20-30% bone marrow blasts, we investigated whether this drug is also active in patients with more than 30% blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in patients over 60 years old with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> ineligible for induction chemotherapy, 227 patients (median age, 72 years), many with comorbidities, adverse cytogenetics and/or preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were treated with this hypomethylating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment (135 mg/m(2) total dose infused intravenously over 72 hours every 6 weeks), a median of two cycles was administered (range, 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> was administered to 100 patients during course 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients who completed four cycles of treatment subsequently received a median of five maintenance courses (range, 1-19) with a lower dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (20 mg/m(2)) infused over 1 hour on 3 consecutive days every 4-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete and partial remission rate was 26%, 95% CI (20%, 32%), and an antileukemic effect was noted in 26% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates did not differ between patients with or without adverse cytogenetics; patients with monosomal karyotypes also responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival from the start of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment was 5.5 months (range, 0-57.5+) and the 1-year survival rate was 28%, 95%CI (22%,34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were predominantly hematologic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> is well tolerated by older, medically non-fit patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> is the major toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The response rate and overall survival were not adversely influenced by poor-risk cytogenetics or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of these encouraging results, randomized studies evaluating single-agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus conventional treatment are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000069 </plain></SENT>
