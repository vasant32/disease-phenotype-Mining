<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (TK) activity with a radioenzyme assay system employing [I-125]-iododeoxyuridine as the tracer on serial specimens from five bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients before and after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum level of TK activity in the 4 patients with effective BMT treatment ranged from 3.0 to 16.9 U/L (mean, 7.80 U/L) before transplantation and from 27.3 to 236.1 U/L (mean, 82.95 U/L) after the BMT treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean serum TK activity increased 13.17-fold (range, 1.68 to 29.14-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the activity in the patient with ineffective BMT treatment was not significantly different during, before, or after BMT treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum TK activity in BMT patients was well correlated with the change in the number of leukocytes before and after BMT treatment [r = +0.709 (p less than 0.01), y = 0.012 x +0.87] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the determination of serum TK activity in BMT patients is very useful in monitoring the course of bone marrow transplantation in the early recovery phase </plain></SENT>
