<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive phage clone which contained the full-length NPM genomic DNA was obtained and the insert of 15.3 kb genomic DNA in this clone was sequenced with shotgun method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BLAST analysis showed that the sequence of insert are 99.8% identity to that of NPM gene of C57BL/6 mouse strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the sequence, bioinformatics analysis on genomic structure of NPM and the transcription factor binding sites in the NPM 5' flanking region were performed </plain></SENT>
