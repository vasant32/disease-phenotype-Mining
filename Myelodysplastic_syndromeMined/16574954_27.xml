<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the usefulness of flow cytometric characteristics of CD34(+) cells for LGw/oRS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells from LGw/oRS patients and controls (eg, cytopenic individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were analyzed using 4-color flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We objectively determined reference ranges of 13 parameters related to CD34(+) cells with data from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In LGw/oRS patients, various abnormalities of CD34(+) cells-eg, decrease in CD34(+) B-cell precursors, aberrant expression or overexpression of various antigens on CD34(+) myeloblasts-were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We constructed a reproducible, flow cytometric scoring system for LGw/oRS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High scores were observed in 16 of 27 LGw/oRS patients, regardless of the presence or absence of chromosomal aberrations, but not in any of the 90 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among LGw/oRS patients with chromosomal aberrations, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or del20(q) had low FCM scores (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, most LGw/oRS patients were identified based on high FCM score, chromosomal aberration, or both </plain></SENT>
