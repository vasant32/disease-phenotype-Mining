<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, a similar proportion of cells express Mcm-2 and Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal states, the proportion of megakaryocytes expressing Mcm-2 is roughly seven times as many as those that express Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is likely to be related to the process of endomitosis and endoreduplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that a significantly lower proportion of megakaryocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> express Mcm-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insights into megakaryocyte biology </plain></SENT>
