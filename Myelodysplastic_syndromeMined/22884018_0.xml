<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Reproductive endocrinology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> unit of a tertiary care university-based medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A 13-year-old premenarcheal female with Tanner stage 3 breast development and Tanner stage 1 pubic hair diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, referred by her medical oncologist for fertility preservation before undergoing a potentially sterilizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Evaluation of ovarian reserve, ovarian stimulation, transvaginal oocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, in vitro maturation of immature oocytes, and oocyte cryopreservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cryopreservation of mature oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Successful controlled ovarian hyperstimulation allowed for the cryopreservation of 18 mature oocytes before the patient's gonadotoxic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The oocyte retrieval and cryopreservation did not delay the patient's planned chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Ovarian stimulation and oocyte cryopreservation can be successfully performed in premenarcheal/peripubertal patients, thus providing a viable alternative to ovarian tissue freezing for fertility preservation in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
