<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients not fulfilling minimal criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) but presenting with persisting cytopenia(s) not attributable to a haematological or non-haematological disease are defined as 'idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance' (ICUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 67 of 3504 patients from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> Registry fulfilling the criteria for ICUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we used the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) to look for clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 67 patients, 66% had unilineage, 18% bilineage and 12% trilineage cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (67%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 44 months (range: 1-199 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the entire group, eight patients (12%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients eligible for HUMARA, 17 had non-clonal X-chromosome inactivation patterns, while 6 patients showed clonal patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these six patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> indicating that a clonal stem cell disorder was the reason for the anteceding cytopenia, while there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> observed among the 17 patients with non-clonal patterns (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since some of the ICUS patients had a clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disease</z:e> when presenting with cytopenia(s) and 8 of 67 patients with ICUS later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, we recommend to follow these patients thoroughly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated here, HUMARA can facilitate the discrimination between ICUS and a 'manifest' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
