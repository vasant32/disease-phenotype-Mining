<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the microvascular density (MVD) and the serum levels of these angiogenic factors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 61 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MVD was measured in bone marrow biopsies and b-FGF, HGF and TNF-alpha were determined in the serum of the same patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of b-FGF, HGF and TNF-alpha as well as MVD in the bone marrow were increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to healthy controls (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of b-FGF, HGF and TNF-alpha were also significantly higher in high-risk for leukemic transformation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in low-risk (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also found regarding MVD in high and low risk patients (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both b-FGF and HGF levels were significant predictors of survival (p&lt;0.0005, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that serum levels of b-FGF, HGF and TNF-alpha are significantly increased and dependent on the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> suggesting that the determination of these parameters may offer considerable information regarding disease progression and prognosis </plain></SENT>
