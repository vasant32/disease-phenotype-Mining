<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the marrow microenvironment in the pathogenesis of the disease has been controversial and no study has been performed so far to characterize mesenchymal cells (MC) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and to analyse their ability to support hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we have isolated and characterized MC at diagnostic marrow samples (n=12) and have purified their CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+ counterparts (n=7) before using MC as a short- and long-term hematopoietic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that MC can be readily isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow and exhibit a major expansion potential as well as an intact osteoblastic differentiation ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They do not harbor the abnormal marker identified by FISH in the hematopoietic cells and they stimulate the growth of autologous clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, highly purified stem cells and their cytokine-expanded progeny harbor the clonal marker with variable frequencies, and both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal long-term culture-initiating cell-derived progeny can be effectively supported by autologous MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow is an abundant source of MC appearing both cytogenetically and functionally noninvolved by the malignant process and able to support hematopoiesis, suggesting their possible usefulness in future cell therapy approaches </plain></SENT>
