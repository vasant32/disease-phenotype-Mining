<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared long-term outcome after unrelated donor transplantation of 85 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> regarding disease status (early disease [CR1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>); n = 25 and advanced/active disease [&gt;CR1, &gt;<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>]; n = 60) who were treated with conventional conditioning regimens followed by bone marrow (BM) or PBSC grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted mainly of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 118Â months (68-174), the 10-year event-free survival rate after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.7%-69.8%), and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), it was 27.9% (14.5%-41.3%; P &lt; .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the advanced/active disease group, the 10-year event-free survival rate after PBSCT was 50% (30.8%-69.2%), and after BMT, it was 23.5% (9.3%-37.8%; P &lt; .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non relapse mortality was less after PBSCT than BMT (14.3% vs 30.2%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox regression analysis, PBSCT showed a better overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.79; P = .007) compared to BMT; unfavorable/unknown prognostic impact cytogenetic abnormalities were an adverse factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (HR, 2.202; 95% CI, 1.19-4.06; P = .011) </plain></SENT>
