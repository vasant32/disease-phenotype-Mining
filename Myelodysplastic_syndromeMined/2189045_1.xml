<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Western blotting analyses with these McAbs were performed on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> T-cell lines were positive in p75c-myb expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-cell lines were variable, myeloid and erythroid cells were positive although the amount of expressed p75c-myb was less than the T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells isolated from patients were positive in expression except for cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> with maturation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypergranular promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M3) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML M6</z:e>) developed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in p75c-myb expression seemed to depend upon the differentiation stage and distinctive lineage from which each cell line had been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p75c-myb expression in HL60 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cell line) showed remarkably high at logarithmic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When examined with HL60, p75c-myb expression significantly decreased during the differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that p75c-myb expression plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation and that multiple mechanisms including aberrant expression of p75c-myb is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
