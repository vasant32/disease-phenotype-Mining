<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on a 6 1/2-year study of bone marrows (BM) from 74 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we have evaluated the role of immunophenotyping (IP) for subclassification purposes with a selected panel of monoclonal antibodies (Mab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM IP revealed increased numbers of Mab-defined immature myeloid cells (defined by Mab MY7 [CD13] and MY9 [CD33] (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, decreased numbers of mature myeloid cells (defined by Mab NAT-9 II:3F-6F [NAT-9]) (P less than 0.001) were demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> French-American-British (FAB) subtypes except refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with sideroblasts (RA-S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since expression of CD13 and CD33 antigens on immature myeloid cells is variable, IP based on a single Mab was often found to be non-informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the construction of myeloid antibody ratios (MAR), designed to give higher figures with increasing numbers of immature myeloid cells and/or decreasing numbers of mature myeloid cells in the BM, disclosed increasing mean ratio values with progressing FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More significant however, was that different prognostic subgroups based on the MAR could be identified independently of the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of IP--especially when MAR is included--is useful in prognostic scoring systems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
