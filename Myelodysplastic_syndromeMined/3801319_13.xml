<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former of these phenomena was found in four cases and was consistently associated with clinical-haematological progression of the disease to a more malignant form, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second was apparently unrelated to clinical and haematological changes in the evolution pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations are in favour of the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolve as a multistep process in which several events, including the acquisition of sometimes unrelated chromosome changes determine the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
