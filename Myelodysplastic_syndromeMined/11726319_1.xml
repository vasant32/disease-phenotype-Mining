<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spontaneous remission (SR) in de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is a rare event, which has been so far described only in children with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon is extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, perhaps depending on different pathogeneses of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 564 consecutive adult patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosed at our Institution in a 12-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SR was defined as an unexpected improvement lasting more than 1 year without concomitant treatments other than vitamins or low-dose steroids (in patients with platelets &lt; 50 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine cases of SR were observed in 3 males and 6 females (median age 38.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had Hb levels &lt; 10 g/dL and 8/9 required packed red cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to SR was 18 months (range 4-46) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had normalization of peripheral blood parameters: in 2 out of 3 patients with karyotypic abnormalities at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a cytogenetic remission was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of SR was 56 months; 5 patients are still in SR and 4 patients have relapsed (1 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 3 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: SR is a rare (less than 2% in our experience) but possible event also in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be kept in mind in the evaluation of experimental treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in which very low rates of complete responses are expected </plain></SENT>
