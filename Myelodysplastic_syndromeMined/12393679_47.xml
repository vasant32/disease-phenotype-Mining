<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disease, familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorder</z:e> with predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (FPD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> patients among A-bomb survivors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> with or without local radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was 2.7% (2 of 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AML1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
