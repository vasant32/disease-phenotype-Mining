<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although both pre-ALL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are preleukemic in a strictly temporal sense, there are several marked differences between the two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present eight children with pre-ALL who represented 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cytogenetic abnormalities were found at the pre-ALL phase, but had developed at the time of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in four of the six children examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings in our patients and on cases reported in the literature, we argue that pre-ALL is likely to represent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030472" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">paraneoplastic syndrome</z:e> early in the leukemic development that might be mediated via inhibitory properties related to clonally expanding but still cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
