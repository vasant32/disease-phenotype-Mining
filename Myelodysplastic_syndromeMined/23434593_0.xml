<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously identified SMAP1 as an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein that functions in clathrin-dependent endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because abnormalities in clathrin-dependent trafficking are often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e>, we targeted Smap1 in mice to examine its physiological and pathological significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Smap1-deficent mice exhibited healthy growth, but their erythroblasts showed enhanced transferrin endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mast cells cultured in SCF, Smap1 deficiency did not affect the internalization of c-KIT but impaired the sorting of internalized c-KIT from multivesicular bodies to lysosomes, resulting in intracellular accumulation of undegraded c-KIT that was accompanied by enhanced activation of ERK and increased cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, approximately 50% of aged Smap1-deficient mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with morphologically dysplastic cells of erythroid-myeloid lineage, which are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some Smap1-deficient mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) of various subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, to our knowledge these results provide the first evidence in a mouse model that the deregulation of clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking may be involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
