<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is found that the methylation rate of SHP-1 promoter of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (69.2%) was higher than that of the low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (21.4%) (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression rate of STAT3 phosphorylated protein of high-risk group was higher (66.7%), when compared with that of the low-risk group (18.2%) (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis showed that the methylation status of SHP-1 promoter is positive correlated with the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient (P&lt;0.001, r=0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in high-risk group, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 3-year overall survival rate of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with SHP-1 methylation was lower than that of patient without SHP-1 methylation (25% vs. 61%) (P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, it is indicated that the SHP-1 methylation plays important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> via activating the JAK/STAT pathway probably and the methylation of SHP-1 promoter is a useful prognostic factor for high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient, with the characteristic of higher methylation lower survival rate </plain></SENT>
