<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using reduced intensity (RI) vs. myeloablative (MA) conditioning for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty two patients (median age 54) who underwent a RI HSCT (2000-2003) were compared with 187 patients (median age 39) who received a MA transplant (1990-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil engraftment was more rapid in the RI group (median 11.5 vs. 21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery was similar and graft failure was infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality was similar though relapse was more frequent after RI conditioning (RR 2.2 [95% CI = 1.1-4.6] P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, disease-free survival (DFS) (31% vs. 30%, P &gt; 0.1) and overall survival (33% vs. 35%, P &gt; 0.1) were comparable between RI and MA groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that RI allografts can yield satisfactory DFS both for older as well as younger patients with pre-existing comorbidities, who are ineligible for MA allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advances in GVHD management and new approaches for relapsed or refractory disease are necessary to improve these outcomes </plain></SENT>
