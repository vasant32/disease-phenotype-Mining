<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process requires engraftment of donor immuno-competent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of achieving engraftment of allogeneic peripheral blood or bone marrow progenitor cell after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog containing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who were not candidates for a conventional myeloablative therapy because of older age or organ dysfunction were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an HLA-identical or one-antigen-mismatched related donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were treated (13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 59 years (range, 27 to 71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were either refractory to therapy or beyond first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d for 4 days with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> at 12 mg/m2/d for 3 days and ara-c at 2 g/m2/d for 4 days (n = 7) or melphalan at 140 mg/m2/d (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received 2-chloro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16335">deoxyadenosine</z:chebi> at 12 mg/m2/d for 5 days and ara-C 1 at g/m2/d for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells and 1 received bone marrow after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated, with only 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from multiorgan failure before receiving stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients achieved a neutrophil count of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L a median of 10 days postinfusion (range, 8 to 17 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ten patients achieved platelet counts of 20 x 10(9)/L a median of 13 days after progenitor cell infusion (range, 7 to 78 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eight patients achieved complete remissions (bone marrow blasts were &lt; 5% with neutrophil recovery and platelet transfusion independence) that lasted a median of 60 days posttransplantation (range, 34 to 170+ days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade &gt; or = 2 occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Chimerism analysis of bone marrow cells in 6 of 8 patients achieving remission showed &gt; or = 90% donor cells between 14 and 30 days postinfusion, and 3 of 4 patients remaining in remission between 60 and 90 days continued to have &gt; or = 80% donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog-containing nonmyeloablative regimens allow engraftment of HLA-compatible hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This approach permits us to explore the graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect without the toxicity of myeloablative therapy and warrants further study in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who are ineligible for conventional transplantation with myeloablative regimens either because of age or concurrent medical conditions </plain></SENT>
