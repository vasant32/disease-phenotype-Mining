<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) has been developed for assessing the prognosis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and has shown satisfactory outcomes for prognostic stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this new system, cytogenetics remains the key stratification parameter and karyotypic abnormalities are classified into five prognostic subgroups with more uncommon cytogenetic subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this system, we analyzed the cytogenetic features of 532 adult Chinese patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and assessed the impacts of the IPSS-R cytogenetic categories on the prognosis of the disease without intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the cytogenetic features of this cohort of Chinese patients are different from those of previously reported Western populations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our Chinese patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was the most common anomaly, and the incidence rate of del(5q) was lower than that in the Western population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the IPSS-R cytogenetic subgroups, the median survival was 59 months for the good risk, 36 months for the intermediate risk, 15 months for the poor risk and 10 months for the very poor risk subgroups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the IPSS-R can effectively stratify the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> based on cytogenetics, but the prognostic significances of some karyotypes in the IPSS-R still need to be confirmed by larger multicenter cooperative studies </plain></SENT>
