<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD34 + selection with magnetic microbeads resulted in 8 × 10(3)/kg residual T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No post-transplant immune suppression was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NK cells recovered rapidly after transplantation (300 CD56+/μL at day 30, median), whereas T cell recovery was delayed (median: 12 CD3+/μL at day 90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NK activity was measured as specific lysis of K 562 targets several times (mean: 3 assays per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four temporal patterns of lytic activity could be differentiated: consistently low, consistently high, decreasing and increasing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with consistently high or increasing activity had significantly lower relapse probability than patients with consistently low or decreasing levels (0.18 vs 0.73 at 2 years, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of patients with ALL showed similar results (0.75 vs 0.14 at 2 years, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Speed of T cell recovery had no influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that both achieving and maintaining a high level of NK activity may contribute to prevent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since NK activity could be markedly increased by in vitro stimulation with Interleukin 2 (IL-2), in vivo administration should be considered </plain></SENT>
