<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the femora was used to investigate the marrow cellularity during the evolution of non-transplanted aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) and hypocellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in order to investigate the relationship between this cellularity and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in adult patients with pancytopaenia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronal T1 weighted and STIR images were obtained, and analysed semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were compared with diagnosis, peripheral blood counts and bone marrow histology at diagnosis and at the time of the MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were examined 2-84 months after diagnosis (median, 16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AA, 11/13 patients showed a fatty, faint or nodular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the majority of the patients (10/14) had a scattered or uniform signal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AA, a significant correlation was found between the degree of femoral cellularity and disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only three cases had diffuse high signal on STIR: among them, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e> and the other developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> 3 months after MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients have died: three with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> presenting a scattered (two cases) or a uniform (one case) MRI signal and one with AA (with a nodular pattern)CONCLUSION: In AA, femoral haemopoiesis is usually not pronounced, and if present, does not contribute to the improvement of blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, patients with discrete femoral haemopoiesis had an improvement in their blood counts with disease duration, similar to that found in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in patients with pronounced femoral cellularity, blood counts remained stable or had deteriorated since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This favours the hypothesis that, as is observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a hypercellular marrow, scattered or uniform marrow patterns in femoral MRI are signs of more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
