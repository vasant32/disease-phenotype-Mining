<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed that SMAD7, a negative regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor-I kinase, is markedly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and leads to ineffective hematopoiesis by overactivation of TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the cause of SMAD7 reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we analyzed the 3'UTR of the gene and determined that it contains a highly conserved putative binding site for microRNA-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed significantly elevated levels of miR-21 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow samples when compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miR-21 was shown to directly bind to the 3'UTR of SMAD7 and reduce its expression in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, we tested the role of miR-21 in regulating TGF-β signaling in a TGF-β-overexpressing transgenic mouse model that develops progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and thus serves as a model of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a chemically modified miR-21 inhibitor led to significant increases in hematocrit and led to an increase in SMAD7 expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of miR-21 also led to an increase in erythroid colony formation from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow progenitors, demonstrating its ability in stimulating hematopoiesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies demonstrate the role of miR-21 in regulating overactivated TGF-β signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
