<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only curative option is SCT, but few reports using UCB as a stem cell source exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> patients transplanted with UCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 was transplanted at seven yr of age due to increasingly large injections of G-CSF (&gt;100 microg/kg/day) and the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He engrafted promptly and is clinically well and immune reconstituted &gt;2 yr post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 underwent UCB SCT at nine months of age for recurrent severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, despite high doses of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He rejected his first graft, having 100% host cells on day +35, and immediately underwent a second UCB SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He engrafted but experienced late graft rejection six months after the second transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He received a third UCB SCT following a more immunosuppressive conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His course was complicated by HHV-6 viremia and gut GVHD, but he is now clinically well and has 99% donor engraftment &gt;20 months post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that UCB is an acceptable stem cell source for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> patients, but conditioning must be adequately immunosuppressive to ensure engraftment in patients without prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
