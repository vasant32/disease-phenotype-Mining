<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the case of 19 patients had evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), while 21 patients (two of them with concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolutions</z:e> was assessed as 3.7%, whereas the incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, age, severity of the disease, and the number of days of rhuG-CSF therapy were the risk factors for AA evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (RR) for very severe AA was approximately seven times higher than that for severe AA (SAA) and non-SAA (NSAA) (P = 0.001), but the latter two did not differ significantly (P = 0.743) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone was monitored sequentially in 237 patients; positive clones were detected in 41% of the patients, but more than half of them were transient or instable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White blood cell count at initial diagnosis was identified as the only significant risk factor for AA evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> for subpopulations of AA patients may be natural evolution as the clinical manifestation and pathogenesis between AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, normalizing hematopoiesis of AA may represent a viable approach to prevent clone evolutions, especially to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
