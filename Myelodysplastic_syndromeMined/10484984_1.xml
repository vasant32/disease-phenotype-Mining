<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified a group of previously not reported chromosome abnormalities related to myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases 1 and 2 were observed to have an additional i(4)(p10) as the sole anomaly with similar clinical features of myeloid disorders; that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL-M2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts in transformation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies with the use of a 4p-specific microdissection probe further confirmed the presence of an i(4)(p10) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 3 was diagnosed with ANLL-M1 and had an additional i(8)(p10) as the only change, also confirmed by a whole-chromosome painting procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases 4-6, deletions of 18q at breakpoints q12, q23, and q21 were identified as the sole anomaly in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>X-autosome translocations other than t(X;10)(p11;p11) and t(X;11)(q13;q23) have not been reported as recurrent or primary changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a t(X;9)(q26;q22) and t(X;5)(q13;q33) as the sole anomaly were found in cases 7 and 8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both cases had the same diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> 4 (+4) and 8 (+8) are common anomalies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ANLL, our findings strongly indicate that amplification of genes on 4p and 8p, but not on 4q and 8q, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, genes on 18q12-23 and on Xq13-26 may be involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
