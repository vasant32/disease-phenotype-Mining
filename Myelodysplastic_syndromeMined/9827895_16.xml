<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is an increasing incidence of the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) from aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) with immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In paediatric patients G-CSF is also reported to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolution, but this process is not precisely understood in children or in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolution in adults are evaluated here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 72 patients, five developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 47 patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CyA) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy, only one developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, 242 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But of 25 patients treated with either CyA or ATG, four developed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 MDS within 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 25 patients, 18 were treated with G-CSF and the four patients (22.2%) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were found in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative dose and the duration of G-CSF administration were significantly elevated in patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when compared with those who did not, 822.3 +/- 185.0 v 205.4 +/- 25.5 microg/kg (P&lt;0.05) and 187.5 +/- 52.5 v 72.0 +/- 24.6 d (P&lt;0.002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However these two values for CyA did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically, treatment with CyA, G-CSF and combined G-CSF and CyA were significantly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The administration of G-CSF for more than a year was the most important factor (P=0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that a close relationship exists between G-CSF and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 MDS from AA in adults who receive immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term administration of G-CSF should be prohibited in order to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
