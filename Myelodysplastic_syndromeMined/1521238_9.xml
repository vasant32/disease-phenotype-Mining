<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analyses were performed in five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 during the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 at the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the remaining one had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> phase developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of bone marrow (BM) cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in the four patients who showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis fluctuated, and this fluctuation was not related to the percentage of blasts in the BM or to progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in two patients, metaphase cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 disappeared when their anemic state improved, although leuko-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was still present, suggesting that the decrease in the number of BM cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 reflects hematologic features in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was possibly not the primary event in the genesis of the disease, and that there may have been competition between a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype clone and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>-8-positive clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results further suggest that the presence of a clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 is not always a sign of disease progression or of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
