<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Soluble receptors have been identified for most members of the TNF-receptor/NGF receptor superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) is of particular importance, since its triggering may induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a soluble form of the CD95 molecule was described which interacts with the CD95-CD95 ligand <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased concentrations of soluble CD95 (sCD95) were previously detected in some patients with T and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated sCD95 in the serum of patients with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, myeloproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 72 patients was studied (29 AML, 17 MDS, 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and six other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with active disease, the levels of sCD95 tended to be elevated, but did not correlate with defined clinical or laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other disorders, the levels of sCD95 were not generally increased, although some patients had elevated levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that sCD95 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients is not derived from leukemic cells, but is possibly secreted or shed from reactive or stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is also supported by a group of eight patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who had elevated sCD95 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with elevated sCD95 who had undergone chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this study shows that measuring soluble Fas-receptor in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is not diagnostically useful, but increased sCD95 may be associated with clinical complications like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
