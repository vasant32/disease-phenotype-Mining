<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male type on the initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) initially increased the peripheral neutrophil count, bat in January 1993, although blast cells did not increase, neutrophils had decreased in spite of the continuation of G-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis showed 46XY, +Y, -7 at this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By adding 50 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> ocfosfate (SPAC) daily, the peripheral neutrophil count again rose dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and the chromosomal abnormality were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SPAC may upregulate the effect of G-CSF on granulopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
