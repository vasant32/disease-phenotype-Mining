<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few studies have evaluated the activity of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase II trial of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 in 26 patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB 1</z:e>: n = 4; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB 2</z:e>: n = 9; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> having progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: n = 10; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>: n = 3) who could not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy consisted of four courses of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 given intravenously at 200 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were: median age, 71 (range 51-77); sex, (M/F), 21/5, median % marrow blasts cells, 13.5 (range 7-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics according to IPSS were: low-risk n = 13, intermediate-risk n = 6, high-risk n = 3, failure or not done n = 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients stopped treatment after only one or two courses of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 2), progressive disease (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lysis syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 20 patients who received at least three cycles of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11, complete remission was achieved in one case, partial remission in four cases, and hematological improvement in three cases with an overall response rate of 33% in the 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration of response was short (median 4 months, range 1-6 months) and median survival was 8 months (range 1-23 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Digestive toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>) occurred in 26/89 (29%) courses, but was mild (grade 1, 20% courses; grade 2 or 3, 9% courses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicity was difficult to assess in non-responders because of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients who responded had grade 3/4 hematological toxicity associated with grade &gt;/=2 infection requiring hospitalization in 18% of the courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other major toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 has an interesting activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with excess of blasts; toxicity is easily managed and most patients can be treated in the out-clinic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that further evaluation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is warranted </plain></SENT>
