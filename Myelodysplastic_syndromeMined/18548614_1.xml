<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment of sequential pulls of bone marrow aspirates from the same patient show decreasing proportions of blasts that are detected in later specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this problem, the intensity of CD16 on maturing neutrophils was compared for bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood, and bone marrow aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison between bone marrow biopsy and aspirate specimens from the same individuals showed similar proportions of neutrophils with mature phenotype in most, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other cell populations (total mature lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and blasts) were also similar between the two specimen types, with one exception of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, exhibiting a unique blast population in the biopsy that was not evident in the aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of mature myeloid cells expressing a mature neutrophil phenotype (high levels of CD16) was found to be 17% (±6.7, n=47) in trephine marrow biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, marrow aspirates contained more of the mature neutrophil phenotype (38%±16, n=33) with about 1/3 of the aspirates indistinguishable from biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a simple formula to normalize the aspirate specimens to the average neutrophil composition of marrow biopsies, it was possible to correct for the dilutional effect of added blood to both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow aspirates and aspirates with elevated blast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest three alternative means of circumventing the problem of blood dilution of marrow aspirate specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1) Blast counts by flow cytometry can be obtained from disaggregated biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) A bone marrow aspirate can be assessed for the proportion of mature neutrophils present and only those with low proportions (&lt;30%) of phenotypic mature neutrophils are considered adequate for blast counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) The aspirates with high proportions of mature neutrophils may be normalized based on the proportion of dim CD16 maturing myeloid cells to a level observed in bone marrow biopsies (based on an average mature neutrophil composition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such an approach for identifying the amount of hemodilution in each specimen may enhance the utility of flow cytometry in enumeration of blasts in bone marrow, especially in cases where myeloblast count is crucial for prognosis, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
