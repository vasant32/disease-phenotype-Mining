<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the reliability and sensitivity of the high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) technique for the identification of the SF3B1 mutations, mutations in 92 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were detected in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity could reach 5%, obviously higher than the 25% of direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A low frequency (5.4%) of SF3B1 mutations were identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including three cases of K700E, one case of H662Q, and one case of K666M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, SF3B1 mutations were more frequently recurrent in the 33% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> characterized with RS, whereas in other subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, only 2.3% of patients were detected with SF3B1 mutations (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and high-throughput HRMA assay has been established for the scanning of SF3B1 mutations </plain></SENT>
