<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were identified out of a group of 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as part of a phase I/II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsies were obtained before and after one or more courses of GM-CSF at 250 micrograms/m2 administered as a 12-h infusion each day for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were blindly evaluated and reticulin formation and collagen deposition were graded on a scale of 0-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>Fibrosis</z:mp> unequivocally increased in three patients and decreased in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were equivocal increases in an additional two patients and decreases in one subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was unchanged in one subject and unevaluable in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although patients in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> increased tended to have smaller increases in neutrophil and reticulocyte counts on therapy, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this small group of patients, it was not possible to determine clinical features that predicted response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although GM-CSF can lead to partial resolution of marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in some individuals, it can also accelerate its deposition; improvement in granulocyte or reticulocyte count does not preclude increasing marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of GM-CSF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> must be undertaken with caution </plain></SENT>
