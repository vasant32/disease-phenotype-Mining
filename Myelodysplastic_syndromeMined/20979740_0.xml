<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The flow cytometric data of bone marrow samples from 168 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and 77 cases of AA were analyzed retrospectively in blind, and its results were compared with gold standard to evaluate its diagnosis values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The specificity of abnormal of single immunophenotype in the surface of granulocytes and myeloblasts was high (range 75.3%-100%), but the sensitivity was very low (range 5.4%-50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel tests, the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of CD34+ cells≥1%, myeloblasts≥3%, abnormal expression of CD117 in granulocytes and loss of CD13 in myeloblasts or increased intensity of CD33 in granulocytes were higher than other combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of above combination were more than 62% and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the scoring method, different score was given to 8 markers according to different diagnostic value, which were CD34+ cells≥1%, myeloblasts≥3%, abnormal expression of CD117 in granulocytes, loss of CD13 in myeloblasts, increased intensity of CD33 in granulocytes, loss of CD13 in granulocytes, loss of CD10 in granulocytes, and decreased SSC in granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity were both high if we defined that the total score≥1.5 was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and the score&lt;1.5 was AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The value of abnormal of single immunophenotype for differential diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and AA is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parallel tests can increase the diagnostic sensitivity obviously and not decrease the specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cells≥1%, myeloblasts≥3% and abnormal expression of CD117 in granulocytes were the most important markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The scoring method is precise to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> from AA </plain></SENT>
