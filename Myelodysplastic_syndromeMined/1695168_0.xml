<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study covered 94 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the factors related to patients' survival, Cox Multiple Regression analysis was performed by the BMD P2L program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When analyzing by means of actuarial curves the survival probability of patients with benign development versus those of malignant development (those who developed ANLL), the significance between both groups was p = 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different variables of patients included in this study were analyzed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed great significances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fab: p = 0.0022, disease evolution: p = 0.0001 and presence of blastic aggregates: p = 0.0011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox's regression analysis revealed that the only predictable survival variable is the presence of blastic colonies and/or clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, two groups were constructed: favourable and unfavourable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the favourable group, 40% of the patients belonged to the RA group, while in the unfavourable group, 55% belonged to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows the validity of the elaboration of prognostic groups in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to the presence of blastic colonies and/or clusters in CFUGM medullary and/or peripheral cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The "in vitro" myeloid progenitors culture techniques may therefore be advantageously applied in these disorders for formulating a diagnosis and predicting the patient's short term evolution </plain></SENT>
