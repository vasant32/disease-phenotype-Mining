<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes result in the hemizygous deletion of genetic material from 12p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We mapped a yeast artificial chromosome containing the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene, a cosmid contig containing part of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> and a P1 contig containing the KIP1 gene to 12p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These probes were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization to analyze samples from 47 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> who had unbalanced translocations (25 patients) leading to loss of 12p or deletions (22 patients) involving 12p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (8 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; 11 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; 10 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (4 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (7 cases), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 cases), and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> (5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three probes were hemizygously detected in 26 cases and were completely retained in only 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases probes for one of the two genes were deleted, allowing us to map the smallest region of overlap of these deletions to a small genomic region that is bordered on the telomeric side by the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene and on the centromeric side by KIP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genomic distance between <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> and KIP1 is estimated to be about 1 to 2 Mbp </plain></SENT>
