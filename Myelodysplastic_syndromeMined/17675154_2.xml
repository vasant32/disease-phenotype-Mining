<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the influence on overall survival of the expression of lineage and maturation-associated antigens of BM hemopoietic cells quantified in a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the univariate Cox regression the peripheral platelet count was a significant favourable factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable prognostic factors were: WPSS, increase in BM CD34+ cells, increased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD13 on myelocytes, metamyelocytes and mature neutrophils as well as increased CD45 of myelocytes and mature neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a model containing platelet count, WPSS and MFI of CD45 and CD13 on mature neutrophils, only hyperexpression of CD13 and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, phenotypic features that can also be obtained from PB might be useful for predicting survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
