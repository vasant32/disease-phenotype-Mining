<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), carried out with an alphoid DNA probe specific for chromosome 7 centromere, showed that a small marker chromosome present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells' karyotype of the three patients, was derived from the missing chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two cases, the marker was a ring chromosome, whereas in the third case it was a tiny dot-like chromosome, unnoticed at first examination on R-banded metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the three cases, the marker was lost in a proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH experiments suggested that the marker centromere had undergone structural alterations, with a fluorescence pattern distinct from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the whole, these data suggest that: firstly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 results, in a proportion of cases, from a structural event rather than from simple loss of a whole chromosome 7; secondly, interpretation of interphase FISH must be cautious in <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 evaluation; and thirdly structural alteration of the chromosome 7 derivative alphoid DNA could explain its propensity to segregate unequally and to be lost at mitosis </plain></SENT>
