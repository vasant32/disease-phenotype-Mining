<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mitogenesis was significantly depressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to controls (p less than .001) and a similar defect was found in a small group of patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) (p less than .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impaired mitogenic response ability of T-cells in these patients did not appear to be the result of alteration in lymphocyte subpopulation ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed defect might result from defective cooperation between T-lymphocytes and abnormal myeloid elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the lymphocytes themselves could be derived from the abnormal clone and thus be functionally abnormal </plain></SENT>
