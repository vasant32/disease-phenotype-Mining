<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nuclear signalling pathways of RA and D3 are mediated through their cognate receptors, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> receptor (RAR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> receptor (VDR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">Retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor (RXR) is an auxiliary factor that forms a heterodimer with RAR and VDR, enabling their efficient transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>9-cis RA, a high-affinity ligand for RXR, greatly enhanced D3-induced CD14 expression in U937 cells, while RA alone did not induce CD14 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>9-cis RA also resulted in morphological changes of U937 cells to macrophage-like cells when combined with D3, while RA alone resulted in granulocyte-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RA and D3 together enhanced c-fms expression, phagocytic activity, and acted synergistically to promote <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction activity and inhibit proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis showed that U937 cells constitutively expressed RAR-alpha, VDR and RXR-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RA or D3 alone or in combination did not affect RAR-alpha and VDR expression, while 9-cis RA and 9-cis RA plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans RA significantly reduced RXR-alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, D3 could restore the down-regulation of RXR-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by 9-cis RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that there is crossover of the nuclear signalling pathways of RA and D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have clinical implications in that RA and D3 may be used in combination for differentiation-inducing therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
