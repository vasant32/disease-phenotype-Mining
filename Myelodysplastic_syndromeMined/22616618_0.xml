<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here two children affected by t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after chemo/radiotherapy for a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e>, both with an unbalanced translocation 1/6 in their bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characterization by array comparative genomic hybridization of the imbalances showed an almost identical pattern: almost complete <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the long arm of chromosome 1, and a terminal deletion and interstitial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gain of chromosome 6 short arm encompasses regions already highlighted as possibly relevant for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in adults, and we suggest that the unbalanced translocation reported here be considered a new recurrent, non-random chromosomal abnormality in pediatric patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
