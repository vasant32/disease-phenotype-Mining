<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promising results in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> have been obtained using high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the molecular basis of the response to rhEPO, we used commercially available macro-arrays to investigate gene expression profiles in the glycophorin-expressing (Gly+) bone marrow (BM) erythroid cells of five responders (ERs) and five non-responders (ENRs) to rhEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells were separated by means of positive selection using an immunomagnetic procedure, after which flow cytometry showed that their purity was more than 97% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The array data were validated by means of real time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the genes responsible for proliferation/differentiation and DNA repair/stability were repressed in the BM Gly+ erythroid cells of the ENRs, but almost normally expressed in the ERs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in signal transduction suggested that the activity of the MAPK signaling pathway is inhibited in ERs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The different gene expression profiles of ERs and ENRs may provide a basis for early gene testing as a means of predicting the response to rhEPO of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low endogenous EPO levels </plain></SENT>
