<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following short-term culture of bone marrow cells, karyotypic analysis was carried out with R-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>20q- and t(20;21) (q11;q11) was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using dual-color 20q11/12 probe, ST 20qter /ST 21qter probes, SE20(D20Z1)/SE 13/21 probes, and WC20/WC21 probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six (2.3%) of the 257 patients with 20q- detected by conventional karyotypic analysis were found to have t(20;21) (q11;q11) abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Above results were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: i (20q-), t(20;21) (q11;q11) seems to be a rare but recurrent chromosomal abnormality which is specifically associated with myeloid disease, late occurrence and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The translocation between chromosome 20q11 and 21q11 may form a novel fusion gene which has an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
