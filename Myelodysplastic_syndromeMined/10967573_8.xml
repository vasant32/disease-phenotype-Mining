<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL (crude rate at 2.8%) including two lymphoblastic AL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean time of occurrence was at 32 months after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and 71 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated actuarial incidence at 10 years was at 6.3% (+/-4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping revealed complex chromosomal aberrations in only one patient, and two translocations [t(8;21) and t(8;16)] </plain></SENT>
