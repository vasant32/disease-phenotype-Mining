<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML) and clonal karyotypic abnormalities, have been recognized as relatively frequent and potentially serious complications of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 66 patients, undergoing PBPCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, NHL, MM or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients reported in this study had to be in continuous complete remission after transplantation without receiving chemo-radiotherapy or other biological response modifiers, had to show absence of cytogenetic abnormalities and myelodysplastic features at transplantation and had to have at least 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the bone marrow, peripheral blood, cytogenetics and clonality (HUMARA) 12 months after the transplant and thereafter every 12 months or every 6 months if lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, clonal or cytogenetic abnormalities were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not observe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML, according to the FAB classification, in 163 assessments of 66 patients over a median follow-up of 25 months (range 12-106) after PBPCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients showed lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>: six patients had dyserythropoiesis, 2 patients dysgranulopoiesis, one dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, two patients showed double lineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (erythroid and granulocytic), and one patient showed dysgranulopoiesis at the first control acquiring dyserythropoiesis at the next follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found three cytogenetic abnormalities in the absence of concomitant dysplastic features: transient -5q, -Y, fra(10)(q25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The female patient with the cytogenetic abnormality -5q showed transient unbalanced clonality by HUMARA assay; further controls documented normalization of both clonality and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML depends on a variety of risk factors such as the number and type of prior courses of chemo-radiotherapy, total body irradiation in conditioning regimen, cytogenetic and morphologic alterations prior to transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may account for the difference in reporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of exposure to recognized risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML in our patients may account for the absence of this complication in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We consider that the use of stringent morphologic criteria, especially during the first period after PBPCT, combined with cytogenetic, clonality and FISH analyses are necessary for a correct diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to overcome the limitations of the FAB and WHO classifications in this setting </plain></SENT>
