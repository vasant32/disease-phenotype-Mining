<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CFU-Meg, BFU-E, and CFU-E colony growths were disturbed more often than the CFU-GM colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A CFU-E increase was not recognized in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, but a dose-dependent increase of bone marrow CFU-Es in response to erythropoietin (EPO) was recognized only in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) patients whose CFU-Es were more than one tenth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
