<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of FAB subtypes was: 44 RA, 40 RARS, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, and five not specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline haematocrit was 24.5%, and the mean prestudy transfusion requirement in the 12 weeks immediately prior to study entry was 6.5 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>r-HuEpo treatment was initiated at a dose of 150 U/kg three times weekly, with dose escalations of 50 U/kg monthly (up to 300 U/kg 3x/week) permitted if the haematocrit failed to rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy was defined as either an increase in haematocrit of &gt; or = 6 percentage points over baseline, unrelated to transfusion, or a &gt; or = 50% decrease in transfusion requirement in the last 3 months of study treatment, compared to the baseline period (12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By these criteria, 28% (28/100) of patients responded to r-HuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 86% (24/28) of patients responding to therapy had baseline Epo levels &lt; or = 100 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates by FAB subtype were: RA 39% (17/44), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> 17.5% (7/40) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 12.5% (1/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a 54% (15/28) response rate was seen in RA patients with baseline Epo levels &lt; or = 100 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses to therapy were durable and generally occurred at r-HuEpo doses of 150-200 U/kg t.i.w </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no reports of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data show that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially those with the RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> subtypes, can benefit from treatment with r-HuEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those patients with baseline Epo levels &lt; or = 100 mU/ml were most likely to respond to therapy </plain></SENT>
