<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 32), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid and myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 4), and various nonmalignant diseases (n = 10) underwent transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mobilized peripheral-blood stem cells were selected with either anti-CD34- or anti-CD133-coated microbeads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of 19.5 x 10(6) purified cells and &lt;25,000 CD3+ T lymphocytes per kilogram, with no regular posttransplant pharmacological immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment occurred in 98% of patients (primary sustained engraftment, 83%; engraftment after reconditioning/stem cell boosts, 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors but one had a stable three-lineage engraftment with a median follow up of 4.1 years (range 0.6-8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) grade II was seen in only 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No severe primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD grades III-IV occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen percent of the patients developed transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years was 60% for patients with nonmalignant diseases and 48% for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL)/non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in complete remission (CR)1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the ALL/NHL patients with active disease survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> had a poorer outcome (3-year DFS = 18%), whereas two of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapse probability of the whole group was not significantly increased when compared to a historical control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was 18% between 1995 and 2002 and has since been reduced to 8% by the introduction of new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In summary, the use of stem cells from haploidentical parental donors should be strongly considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children who need transplantation but lack an identical donor </plain></SENT>
