<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little that can be done therapeutically, and the prognosis for patients with this disease is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main hematologic finding is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> responds poorly to the various kinds of drugs used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and in the past it was called <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 25% to 40% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, so <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has also been referred to as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e> or a preleukemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> are classified as either erythrocytic or leukocytic, it is often unclear into which category <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> sometimes occurs in young adults and children, it most often appears in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is confirmed in laboratory tests by a reduction in peripheral blood cells, an abundance of cells in the bone marrow (cellular marrow), abnormal cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In primary cases there is no history of underlying disease or administration of drugs that is toxic to the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The course of the disease is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> but irreversible, and in a high percentage of cases it either develops into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or the patient succumbs to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood cells arise from a single type of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell in the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the hematopoietic stem cells acquire mutations and cannot produce sufficient numbers of mature blood cells (Fig. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> the hematopoietic stem cells are also abnormal, and blood cell production in the marrow generally declines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, however, there are sufficient numbers of blood cells of each lineage along the path from hematopoietic stem cell to mature blood cell, but the cells do not completely mature and differentiate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of this deficiency in the differentiation process, the cells die in the marrow without maturing and differentiating (ineffective hematopoiesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, blood cells that escape <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the bone marrow and are released into the peripheral blood have both morphological and functional abnormalities compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In other words, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is an abnormality at the hematopoietic stem cell level, and it is characterized by the presence of clonal blood cells that are abnormal both in quality (<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, function, differentiation) and quantity (cytopenia) [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Because these abnormalities are found in multiple blood cell lineages, they are believed to be clonal abnormalities that originate in the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The reason why the stem cells become abnormal is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can arise following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> or radiation treatments (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e>), and it has been proposed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is caused by cumulative DNA damage in stem cells from mutagenic substances such as antitumor drugs [2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should begin with the fact that there is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, progressive cytopenia, the marrow is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or hyperplastic, and there is no underlying disease (such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen disorder</z:e>, etc.) that could otherwise cause these conditions (Table 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is most likely to occur in middle-aged and elderly patients, but because it can also occur in the young, age is not a determining factor for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is verified by ineffective hematopoiesis and blood cells with morphological abnormalities in the marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although there are, for example, ferrokinetic studies for erythroid cells, etc., it is impossible to make an accurate evaluation of ineffective hematopoiesis based only on abnormal laboratory test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cytopenia and cellular marrow are both present, then abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of blood cells becomes the deciding factor in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Typical morphological abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> include megaloblasts (photo 1), dissociated maturation of the nucleus and cytoplasm (photo 2), abnormal multinucleated erythroblasts with three or more nuclei (photo 1), and ringed sideroblasts (photo 3) in the erythrocytic lineage; hypersegmented (photo 4) or hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo Pelger-HuÃ«t nuclear anomaly, photo 5), reduced or missing granules (photos 4 and 5), and peroxidase-negative neutrophils in the granulocytic lineage; and micromegakaryocytes (photo 6), megakaryocytes with multiple, isolated disc-shaped nuclei (photo 7) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001902'>giant platelets</z:hpo> (photo 8) in the megakaryocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, these morphological abnormalities are not specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and they are also seen in pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> must exclude these other diseases with which we are already familiar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Once <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is confirmed, then the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is determined in accordance with FAB classification [1] (Fig. 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis applies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases presenting with cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, etc., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, etc., as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, etc., can <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> based on their characteristic symptoms and laboratory test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, atypical forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> [3, 4] also occur, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, amegakaryocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Meticulous microscopic examination of blood cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and careful observation of the clinical course are essential, in addition to bone marrow biopsy, chromosomal studies of marrow cells, blood cell clonality analysis, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: APOPTOSIS: One biological characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is the presence of blood cells of abnormal clones derived from abnormal hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These abnormal clones demonstrate ineffective hematopoiesis, which is reflected in the contradictory phenomena of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or hyperplastic bone marrow concurrent with cytopenia in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is a result of premature cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the bone marrow that accompanies the abnormal blood cell differentiation found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it has been proposed that it is very likely this early cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> takes the form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and, little by little, experimental results supporting this view have been published [5-7] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>ONSET AND PROGRESSION: Unstable clones with functional deficiencies are produced by abnormal stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>From the standpoint of chromosomal research, it is believed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurs not from a single type of stem cell damage, but from an accumulation of multiple and random stem cell damage </plain></SENT>
