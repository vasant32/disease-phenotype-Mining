<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observation and supportive care with blood products and antibiotics, when necessary, continue to be the mainstays of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>, a cell-cycle specific ring analog of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26440">pyrimidine nucleoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>, as a continuous intravenous infusion, 75 mg/m2 per day for 7 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were seen in 21 (49%) of 43 evaluable patients: five (12%) in complete remission (CR, complete normalization of bone marrow and peripheral blood counts); 11 (25%) in partial remission (PR, &gt; or = 50% restoration of the deficit from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three peripheral blood cell lines, elimination of transfusion requirements, and a decrease in percentage bone marrow blasts by &gt; or = 50% from prestudy values); five (12%) improved (&gt; or = 50% restoration in the deficit from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of one or more peripheral blood cell lines and/or a &gt; or = 50% decrease in transfusion requirements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trilineage improvement (CR and PR) occurred in 37% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 13.3 months and the median duration of remission for those with CR and PR was 14.7 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior to treatment, bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells were assayed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colonies derived from erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-e) were undetectable in one patient and reduced in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of colonies derived from erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-e)) were also reduced in two of the three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the two patients with detectable colony growth prior to treatment, colony number decreased by day 8 of the first cycle, followed by a subsequent increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Continued treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> led to normalization of the number of CFU-e derived colonies as well as an increase in the number of BFU-e derived colonies </plain></SENT>
