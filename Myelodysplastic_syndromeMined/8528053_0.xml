<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of long-term treatment with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) in 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily subcutaneous injection of 60 micrograms/m2, 125 micrograms/m2 or 250 micrograms/m2 for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in granulocyte counts including neutrophils and eosinophils was shown from one week after the start of the treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in granulocyte counts reached a plateau at the 4th week and was sustained during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no consistent change in other cell lineages including monocytes, lymphocytes, reticulocytes and platelets were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless peak-levels of these cells were significantly higher than the pre-treatment levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In higher dose groups, the number of patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events among the 3 dose groups, and the toxicity was generally well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that treatment with rhGM-CSF can be of potential therapeutic benefit to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
