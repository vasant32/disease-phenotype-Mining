<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> incorporates morphologic, cytogenetic, immunologic and clinical features to define the entities that are biologically homogeneous and that have clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival tissues from 70AML patients during the period of 1995 to 2003 were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtype was classified, defined by World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, including age, gender, treatment and outcome, were scrutinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 37 males and 33 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease was 49 years (range, 2-78 years), which was younger in biphenotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (23.5 years) and older in multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 9 cases (13%) with recurrent cytogenetic abnormality, 7 (10%) multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-related, 7 (10%) therapy-related, 39 (56%) not other categorized and 8 (11%) of ambiguous lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were 26.5% and 20.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtype was a significant parameter to determine survival (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survivals of therapyrelated, multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-related and biphenotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were 2 months, 9 months and 30.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This was a clinicopathologic study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtype plays a significant prognostic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>- and therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> have worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Biphenotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> may not be an aggressive subtype </plain></SENT>
