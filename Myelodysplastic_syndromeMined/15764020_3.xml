<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods Thirty-three patients [median age 42 years, range 23-55 years, diagnosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) 14, ALL nine, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> seven and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) three] received myeloablative conditioning followed by infusion of selected CD34+ cells from matched unrelated donors (31) or HLA-identical siblings (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI; 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(6) CD3+ cells/kg) were given while patients were on immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-seven per cent of patients engrafted and 24 of 29 patients surviving more than 30 days received at least one pre-emptive DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (10%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (a)GvHD (two grade I-II, one grade III-IV) spontaneously, and 16 patients (67%) developed aGvHD after DLI (12 grade I-II, four grade III-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 24 evaluable patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (c)GvHD (33%, six limited, two extensive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 590 days (range 138-1610 days) 18 patients were alive (55%), 16 in complete remission (CR), one in hematologic and one in molecular relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died after relapse (21%) and eight died from transplantation-related causes (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> had a significantly better survival than patients with ALL or MM (74%+/-10 vs. 30%+/-13, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Early pre-emptive low-dose DLI following transplantation of selected CD34+ cells from unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning is feasible and effective without undue toxicity, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
