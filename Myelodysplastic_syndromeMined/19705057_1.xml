<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (5 with transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>; 6 with transfusion-independent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>) received once daily oral administrations of 10 mg of lenalidomide for 21 consecutive days in a 28-day treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was assessed by the IWG criteria </plain></SENT>
