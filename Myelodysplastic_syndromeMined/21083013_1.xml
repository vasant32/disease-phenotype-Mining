<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laromustine is metabolized to yield 90CE and methylisocyanate, the former rapidly produces an alkylating, chloroethylating species, similar to the chloroethylating species generated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several features distinguish laromustine from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi> and possibly account for their biological differences in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chloroethylating species responsible for laromustine's alkylator effect is relatively specific for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> and forms a crosslink after incorporation into DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laromustine has significant activity in both older patients with previously untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, including those with very poor-risk disease, and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies are required with laromustine to evaluate its place as an anticancer agent in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
