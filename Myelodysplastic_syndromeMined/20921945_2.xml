<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 51% of patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease status before transplantation was CR or PR 71 with 29% transplanted with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to three published prognostic indexes: (1) hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI); (2) European BMT (EBMT) score; and (3) Pretransplantation Assessment of Mortality (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 100-day and 1-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) were 6 and 22%, respectively, for the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year OS and PFS were 60 and 58%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 46 and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, neither the HCT-CI nor the EBMT score, nor the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> score were predictive of TRM and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the occurrence of aGVHD affected the TRM and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ALLO-RIC is feasible in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even if those prognostic scores were not adapted to elderly patients, they did not predict for TRM and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>aGVHD is the main cause of TRM and more efforts should be made to reduce its incidence without sacrificing graft vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
