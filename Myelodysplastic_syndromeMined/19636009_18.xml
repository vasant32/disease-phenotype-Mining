<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of high-dose [(131)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine ([(131)I]MIBG) in the treatment of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> (PHEO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paraganglioma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with metastatic PHEO or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGL</z:e>, age 10 to 64 years, were treated with [(131)I]MIBG doses ranging from 492 to 1,160 mCi (median, 12 mCi/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative [(131)I]MIBG administered ranged from 492 to 3,191 mCi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous hematopoietic stem cells were collected and cryopreserved before treatment with [(131)I]MIBG greater than 12 mCi/kg or with a total dose greater than 500 mCi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine [(131)I]MIBG infusions were given, which included infusions to 35 patients treated once and infusions to 15 patients who received two or three treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response was evaluated by [(123)I]MIBG scans, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>/metanephrines, and chromogranin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) rate in 49 evaluable patients was 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 35% of patients achieved a CR or PR in at least one measure of response without progressive disease, and 8% of patients maintained stable disease for greater than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent of patients experienced progressive disease within 1 year after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicities included grades 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (87%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grades 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011945'>bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although serious toxicity may occur, the survival and response rates achieved with high-dose [(131)I]MIBG suggest its utility in the management of selected patients with metastatic PHEO and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
