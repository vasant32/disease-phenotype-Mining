<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then Fas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were examined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma levels in BM of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> both increased, the former produced by cells CD4+CD45RO+, CD8+CD45RO+, the latter by cells CD4+CD45RO+, CD8+CD45RO+, CD8+CD45RA+, in which the cells CD8+CD45RO+ were dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression had relationship with IFN-gamma produced by T cells but not with TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in hematopoietic microenvironment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, not only the T lymphocyte subsets are in disorder, but also negative regulatory factors secreted by T lymphocyte increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes play an important role in producing IFN-gamma in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
