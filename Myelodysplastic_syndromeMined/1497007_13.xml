<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> in the conventional prolonged infusion over 4 to 6 hours is complicated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> and chills in 50% to 90% of patients and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> toxicities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased creatinine</z:hpo> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> in 60% to 80% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the safety and toxicity of rapid infusions, we conducted a prospective, nonrandomized study in patients with clinical indications for antifungal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five granulocytopenic adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were enrolled in a phase I trial using four sequentially shorter infusion durations: a standard infusion over 4 hours (n = 3) and shortened infusion durations at 3 hours (n = 3), 2 hours (n = 4), and 1 hour (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was assessed by daily examinations of study subjects by one of the study investigators, by documentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infusion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> and chills, and by daily monitoring of serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Temperatures greater than 38 degrees C occurred in 16 of 25 (64%) patients, but only two had temperatures exceeding 40 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chills were observed in 13 of 25 (56%) patients, but only one had severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increased more than 0.5 mg/dL (44.20 mumol/L) above the pretreatment baseline in 17 of 25 (68%) patients, and the absolute <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level was greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 mumol/L) in 10 of 25 (40%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels dropped below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit of 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but no patient had <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels below 2.5 mEq/L (2.5 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> supplementation was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and exceeded 100 mEq/d in 12 of 25 (48%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid infusions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> are safe, are associated with similar toxicity as prolonged infusions, and facilitate inpatient care by decreasing nursing time needed for administration and minimizing scheduling conflicts with other necessary intravenous medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Shorter infusions also facilitate outpatient and home administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
