<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) show a disturbed differentiation pattern and are generally dysfunctional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study these defects in more detail, we investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26523">reactive-oxygen species</z:chebi> (ROS) production and F-actin polymerization in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy controls and the involvement of N-formyl-L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-L-lucyl-L-phenylaline (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>) and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-stimulated signal transduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> stimulation, similar levels of respiratory burst, F-actin polymerization, and activation of the small GTPase Rac2 were demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, GM-CSF and G-CSF priming of ROS production were significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We subsequently investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in ROS generation and demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated ROS production was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, but not by the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ROS production induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> stimulation of GM-CSF-primed cells was inhibited by LY294002 and U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This coincides with enhanced protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) phosphorylation that was PI3K dependent and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation that was PI3K independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated higher protein levels of the PI3K subunit p110 in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and found that though the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and ERK1/2 could also be enhanced by pretreatment with GM-CSF in these patients, the degree and kinetics of PKB/Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were significantly disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These defects were observed despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GM-CSF-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the reduced priming of neutrophil ROS production in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients might be caused by a disturbed convergence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> and GM-CSF signaling routes </plain></SENT>
