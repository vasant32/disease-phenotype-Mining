<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proliferative activity of the haematopoietic and plasma cells in bone marrow was evaluated under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic conditions, by means of a sequential double immunostaining technique, using monoclonal antibody MIB-1 recognizing the cell proliferation-associated nuclear antigen Ki-67, and antibodies against glycophorin-C, myeloperoxidase, factor VIII-related antigen, and immunoglobulin light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight B5 fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies were analysed, including 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>10 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, 14 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, and 15 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrows, the highest proliferative activity was noticed in the erythroid cells (75% to 95%; mean 90%), in comparison with myeloid precursors (15% to 80%; mean 38%), and megakaryocytes (10% to 20%; mean 14%): no Ki-67 positive plasma cells were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e>, the expression of MIB-1 by erythroid cells was similar to that observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the percentage of MIB-1 + myeloid precursors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> largely overlapped the values observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, and comparable values were also found in the blast cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> type M1 and M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the evaluation of either erythroid or myeloid proliferative activity is of little value in the differential diagnosis between these <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the obvious increase of Ki-67 expression of megakaryocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, with labelling also of micro-megakaryocytes, might sustain the diagnosis in controversial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since cases of mature <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> showed less than 2% of Ki-67 positive cells, evaluation of proliferative activity is of no value in the differential diagnosis with reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequential double immunophenotyping for Ki-67 antigen and for haematopoietic cell lineage-associated markers can be applied in a consistent manner to routine bone marrow biopsies to evaluate proliferating cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic conditions </plain></SENT>
