<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors like azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> are known to be effective in the clinic for diseases like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> that may result in part from transcriptional dysregulation due to epigenetic changes, there is interest in developing novel DNMT inhibitors that would be more effective and less toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of one such agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi>, which inhibits DNMT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase, were assessed in two human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 and MCF-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">Zebularine</z:chebi> treatment inhibited cell growth in a dose and time dependent manner with an IC-50 of approximately 100 microM and 150 microM in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively, on 96 h exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased expression of p21, decreased expression of cyclin-D, and induction of S-phase arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At high doses <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> induced changes in apoptotic proteins in a cell line specific manner manifested by alteration in caspase-3, Bax, Bcl2 and PARP cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Like other DNMT inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> decreased expression of DNMTs post-transcriptionally as well as expression of other epigenetic regulators like <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> CpG binding proteins and global <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> H3 and H4 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its capacity to reexpress epigenetically silenced genes in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells at low doses was confirmed by its ability to induce expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in association with changes suggestive of active chromatin at the ER promoter as evidenced by ChIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, its effect in combination with other DNMT or HDAC inhibitors like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> or vorinostat was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of 50 muM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> or vorinostat significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 cells compared with either drug alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi> is an effective DNMT inhibitor and demethylating agent in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and potentiates the effects of other epigenetic therapeutics like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and vorinostat </plain></SENT>
