<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dic(1q;7p) was observed in 10 cases, a dic(5p;17q) was observed in six cases, whereas various isodicentric chromosomes were observed in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluding these six cases with isodicentrics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 patients with dicentric chromosomes had involvement of at least one of the chromosome arms 1q, 5p, or 7p resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> for 5q or 7q, and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for 1q </plain></SENT>
