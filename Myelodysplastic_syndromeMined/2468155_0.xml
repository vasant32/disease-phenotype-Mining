<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three main therapeutic alternatives offered to the physician in elderly patients are: (1) initial therapeutic abstention followed by palliative chemotherapy habitually using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> when control of hyperleukocytosis is required; (2) intensive chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (araC) based regimens, which induces complete remission in 45 to 50 per cent of the cases at the price of an initial toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of approximately 30 per cent, with 5 to 15 per cent of the patients possibly being cured, and (3) low-dose araC inducing complete remission, generally of shorter duration, in 25 to 30 per cent of the patients with about 10 per cent toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of randomized trial comparing these approaches, there are no objective criteria enabling precise therapeutic indications to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor initial general condition and a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> are widely accepted factors of poor prognosis whatever the therapeutic strategy used </plain></SENT>
