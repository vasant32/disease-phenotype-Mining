<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Suppressor of cytokine signaling genes (SOCS) are regarded as pivotal negative feedback regulators of cytokine signals, including the interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and interleukin families, released by T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A detailed understanding of the involvement of SOCS genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) is critical to effectively manage GVHD, yet their expression patterns among recipients remain largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD), in a severity-dependent manner, after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 71 recipients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (N=40), ALL (N=12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; N=10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; N=2), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA; N=5), or others (N=2), who received allogeneic HSCT from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings or unrelated donors between 2009 and 2011, were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the expression levels of SOCS1 decreased in recipients with grade II to IV aGVHD and cGVHD when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and non-GVHD recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expressions of SOCS1 decreased significantly more in cGVHD than in aGVHD recipients (P=0.0091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SOCS3 expressions were similarly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are differentially expressed in recipients following allogeneic HSCT, suggesting a prognostic correlation between SOCS genes and the development of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result provides a new platform to study GVHD immunobiology and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for GVHD </plain></SENT>
