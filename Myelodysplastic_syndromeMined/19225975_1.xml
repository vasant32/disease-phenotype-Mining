<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that cell-surface-expressed (c)4-1BBL can be expressed on mononuclear blood cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 35), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (n = 5) or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 11) and can be coexpressed on varying proportions of lymphoid or myeloid malignant cells and on dendritic cells differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct correlations between c- and s4-1BBL were not found in the investigated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up to now expression of 4-1BBL has not been described on primary myeloid malignant cells, but only on malignant cells of lymphoid or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> origin or on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With our work we further contribute to the understanding of the potential role of c/s4-1BBL in immune reactions and its influence on the interaction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and immunoreactive cells </plain></SENT>
