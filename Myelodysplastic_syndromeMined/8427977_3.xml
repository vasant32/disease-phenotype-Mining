<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The combination of two powerful <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSP), has resulted in a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the additive toxicities from ablative preparative regimens may lead to suboptimal use of this combined immunoprophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of administering MTX/CSP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg/d for 4 days) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/d for 4 days) (BuCy4) in 101 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> categorized into high- and low-risk groups receiving HLA-matched marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of MTX short course (15 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 6, and 11) and intravenous CSP (1.5 mg/kg every 12 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three patients (82.1%) received 100% of MTX calculated dose and 87 (86.1%) achieved a CSP therapeutic level (250 to 600 ng/mL) within a median of 16 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients (72.2%) received optimal immunosuppressive therapy comprising a full MTX course and achieving CSP therapeutic concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimated incidence of grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was 9.2% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 5.5% in patients receiving optimal GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine patients (88.2%) survived &gt; or = 100 days posttransplant and 43 (48.3%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, the majority of which were de novo (31 of 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence of relapse was 28.9% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 14.8% in the low-risk group, with a median follow-up of 24.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-risk features and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were significantly associated with relapse (P = .002 and .036, respectively) in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Projected disease-free survival at 2 years was 52.3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 65.2% in low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was significantly improved in optimally treated patients (P = .03) due to a lower incidence of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and infectious episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, optimal delivery of MTX/CSP in association with BuCy4 resulted in a near complete abrogation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in HLA-matched transplants and a significantly improved disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
