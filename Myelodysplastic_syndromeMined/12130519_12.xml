<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cloning of the PIG-A gene has facilitated the unraveling of the complex pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of current major concern is the mechanism by which a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone expands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many reports have suggested that an immune mechanism operates to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because blood cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenotype are often found in patients with these marrow diseases, one hypothesis is that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone escapes immune attack, producing a survival advantage by immunoselection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we examined the sensitivity of blood cells, with or without PIG-A mutations, to killing by natural killer (NK) cells, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To both peripheral blood and cultured NK cells, PIG-A mutant cells prepared from myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines were less susceptible than their control counterparts (reverted from the mutant cells by transfection with a PIG-A cDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NK activity was completely abolished with concanamycin A and by calcium chelation, indicating that killing was perforin-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in major histocompatibility (MHC) class I expression or sensitivity to either purified perforin or to interleukin-2-activated NK cells between PIG-A mutant and control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these results, we infer that PIG-A mutant cells lack molecules needed for NK activation or to trigger perforin-mediated killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experiments suggest that PIG-A mutations confer a relative survival advantage to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone, contributing to selective expansion of these cells in the setting of marrow injury by cytotoxic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
