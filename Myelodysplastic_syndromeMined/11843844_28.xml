<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and marrow failure, we tested for the presence of glycosylphosphatidyl-anchored protein-deficient (GPI-AP) granulocytes in large cohorts of patients with AA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and pure haemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone was detected in 32% of new AA patients and 18% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In serial studies, this proportion did not change up to 15 years after diagnosis, suggesting that expansion of aberrant cells is an early event (i.e. prior to initial presentation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone, on average 14% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> granulocytes were found on presentation and 37% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> but without cytopenia showed higher percentages of GPI-AP-deficient cells than did those with the AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After immunosuppression, there was no change in the contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone to blood production, arguing against the "immune-escape" theory in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically, a high proportion of GPI-AP-deficient cells correlated with marrow hypercellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GPI-AP-deficient cells were similarly present in patients with and without karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the GPI-AP-deficient clones show quantitative and kinetic differences between classic haemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> with marrow failure, in which the evolution rate is low later in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
