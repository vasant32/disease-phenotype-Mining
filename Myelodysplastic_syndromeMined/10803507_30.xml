<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be attributed to enhanced sensitivity of DS <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells to selected chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a less intensive chemotherapeutic regimen which was specifically designed for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remission induction chemotherapy consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (25 mg/m2/day for 2 days), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (100 mg/m2/day for 7 days), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (150 mg/m2/day for 3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received one to seven courses of consolidation therapy of the same regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients were enrolled on the study and their clinical, hematologic and immunophenotypic features were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were younger than 4 years and diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved a complete remission and estimated 8 year event-free survival rate was 80+/-7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients relapsed and two died due to cardiac toxicity and one due to septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study showed that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-DS constitute a unique biologic subgroup and should be treated according to a less intensive protocol designed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-DS </plain></SENT>
