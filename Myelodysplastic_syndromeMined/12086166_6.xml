<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of them had typical RS3PE without underlying disease, and four presented associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patients experienced an excellent response to low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> achieved complete and permanent remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean treatment duration was 18 months and the mean follow-up was 4.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, none of these patients relapsed, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or general health deterioration, and hand and foot radiographs did not show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of them developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panarteritis nodosa</z:e> 6 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four RS3PE patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two were with solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and the other two presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one of them RS3PE preceded the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of RS3PE in the other patients was subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The first patients presented clinical characteristics suggestive of paraneoplastic RS3PE, and they had a poor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, and the rest of them had a complete response to surgical resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> or to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In general, idiopathic RS3PE patients do not show either general health deterioration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and they do respond to low doses of steroids (10 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We observed strong contrasts with the results obtained when treating RS3PE patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with RS3PE the presence of systemic symptoms along with resistance to low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy should alert the physician to the possible presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
