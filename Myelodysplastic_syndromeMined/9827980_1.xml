<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airways obstruction</z:e> (AO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, radiographic investigations showed no serious abnormalities in the early phase and open lung biopsy revealed only mild lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> consistent with pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial PFTs were the best predictor of the clinical course in contrast to radiographic and histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that PFTs should be performed repeatedly in pediatric patients after allogeneic SCT with the aim of diagnosing GVHD-associated AO in the subclinical phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progressive post-transplant AO necessitates prompt initiation of intensive immunosuppressive therapy in order to stop the underlying immunopathologic process even in the absence of severe radiographic and histologic findings </plain></SENT>
