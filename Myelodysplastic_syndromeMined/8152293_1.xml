<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence the disease has been considered to be an appropriate experimental model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, sequential pathological changes in the development of the disease are introduced in the report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Huge <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was the major gross abnormality, which developed with 100% frequency; neither hepato-renal, nor other thymico-lymphatic involvement was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the progressive increase in splenic weight, extensive proliferation of multi-lineage hemopoiesis was prominent, although no differences were apparent in the cellular proportions of each hematopoietic element compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spleens, either in flow-cytometric analysis using markers for each subset of hematopoietic elements, or in the histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the later phases of the disease, the proliferating cell type tended to shift to a variety of single to oligo-lineage hemopoiesis, but the majority of mice still showed the presence of multi-lineage hemopoiesis; histologically, such hemopoiesis was somewhat dysplastic, but had no apparent nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162679" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemic infiltration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several transplantation-assays essentially supported the low neoplastic potential of proliferating cells even in later phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A long-term observation was made aiming to induce more frequent transition of this <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hemopoiesis</z:mp> into a single-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> by transplantation of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> spleen cells, as well as bone-marrow cells from transgenic mice at an early phase of the disease, into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial resulted in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growths</z:e> in the recipients; not only was myelodysplastic hypercellularity seen, but also, single-lineage hemopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, such as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, histiocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and even myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transition from multi-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> into single lineage hemopoiesis at some frequency is reminiscent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher frequency of transition into lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> may be due partly to the immunoglobulin enhancer used as a promoter unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results that the SV40 large T antigen was expressed in every proliferating cells, there was no apparent increase in multi-CSFs activity; together with the results of the transplantation assays suggest that the hyperproliferation of the cells is directly induced by the expression of SV40 large T antigen in the hemopoietic cells themselves </plain></SENT>
