<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients (17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> cases [RA], 2 RA with excess blasts, and one RA with ringed sideroblasts) with 4 mg/kg per day of CSA for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 patients evaluated, 10 showed hematologic improvement; 8 patients showed an erythroid response, 6 showed a platelet response, and one showed a neutrophil response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients with hematologic improvement continued CSA thereafter, and the progressive response was observed until the latest follow-up (median, 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most toxicities associated with CSA usage were manageable, and no patient had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> up to this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short duration of illness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> determined by bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>-type cells were significantly associated with the platelet response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minority of RA patients who did not possess such predictive variables achieved an isolated erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CSA may be a therapeutic option for patients with RA who do not have adverse prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
