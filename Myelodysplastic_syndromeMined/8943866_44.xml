<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the last decade the frequency of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (t-leuk) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) has been increasingly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past 15 years, we treated 56 patients with t-leuk who had received prior chemotherapy (39%), radiotherapy (11%), or both (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drugs received included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (49%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> such as breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was relatively young (43 years +/- 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and 31 patients had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic abnormalities were found in 91% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was uniformly poor, with an overall median survival of 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 18 patients examined (67%) had a multidrug resistance phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P53 genes of the leukemic cells, as well as the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, were analyzed in 21 patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>P53 mutations were identified in 38% of these patients, a relatively high prevalence compared with other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutations were nongermline and restricted to the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We identified different p53 mutations in the various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> of individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of a mutator phenotype was assessed by PCR analysis of microsatellites in eight loci (one trinucleotide repeat sequence, four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi>, and three mononuclear repeat sequences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability in two to seven loci were found in 15 of 16 (94%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This instability is compatible with a mutator phenotype, which predisposes the patients to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including t-leuk </plain></SENT>
