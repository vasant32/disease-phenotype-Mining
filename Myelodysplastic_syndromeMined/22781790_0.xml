<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 835 donor-recipient pairs of CMDP data from 2005 to 2010 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 typing were performed using SBT, SSOP and SSP methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diseases involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (\%n\% = 288), aculte <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (\%n\% = 227), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) (\%n\% = 187), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (\%n\% = 52), non-hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>(NHL) (\%n\% = 25), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(AA) (\%n\% = 42) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (\%n\% = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 835 donor-recipient pairs, 362 were completely matched, 159 had a mismatch for a single allele, 125 had a mismatch for a single antigen, 95 had mismatched for both single allele and single antigen, 29 were mismatched at double allele, 20 at double antigen, 45 at multiple allele and antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up assessment was completed before March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HLA-matched pairs had higher overall survival (OS) than HLA-mismatched pairs (79.83% vs 73.15%), but there was no statistically significant differences (\%P\% &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA mismatch for a single allele plus a single antigen was a significantly risk factor for OS, disease free survival (DFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OS from high to low in different diseases were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, AA, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, NHL, and ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OS of HLA locus mismatch were DRB1 (94.4%), DQB1 (83.3%), B (75%), A (74.4%) and C (71.4%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OS of single allele mismatch at HLA locus from high to low were DRB1, C, A, B and DQB1.HLA-A, B, C locus mismatch were statistically significantly associated with lower OS and grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD compared with HLA-matched pairs (\%P\% &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*15:01/B*15:05, DRB1*12:01/DRB1*12:02, C*04:01/C*03:04, DQB1*03:02/DQB1*03:03 alleles mismatch were given priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But the donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*39:01/B*39:05, C*15:02/C*14:02, C*08:01/C*03:04, C*07:02/C*15:02 alleles mismatch were risk factors for influence of OS and aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high resolution typing for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 can be identified nonpermissive mismatch, which is beneficial for the selection of a suitable donor improves survival on unrelated donor HSCT </plain></SENT>
