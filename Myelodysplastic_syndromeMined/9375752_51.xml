<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that approximately 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> respond to treatment with human recombinant granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) plus erythropoietin (epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate pre-treatment variables for their ability to predict erythroid responses to this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>98 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (30 RA, 31 RARS, 32 RAEB, five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) were treated with a combination of G-CSF (0.3-3.0 microg/kg/d, s.c.) and epo (60-300 U/kg/d, s.c.) for at least 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Minimum criteria for erythroid response was a 100% reduction of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion need or an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level of &gt; or = 1.5 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>35 patients (36%) showed responses to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medium duration of response was 11-24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, serum erythropoietin levels and initial RBC-transfusion need retained high statistical significance (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using pre-treatment serum epo levels as a ternary variable (&lt; 100, 100-500 or &gt; 500 U/l) and RBC transfusion need as a binary variable (&lt; 2 or &gt; or = 2 units per month), the analysis provided a predictive score for erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This score divided patients into three groups: one group with a high probability of erythroid responses (74%), one intermediate group (23%) and one group with poor responses to treatment (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This predictive scoring system could be used in decisions regarding use of these cytokines for treating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, both for defining patients who should not be given the treatment and for selecting patients for inclusion in prospective trials </plain></SENT>
