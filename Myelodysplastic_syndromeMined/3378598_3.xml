<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the efficacy and toxicity of each combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall rate was 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 50% responded favorably to the combination of IFN, vit D3 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (IDR), which was comparable to the response rate of 43% for low-dose ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the IDR treatment may be explained by additive or synergistic effects between the separate drugs in the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ara-C and IDR treatment was generally well-tolerated but interferon gave more side effects than any other drug used in the study </plain></SENT>
