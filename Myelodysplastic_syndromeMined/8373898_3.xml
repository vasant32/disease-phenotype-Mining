<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the kinetics of erythrocyte turnover revealed a decreased erythrocyte life span of 44 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From these data a prolongation of the reticulocyte maturation time to &gt; 20 days can be concluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's erythrocytes lacked the increase of mean corpuscular volume and a significant increase of erythrocyte enzymes that would be expected in marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>reticulocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the reticulocytes represented not newly formed red blood cells, but "pseudoreticulocytes", i.e., mature erythrocytes that retained their substantia reticulofilamentosa </plain></SENT>
