<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multistep pathogenesis caused by a clonal stem cell defect affecting several differentiation pathways has been proposed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the better characterized alteration of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, defects in thrombocytopoesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remain less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the expression of platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP) Ia/IIa, IIb/IIIa, Ib/IX, and IV in 21 MDS patients (12 RA, 2 RARS, 4 RAEB, 1 RAEB-T, 2 CMML) and healthy controls by flowcytometric analysis and quantitation of platelet GP <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> using fluorescence-based PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a reduced cell surface expression of GPIb (p&lt;0.01) and GPIIb/IIIa (p&lt;0.01), while GPIa/IIa and GPIV expression was only marginally different between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a two-fold increase of platelet GPIb and GPIIb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and a three-fold increase of GPIV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of platelet GPIb and GPIIb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were significantly more prominent among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>(-T)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
