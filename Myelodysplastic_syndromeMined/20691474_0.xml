<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From three large medical centers over a 10-year period, we identified 32 MDS cases where del(11q) was present either as a sole (n=23) or associated with another abnormality (n=9), showing an overall 0.6% frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients included 15 men and 17 women, with a median age of 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three were therapy-related, and 29 were primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases were characterized by transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (65%); frequent ring sideroblasts (RS) (59%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> (22%), and less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 32 months, 9/24 (38%) cases progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and the overall survival (OS) was 35 months (3-105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed MLL deletion in 6/10 cases, but no cryptic MLL translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 MDS cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FISH performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with del(11q) showed MLL rearrangement in 3/17 (18%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, del(11)q occurring in a non-complex karyotype is predominantly associated with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, lack of cryptic MLL rearrangements, and shows characteristic clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These clinicopathological features are likely attributed to commonly deleted regions of 11q and their involved genes </plain></SENT>
