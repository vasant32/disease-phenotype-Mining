<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with intermediate- to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received oral melphalan at a daily dose of 2 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The melphalan therapy was continued until marrow blasts increased or severe cytopenia attributed to melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) were still maintained with melphalan until disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 30 patients, 9 (30.0%) achieved CR, 3 (10.0%) PR, 3 (10.0%) bone marrow complete remission and hematology improvement (MCR + HI), 1 (3.3%) MCR, 4 (13.3%) stable disease and 10 (33.3%) no response, the overall response rate being 66.7% according to the Modified International Working Group Response Criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CR plus PR rate (60.0%) and total response rate (80.0%) in patients with normocellular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> were significantly higher than in those with hypercellular bone marrow (0.0%, 40%, respectively) (P = 0.002 and 0.045, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) and median relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) were 18 (95% CI 14-22) and 11 (95% CI 3-19) months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no side-effect except for slight marrow suppression in 3 patients and one patient died from brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on inefficacy of platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose melphalan therapy for intermediate- to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is safe and effective, especially suitable for elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
