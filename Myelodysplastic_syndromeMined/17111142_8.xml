<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed medical records from three distinct subgroups of del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who had unexpected effects with lenalidomide treatment: 1. two patients with complex karyotypes who achieved both cytogenetic remissions and transfusion independence; 2. two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> who took lenalidomide for less than 12 weeks but remained transfusion independent for 15+ months still displaying del(5q) metaphases after 6 and 12 months; and 3. one patient who was a non-responder on lenalidomide during treatment but became transfusion independent for 13+ months after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but the latter patient in this series had reduction of affected metaphases, suggesting that erythroid responses might be mediated by result from partial or complete suppression of the malignant clone, either directly or indirectly through modulation of the bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These clinical observations illustrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of del(5q)<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis and the diversity of lenalidomide responses within this patient subset </plain></SENT>
