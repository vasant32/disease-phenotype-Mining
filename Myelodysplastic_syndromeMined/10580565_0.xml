<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleoli in erythroblasts were visualized by a simple cytochemical procedure for the demonstration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> which facilitated the visualization not only large nucleoli but also micronucleoli in advanced stages of the erythroblastic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In control patients nucleoli were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of erythroblastic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients suffering from RA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, a relatively large population of polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts was characterized by a loss of nucleoli accompanied by the decreased incidence of micronucleoli characteristic of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to control patients, in patients suffering from RA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the number of nucleoli expressed by the values of the nucleolar coefficient of erythroblasts was smaller, particularly in both the early and terminal stages of erythroblastic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus in patients with RA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> both the abnormal loss of nucleoli and decreased number of nucleoli in erythroblasts apparently represent and reflect a further abnormality of disturbed erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
