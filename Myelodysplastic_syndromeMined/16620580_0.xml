<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By FACS, the quantity and ratio of IFN-gamma producing CD4(+) T cell (Th1) and IL-4 producing CD4(+) T cell (Th2) cells in the bone marrow were detected in 21 MDS patients, 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 13 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes of 18 MDS patients and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the ratio of the blast cells in the bone marrow and the number of the Th1 cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of Th1 cells, Th2 cells and ratio of Th1/Th2 in the bone marrow of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were (0.48 +/- 0.10)%, (0.24 +/- 0.19)% and 2.31 +/- 0.76 respectively, while those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were (0.36 +/- 0.11)%, (0.76 +/- 0.35)% and 0.51 +/- 0.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Th1 cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was reduced and the Th1/Th2 ratio was significantly lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those of the patients with SAA were (4.75 +/- 0.49)%, (0.40 +/- 0.28)% and 26.5 +/- 8.79 respectively, their Th1 cells and Th1/Th2 ratio were markedly higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls the karyotypes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was (50.00 +/- 0.10)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower ratio of the Th1 cells in the bone marrow of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> which progressed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was negatively correlated with the higher percentage of the blast cells (r = -0.563, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The immune function of T lymphocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is abnormal: the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells is broken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) With descending of the number of Th1 cells in the bone marrow of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the disease is progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
