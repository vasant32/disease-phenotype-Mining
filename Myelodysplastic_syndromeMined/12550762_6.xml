<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, next to nothing is known about its pathogenetic importance or its molecular genetic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms involved in the transformation process include dosage effects of genes mapping to chromosome 8 and presence of specific mutations or cryptic fusion genes on the duplicated chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter case, +8 would be secondary to a cryptic primary rearrangement and not involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> as such, but rather in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although hidden genetic changes have been found in some <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp>, for example, mutations in KIT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with +4 and in MET in hereditary papillary kidney <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7, none associated with +8 have so far been discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we have investigated a total of 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 as the sole chromosomal anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were studied by combined binary ratio multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and with FISH using locus-specific probes for both arms of chromosome 8, the subtelomeric regions of 8p and 8q, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated genes FGFR1, MOZ, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>, and MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cryptic changes were detected, thus excluding the possibility of gross genetic rearrangements or aberrations involving these loci on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
