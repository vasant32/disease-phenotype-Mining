<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism that leads to hemopoietic failure in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence, however, that regulatory molecules such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, Fas (CD95), and Fas-ligand, which negatively affect hemopoiesis by way of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed marrow samples from 80 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in regard to TNF-alpha and Fas-ligand levels and a possible correlation with various disease parameters and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha levels were elevated in comparison to samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow donors, however, no significant correlation with FAB subtype, cytogenetic risk group or score by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was an inverse correlation between the cytogenetic risk category (low, intermediate, high) and levels of soluble Fas-ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major source of TNF-alpha were mononuclear (non-stromal) cells which appeared to produce TNF-alpha at maximum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limiting dilution analysis of CD34+ precursor cells showed that individually assayed cells, removed from companion cells that presumably provided negative signals such as TNF-alpha or Fas-ligand, were able to generate progressively increasing numbers of colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stromal layers derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow did not have an inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, higher colony numbers were obtained from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow derived hemopoietic precursors propagated on irradiated stromal layers from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow than on stromal layers from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that substantial numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoietic precursors persist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, differentiation into mature cells is inhibited by negative signals originating from accessory or abnormal hemopoietic precursors in the non-adherent marrow fraction </plain></SENT>
