<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was 6.9 g/dl, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was revealed by bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, and frequent transfusions were needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His renal function rapidly deteriorated in the middle of August (BUN 45 mg/dl, Cr 4.8 mg/dl) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000794'>IgA nephropathy</z:hpo> (IgAN) with marked intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> was disclosed by renal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In November, joint manifestations of warmth and pain, which suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, appeared at the bilateral wrist and ankle joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soon after receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (20 mg/day), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was relieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal function also improved (BUN 41 mg/dl, Cr 21 mg/dl) and frequent transfusions were no longer necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is a case with various clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, IgAN, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and appears to be the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> case complicated with IgAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of case reports have identified immune abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow abnormalities</z:e> have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> could be complicated by IgAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their pathogenetic association is discussed in this paper </plain></SENT>
