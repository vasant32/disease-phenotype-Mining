<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied an alternative method of using hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) to enhance hematopoietic recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT), by short in vitro preincubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> received T-cell-depleted allografts using Campath-1G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of the marrow was infused on the scheduled day of transplant and one third of the marrow following preincubation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) on day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engraftment parameters and duration of hospitalization were compared by actuarial analysis to those of 40 historical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving the incubated boost had significantly faster platelet recovery (P = .017) and shorter hospitalization period (P = .001) when compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet count reached greater than 25 x 10(9)/L on day 17 (median) in the study group and on day 23 in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of hospitalization was 20 and 36 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the early posttransplantation follow-up, two of four patients in the study group died as a result of graft rejection, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the control group resulted from complications associated with marrow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that pretransplant in vitro activation of bone marrow cells with IL-3 and GM-CSF may prove to be an efficient method for enhancing marrow recovery after BMT </plain></SENT>
