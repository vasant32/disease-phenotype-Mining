<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observational, cross-sectional, and multicenter study was conducted from January to May 2007 in 81 Spanish hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had a low or intermediate-1 risk score and had to have received at least ten units of packed red blood cell (PRBC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 549 patients analyzed, 75% had received more than 20 PRBC units since diagnosis; 14% had IO at diagnosis and 58% at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of patients received chelation therapy; of those, 92% were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels at the start of chelation therapy were higher than 1,000 microg/L in 76% and over 2,500 microg/L in 24% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 202 patients who received some form of chelation therapy, ferritin levels increased from a mean +/- SD of 1,986 +/- 1,398 to 2,480 +/- 1,648 microg/L at last follow-up in 86% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 29 patients treated with a minimally effective therapy, ferritin levels did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, only 11 patients received such therapy lasting more than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most low-risk transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients develop IO, but only a minority receives a minimally effective and timely iron chelation therapy </plain></SENT>
