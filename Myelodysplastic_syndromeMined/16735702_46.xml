<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether additional intensification can add to this effect has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,770 patients (age 16 to 85 years) with de novo or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were randomly assigned upfront for induction therapy containing one course with standard dose and one course with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, or two courses with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and in the same step received postremission prolonged maintenance or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete remission rate in patients younger than 60 and &gt; or = 60 years of age was 70% and 53%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall survival at 3 years in the two age groups was 42% and 19%, the relapse-free survival was 40% and 19%, and the ongoing remission duration was 48% and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in these results between the two randomized induction arms or between the two postremission therapy arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in any prognostic subgroup according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, cytogenetics, WBC, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and early blast clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The regimen of one course with standard-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and one course with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> for induction, and prolonged maintenance for postremission chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is not improved by additional escalation in cytotoxic treatment </plain></SENT>
