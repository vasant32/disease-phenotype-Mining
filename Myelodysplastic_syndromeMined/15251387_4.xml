<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 103 patients who received allogeneic stems cell transplants was performed to define the incidence and outcomes of Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (73.8%) and 29 patients (28.2%) nonmyeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up of 9 months, Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were observed in 10 patients (9.7%) at a median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 32 days posttransplant (range 2 to 102 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causative organisms identified in five cases included Staphylococcus species (n = 4) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six events successfully resolved with antibiotic treatment, while the other four required the removal of the Hickman catheter with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival duration for infected patients was shorter than that for the noninfected group (83 days vs 366 days, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myeloid engraftment was delayed in the infected group (18.0 days vs 15.0 days, P = .038) and this complication was more frequently observed among the BMT compared with PBSC group (22.2% vs 5.3%, P = .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hickman <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were associated with transplant-related mortality especially during the first 3 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, the current results emphasize both the importance of Hickman catheter care and the need for surveillance cultures after stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
