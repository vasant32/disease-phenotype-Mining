<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The immunohistochemical detection of CD34 protein using QBEND10 antibody in bone marrow trephine biopsies was shown recently to be a precise method for quantitation of blasts and a possibly useful approach in diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate CD34+ cells in bone marrow biopsies with various diagnoses and to assess how counts obtained using this method correlate with blast counts obtained by traditional morphologic evaluation of bone marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Bone marrow trephine biopsies from 108 adult patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-CD34 antibody (QBEND10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD34+ mononuclear cells were counted and compared with the blast counts in the bone marrow aspirate smears or imprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ mononuclear cell clusters and CD34+ megakaryocytes were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The type of positivity (membranous vs cytoplasmic) and the percentage of CD34+ megakaryocytes were evaluated because the presence of CD34+ megakaryocytes was recently suggested to be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> or nonneoplastic bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 24 biopsies with partial involvement by non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 5 of 60 biopsies with reactive changes had 5% to 10% CD34+ mononuclear cells and were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> and increased hematogones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ mononuclear cell clusters were found only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ megakaryocytes were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of CD34+ mononuclear cells was often slightly higher than the number of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow smears, probably due to increased hematogones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence and the number of CD34+ megakaryocytes do not appear to have diagnostic value, but this finding should be further investigated in relation to clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
