<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both conventional karyotyping and X-inactivation analysis demonstrated the persistence of a monoclonal pattern of hematopoiesis in the two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) treated either with GM-CSF or with IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The partial restoration of non-clonal hematopoiesis was observed in one patient with RA and an excess of blasts following treatment with a combination of GM-CSF and low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a fourth patient with RA and in the patient with ET, treatment with IL-3 resulted in the complete restoration of a non-clonal pattern of peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the bone marrow cells remained monoclonal by Southern blot analysis in the patient with RA in whom it could be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-clonal lymphocytes appear to have been released into the peripheral blood in the two latter cases and are responsible for the non-clonal RFLP pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cytokine therapy may have diverse effects on hematopoiesis, including the release of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells into the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
