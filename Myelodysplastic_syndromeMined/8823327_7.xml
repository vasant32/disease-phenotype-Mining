<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, to determine the pretreatment variables having prognostic significance for treatment outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred seven newly diagnosed patients with no history of cytopenias having a local institutional de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> successfully karyotyped and treated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) protocols for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from 1984 to 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three of the 907 patients were reclassified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on central pathology review using FAB criteria and form the basis of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment outcomes for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were similar; the complete remission (CR) rate was 79% and 68%, respectively (P = .37); median CR duration was 11 and 15 months, respectively (P = .28); and median survival was 13 and 16 months, respectively (P = .72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, there were no prognostic variables for CR rate identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For CR duration, only the Sanz classification had prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors for survival in a univariate analysis included age, WBC count, Sanz classification, and percent blood blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a proportional hazards analysis of survival, age greater than 60 years and WBC less than 2.6 x 10(9)/L were adverse prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with no known history of cytopenias who are treated intensively at diagnosis, the FAB distinctions between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> appear to have little therapeutic relevance </plain></SENT>
