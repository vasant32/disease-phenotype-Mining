<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> (ND) complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cryofibrinogenemia</z:e> (CFGN) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the patient presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were compatible with those of ND from the clinical and histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, immunofluorescence technique revealed cryofibrinogen (CFG) deposits on the walls of the blood vessels in the skin lesion, and a high titer of CFG components was disclosed in the patient's peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, CFGN may have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; hence CFG deposits probably played a role, at least in part, in the skin lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is probably the first case of ND complicated by CFGN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And careful examination of an underlying disease is recommended in association with ND and/or CFGN </plain></SENT>
