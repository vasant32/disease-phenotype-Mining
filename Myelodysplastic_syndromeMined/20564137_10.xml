<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 87 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=67) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=.20) after failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> regimens were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 21 months from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> failure, 13 (15%) patients remained alive; the median survival was 4.3 months, and the estimated 12-month survival rate was 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated 12-month survival rates were 27%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, for patients with high-risk, intermediate-2-risk, and intermediate-1-risk disease (P=.99) by the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated 12-month survival rates were 100%, 54%, 41%, and 18%, respectively, for patients with low-risk, intermediate-1-risk, intermediate-2-risk, and high-risk disease according to The University of Texas M </plain></SENT>
