<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of (131)I-anti-CD45 antibody (Ab; BC8) that can be combined with a standard reduced-intensity conditioning regimen before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients older than 50 years with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with (131)I-BC8 Ab and fludarabine plus 2 Gy total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with greater than 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment produced a complete remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had 100% donor-derived CD3(+) and CD33(+) cells in the blood by day 28 after the transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTD of (131)I-BC8 Ab delivered to liver was estimated to be 24 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (12%) died of nonrelapse causes by day 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated probability of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> at 1 year is 40%, and the 1-year survival estimate is 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that CD45-targeted radiotherapy can be safely combined with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to yield encouraging overall survival for older, high-risk patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00008177 </plain></SENT>
