<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four months later, his symptom has remained and he was admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A white blood cell decrease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were observed by the blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He underwent echocardiography and 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy (99mTc-Tf) at rest, which showed no abnormal cardiac imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But 99mTc-Tf whole-body planar imaging showed extremely increased bone marrow uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>99mTc-HMDP bone scintigraphy also showed abnormal hot spots in the same skeletal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> like findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi> and 99mTc as tracers for myocardial perfusion imagings were used to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, but increased uptake of these tracers were reported in <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastasis</z:e>, so increased uptake of 99mTc-Tf and 99mTc-HMDP was thought to be caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> flow with ineffective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We report a case that abnormal skeletal uptake of 99mTc-Tf which was caused by ineffective hematopoiesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
