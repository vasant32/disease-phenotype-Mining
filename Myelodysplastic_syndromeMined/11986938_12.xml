<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential contribution of abnormal marrow stromal function to ineffective haemopoiesis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared the ability of stromal layers from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 7) and myelodysplastic (n = 9) marrow to alter proliferation and survival of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-3-dependent cell line F-36P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-cultures for 72 h in the absence of exogenous cytokines were either in direct contact with stroma or separated by transwell inserts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal layers, the ratio of adherent F-36P cells relative to stromal cells increased from a mean of 0.2 +/- 0.01 (s.d.) at 4 h of co-culture to 0.34 +/- 0.08 after 72 h (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding values on myelodysplastic stroma (0.2 +/- 0.02 at 4 h and 0.35 +/- 0.05 at 72 h; n = 9) indicated that the ability of myelodysplastic stromal layers to regulate short-term proliferation of F-36P cells may be similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of F-36P cells was quantified after co-culture with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or myelodysplastic stroma: results from myelodysplastic co-cultures were standardized as a fraction of values from co-cultures with paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stroma (apoptotic ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Augmented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of F-36P cells was detected in 8/9 co-cultures with myelodysplastic stroma (mean = 15.7 +/- 9.7%, n = 9), compared with corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stroma (mean = 12.4 +/- 4.6%, n = 7, P &lt; 0.05) with a mean apoptotic ratio of 1.4 +/- 0.5 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between stroma-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and FAB type, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha concentrations in the culture supernatant or numbers of stromal macrophages, and no evidence of involvement of the Fas pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> was detected in cells grown in transwell inserts over stroma (23.8 +/- 3%, n = 5) compared to adherent cells in cultures with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal layers, but this survival difference was not observed in co-cultures with myelodysplastic stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that abnormal stromal function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of haemopoietic cells within the marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect appears to be dependent on close cellular contact, rather than the release of soluble factors, but the exact mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
