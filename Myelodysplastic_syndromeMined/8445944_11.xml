<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By circumventing the need for metaphase preparations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase nuclei using chromosome-specific probes is a promising tool for the study of numerical chromosome aberrations not only in proliferating, but also in non-dividing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 15 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>-7-associated myeloid disorders with a biotinylated probe to the (peri)centromeric region of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was readily confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases during active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients only a minority of nuclei was monosomic, whereas cytogenetics had shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases to be missing one chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH in one of them was able to identify a small marker chromosome as isolated pericentromeric region of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">Minimal residual disease</z:e> however could not be detected in three remission samples analyzed, as percentages of disomic nuclei were within the range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (96.8% 2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to determine lineage involvement of the monosomic clone, a recent technique combining immunophenotyping and FISH (FICTION) was performed in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was found in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myelomonocytic and erythroid cells (as discriminated by lineage-specific antibodies), in a part of CD34-positive precursor cells, but not in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in this patient is restricted to an early committed progenitor cell capable of erythroid and myelomonocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
