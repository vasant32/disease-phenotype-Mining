<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clonal analysis of FACS-purified primitive hematopoietic stem cells and of their progeny as assessed by the progenitors obtained from long-term cultures requires PCR-based approaches, mainly because of the low number of cells available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a non-radioactive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) assay which allows a simple and quantitative evaluation of the clonality of hematopoietic cells and progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this approach 5' AR primer is labelled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> and the amplified product is run on a sequencing gel which allows evaluation of the intensity of the fluorescent peaks generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A computer software then analyzes the reduction of the intensity of the peaks on HpaII-digested samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the feasibility of the technique, we analyzed the clonality of leukemic cells from a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> which showed a typical clonal pattern of her leukemic DNA sample (WBC = 300 x 10(9)/I) using phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same sample was then analyzed with either radioactive- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labelled AR primers, showing a typical clonal pattern (complete disappearance of one allele after HpaII digestion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A short-term clonogenic assay was then set up on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> and clonogenic progenitors were individually analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 24 colonies tested showed a typical clonal pattern with the disappearance of the same allele on each sample after HpaII digestion, indicating that they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> derived from the same leukemic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this approach we then analyzed 94 patients with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and quantification of their fluorescent peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four percent of the patients were clearly heterozygous (ie, a difference of &gt; or = 2 CAG repeats was present between the two copies of the gene) and could be analyzed in an automatic sequencer using the fluorescent primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) showed a clonal or oligoclonal pattern at diagnosis whereas a polyclonal pattern was seen when remission was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, out of 21 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a clonal pattern was demonstrated in 10 whereas an oligoclonal or non-clonal pattern was shown in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results show that this non-radioactive and safe technology can now be used on a large scale to evaluate the clonality of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells and their progenitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> and this might allow new insights into the targets of clonal amplification </plain></SENT>
