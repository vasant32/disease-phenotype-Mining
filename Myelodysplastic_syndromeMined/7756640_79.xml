<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is the current treatment of choice for patients who do not have histocompatible sibling donors or who are otherwise inegligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 50% of patients respond to an initial course of ATG, and many nonresponders can be salvaged by subsequent treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether simultaneous administration of these agents could further improve response rates, we enrolled 55 patients in a therapeutic trial of 4 days of ATG and 6 months of CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 51 patients who had not received previous courses of ATG or CsA, 67% had responded by 3 months, and 78% had responded by 1 year (response was defined as an increase in peripheral blood counts sufficient that a patient no longer met the criteria for severe disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a high incidence of relapse (36% actuarial risk at 2 years), but most relapsed patients responded to additional courses of immunosuppression, and relapse was not associated with a significant survival disadvantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was rare (1 of 51 patients), but the later appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> was more common (5 of 51 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 86% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data support the use of a combination immunosuppressive regimen containing both ATG and CsA as first-line therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
