<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that it is not the FAB classification per se, but the biological behaviour of the blasts as shown by their rate of accumulation that influences the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TLD) as it represents one extreme of the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the results of intensive chemotherapy in 22 patients (median age 60 years; range 26-77 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (14) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>/TLD (8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was analysed by age, interval from diagnosis to treatment, the number of cytopenias, bone marrow blasts and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were also divided according to the rate of disease progression, shown by the time from diagnosis to treatment (group A = &lt; 3 months; group B = &gt; 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 87%; 13 (60%) complete responses (CR) and 6 (27%) partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of disease progression was identified as the most significant predictive factor of achieving CR (p = 0.003) (group A 10/12; group B 3/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with more than 20% blasts also had a better response (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined response rates, however, did not differ significantly between the two groups (group A 92%; group B 80%) as 50% of group B achieved a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The failure to normalize blood counts was not related to the number of cytopenias before starting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, PR was associated with persistence of dysplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CR was associated with complete morphological and cytogenetic response except in two patients in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> re-emerged in patients who achieved CR and of these, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one acquired a new cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients in group B who achieved CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> needed two courses compared with a mean of 1.1 for the other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median survival from treatment for both groups was 10 months, however, no patient in group B survived more than 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In comparison 33% in group A were alive at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The rate of accumulation of blasts predicts the response to chemotherapy and the quality of remissions achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with rapidly increasing blasts can achieve complete morphological and cytogenetic remissions, although they eventually have a dysplastic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intensive chemotherapy for patients with a slow accumulation of blasts may reduce the blast population but with much less benefit on haemopoiesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
