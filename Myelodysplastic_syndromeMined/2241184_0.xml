<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty three patients were given 0.5 mg of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> topically three times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourty five cases were evaluable (Tablet; 85, Troche; 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) Symptoms and signs were improved in 102/144 (70.8%) and 102/145 (70.3%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 70.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) The improvement rates were 77.5% (55/71), 85.7% (6/7) and 62.7% (32/51) in leukocyte count-increased, -unchanged and -decreased patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3) No background factor of the patients except performance status affected the improvement rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) Higher improvement rate was noted in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> early starting group (within 5 days after the appearance of oral lesions) than the late group (6 days and thereafter) (76.5% v.s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>55.8%: U-test p less than 0.1, chi2-test p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5) There was no difference in the efficacy rate between the tablet and the troche </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>6) Mild side effects were seen in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that topical administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> is safe and useful for improving chemotherapy-associated oral mucosal lesions of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
