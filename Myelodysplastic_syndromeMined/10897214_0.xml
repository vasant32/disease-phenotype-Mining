<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, a positive response to M-CSF (stimulation index &gt; or = 2.5) was seen in 27.3% of the cases, and a significantly higher response rate (81.8%) was seen following G-CSF treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, M-CSF showed a higher stimulating index than that observed for non-monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was administered in 19 cases and M-CSF in 5 cases after chemotherapy, and none of the patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell proliferation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between in vitro test results and clinical response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to the CSFs administered </plain></SENT>
