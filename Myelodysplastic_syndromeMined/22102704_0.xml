<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the molecular characterization of a new t(4;21)(q21;q22) in a de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> that resulted in the deletion of the RUNX1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR an almost complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the expression of the RUNX1 gene in our t(4;21) case compared with CD34(+) cells that was independent of mutation or DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we explored and confirmed the possibility that this abrogation also prevented transactivation of RUNX1 target genes, perhaps confirming the genetic origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and the myelodysplastic features observed in our patient, and certainly mimicking what has been observed in the presence of the RUNX1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> fusion protein </plain></SENT>
