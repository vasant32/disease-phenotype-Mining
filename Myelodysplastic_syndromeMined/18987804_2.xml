<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reverse methylation-induced gene repression, DNA hypomethylating agents are currently in clinical trials for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, with two of these now approved for the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and the efficacy of these drugs can be assessed by the monitoring of global DNA methylation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we outline a simple, well-established method for the evaluation of genomic DNA methylation levels, based on the ability of isolated DNA to "accept" radiolabeled methyl groups from S-[3H-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>] adenosylmethionine, using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> CpG methyltransferase SssI </plain></SENT>
