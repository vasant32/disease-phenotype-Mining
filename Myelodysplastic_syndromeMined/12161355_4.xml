<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">Amifostine</z:chebi> is a cytoprotective compound that has been shown to protect against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cytotoxicities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a phase I study of dose escalation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and high-dose ara-C in patients with relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The continuous reassessment method was used to predict the probability of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were treated at an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> dose of 18 mg/m2/day x 3, three of whom developed grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> or mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, three additional patients were treated at a dose of 15 mg/m2 x 3 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom experienced grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> or mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient achieved complete remission (CR rate 12.5%, 95% CI 0-0.52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> does not allow dose escalation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> when combined with high-dose ara-C </plain></SENT>
