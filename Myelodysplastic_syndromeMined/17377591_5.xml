<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated 'knock-in' mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that express a NHD13 fusion gene from the endogenous murine NUP98 promoter, and used an in vitro differentiation system to differentiate the ES cells to hematopoietic colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Replating assays demonstrated that the partially differentiated NHD13 ES cells were immortal, and two of these cultures were transferred to liquid culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cell lines are partially differentiated immature hematopoietic cells, as determined by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype and gene expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite these characteristics, they were unable to differentiate when exposed to high concentrations of erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell lines are incompletely transformed, as evidenced by their dependence on interleukin 3 (IL-3), and their failure to initiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> when injected into immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We attempted genetic complementation of the NHD13 gene using IL-3 independence and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice as markers of transformation, and found that BCR-ABL successfully transformed the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that expression of a NHD13 fusion gene impairs hematopoietic differentiation, and that these cell lines present a model system to study the nature of this impaired differentiation </plain></SENT>
