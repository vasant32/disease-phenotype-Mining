<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested 14 patients (age, 23-65 years), 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, who underwent HLA-mismatched HCT and subsequently received donor NK cell infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell donors (age, 16-51 years), comprising seven siblings, five offspring, and two mothers of the patients, underwent growth factor-mobilized leukapheresis for 3-5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells collected on the first 2-4 days were used for HCT, whereas those collected on the last day were CD34 selected by magnetic-activated cell sorting (median, 2.22 x 10(6) cells/kg; range, 0.29-5.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor NK cells were generated from the CD34(+) cells by ex vivo cell culture over a 6-week period (median, 9.28 x 10(6) cells/kg; range, 0.33-24.50; CD122/CD56(+) 64%; CD3(+) 1.0%; and viability 88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity in patients infused with these cells 6-7 weeks post transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, one and five patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD during post transplant period, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results showed that clinical-grade donor NK cell production from CD34(+) cells is feasible </plain></SENT>
