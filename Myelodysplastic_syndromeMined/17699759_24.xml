<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rho GTPase-effector mammalian diaphanous (mDia)-related formins assemble nonbranched actin filaments as part of cellular processes, including cell division, filopodia assembly, and intracellular trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas recent efforts have led to thorough characterization of formins in cytoskeletal remodeling and actin assembly in vitro, little is known about the role of mDia proteins in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To fill this knowledge gap, the Drf1 gene, which encodes the canonical formin mDia1, was targeted by homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon birth, Drf1+/- and Drf1-/- mice were developmentally and morphologically indistinguishable from their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, both Drf1+/- and Drf1-/- developed age-dependent myeloproliferative defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, fibrotic and hypercellular bone marrow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> in both spleen and liver, and the presence of immature myeloid progenitor cells with high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cell surface markers showed an age-dependent increase in the percentage of CD11b+-activated and CD14+-activated monocytes/macrophages in both spleen and bone marrow in Drf1+/- and Drf1-/- animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the erythroid compartment showed a significant increase in the proportion of splenic cells in S phase and an expansion of erythroid precursors (TER-119+ and CD71+) in Drf1-targeted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, knocking out mDia1 expression in mice leads to a phenotype similar to human myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that defective DRF1 expression or mDia1 function may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> and point to mDia1 as an attractive therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MPS </plain></SENT>
