<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/BACKGROUND: The advent of new treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> has led to the need for a correlation between cytogenetic and morphological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to achieve this by the application of interphase cytogenetics to marrow trephine sections, a technique not previously reported for formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dual colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to detect numerical and structural abnormalities in routinely processed paraffin wax embedded trephine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cases with t(8;21) and three with t(15;17) were analysed, together with a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome specific probes were hybridised with sections and disclosed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> and rhodamine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51247">Texas red</z:chebi> labelled antidigoxigenin and antibiotin amplification; translocations were identified by colocalisation of probes using a double wavelength bypass filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A translocation signal was present in 12% and 11.5% of the cells counted in the t(8;21) and t(15;17) cases, respectively, but in none of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, 9% of the cells counted contained three hybridisation signals for chromosome 8, whereas no cell contained more than two in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This technique is useful for archived routinely processed material, enabling it to be used as a research tool but also, and perhaps more importantly, in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
