<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association of HLA antigens with incidence of organ-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) after allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from an HLA-matched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of allo-HSCT recipients and found 389 patients who had received matched-sibling HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA types, GVHD grades, and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, factors that reflect a certain immunological impact associated with involved organs, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 24.8% (96 cases) and 21.2% (82 cases), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD with grades II through IV was higher among patients who had HLA-B61 (P = .0153) and HLA-Cw3 (P = .0208) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The donor sex (P = .0040) and the conditioning regimen (P = .0010) were also associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extensive-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD incidence was higher in patients who had HLA-B54 (P = .0159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The donor sex (P = .0406) and the pretransplantation diagnosis (P = .0184) were other factors associated with the development of extensive-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HLA-B35 (P = .0226) and HLA-B54 (P = .0091) were associated with a higher incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> skin GVHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> skin and oral GVHD (in descending order of incidence rates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-B7,27 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> liver GVHD (P = .0476) in addition to other parameters including patient (P = .0246) and donor sex (P = .0019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows that these remarkable HLA antigens may be potent transplantation immune regulators, but there is a need for further evaluation using larger study samples </plain></SENT>
