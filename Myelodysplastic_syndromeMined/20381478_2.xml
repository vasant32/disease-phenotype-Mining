<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced haematotoxicities are immune-mediated and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> is a prominent treatment in acquired aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the potential role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> immunosuppressive therapy for severe <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced haematotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between January 2002 and December 2008, 41 patients with severe <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced haematopoietic disorders from five hospitals were enrolled in the study, 22 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, supportive treatments and/or oral <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32369">undecanoate</z:chebi>, 19 patients were treated with supportive treatments and/or oral <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32369">undecanoate</z:chebi> as the control group, and a 6-month follow-up was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> group, 19 of 22 patients (86.36%) had responded to the treatments completely or partially with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">increased platelets</z:e>, white blood cells and hemoglobulin counts by the fourth week (P=0.005), the sixth week (P=0.001) and the third month post-treatment (P=0.034), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the control group treated by supportive methods, only 5 of 19 patients (26.32%) responded to the treatments partially (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> in conjunction with supportive treatments may be an effective treatment modality for patients with severe <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced haematopoietic disorders, which in turn implies that these haematotoxicities are immune-mediated </plain></SENT>
