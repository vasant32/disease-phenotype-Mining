<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were drawn from patients transplanted between 1991 and 1999 facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who received high-dose Cy/TBI regimens were slightly younger, more likely to receive a mismatched transplant and to have intermediate or advanced disease compared with patients in the BuCy or standard-dose TBI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery was significantly higher in the standard-dose CY/TBI group compared with the high-dose Cy/TBI or BuCy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who received the high-dose Cy/TBI regimen had an increased risk of developing grades III-IV aGVHD when compared with the control group who received BuCy (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OS, disease-free survival (DFS), TRM and relapse were not significantly different between any of the regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BuCy, standard-dose and high-dose Cy/TBI regimens have equivalent efficacy profiles for OS, DFS, TRM and relapse risk in patients undergoing T-replete URD marrow transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
