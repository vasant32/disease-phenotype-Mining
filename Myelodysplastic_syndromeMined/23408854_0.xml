<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-CdR) are currently used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We use the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT116 as a model to address this question and determine that &lt;2% of regions demethylated by 5-Aza-CdR treatment assume an open configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consolidating our findings, we detect nucleosome retention at sites of global DNA methylation loss in DKO1, an HCT116-derived non-tumorigenic cell-line engineered for DNA methyltransferase disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, regions that are open in both HCT116 cells after treatment and in DKO1 cells include promoters belonging to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors and genes under-expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that the chromatin opening induced by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24650">hydroxamic acid</z:chebi> has strikingly distinct targets compared with those of 5-Aza-CdR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the importance of combinatorial therapy in eliciting maximal de-repression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> epigenome </plain></SENT>
