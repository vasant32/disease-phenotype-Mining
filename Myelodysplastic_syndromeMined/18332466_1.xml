<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze outcome, prognostic factors, and toxicities in patients with diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) who received involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) before high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue (ASCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and August 2006, 164 patients with relapsed or refractory DLCL received IFRT at Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (New York, NY) before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFRT was delivered to involved sites measuring more than 5 cm or to sites with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> more than 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was administered in 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily to a total dose of 30 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated, and short- and long-term toxicity was assessed according to National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 60 months (range, 2 to 187 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two- and 5-year progression-free survival was 62% and 53%; 2- and 5-year overall survival was 67% and 58%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients relapsed; only 10 patients relapsed completely within the radiotherapy field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were seven early treatment-related mortalities and 11 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (including four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>), one of which occurred within the IFRT site and five after total-body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Minimal treatment-related mortality and morbidity resulted from short, intensive, involved-field radiotherapy before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR, which was incorporated into a salvage regimen for patients with relapsed/refractory DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This chemoradiotherapy salvage regimen resulted in a low local relapse rate that could potentially translate into an improved total outcome </plain></SENT>
