<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunosuppressive activity of humanized anti-Tac were evaluated in 20 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) after allogeneic marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at 5 to 26 (median, 14) days after transplantation and had failed to respond to primary therapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential groups of 4 patients each received a single 1-hour infusion of antibody in escalating doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg; 8 additional patients were then treated with 1.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second infusion of antibody was administered after 11 to 48 (median, 16) days in 8 patients who had transient improvement of GVHD after the first infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> side effects, limited to chills in 1 patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001064'>diaphoresis</z:hpo> in another, were observed during or shortly after the antibody infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 8 patients, 6 of whom were treated with a single antibody infusion and 2 with two infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four responses were complete and 4 were partial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three additional patients had improvement in one organ but progression in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses occurred in 9 of 16 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e>, 3 of 15 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, and 6 of 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients survive at 529 and 645 days after antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died after relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or organ failure between 5 and 211 (median, 55) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The terminal elimination half-life of the antibody was 44 to 363 hours, with a harmonic mean of 79, 88, and 94 hours, respectively, for the three doses studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Absolute peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts remained unchanged during the 56 days after infusion of the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A fraction of circulating T cells expressed the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor that, in some patients, was bound by antibody in vivo up to 28 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No patient developed a measurable antibody response to humanized anti-Tac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Humanized anti-Tac has a long half-life after intravenous injection in humans, superior to any rodent monoclonal antibody specific for human T cells, and does not appear to induce antibody formation in recipients of marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Improvement of steroid-refractory GVHD in 40% of patients after only one or two antibody infusions indicates that humanized anti-Tac is immunosuppressive </plain></SENT>
