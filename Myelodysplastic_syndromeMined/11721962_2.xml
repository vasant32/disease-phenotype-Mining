<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Existing methods for myeloblast enrichment have various prerequisites that limit their application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this new method, a mixture of peripheral blood (Mixed PB) from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patient and from a healthy control containing 5% myeloblasts was subjected to density gradient centrifugation using a 14.5% metrizamide solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both high purity (86.3% +/- 1.5%) and high recovery of viable myeloblasts were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Close to 100-fold blast enrichment, even from Mixed PB containing only 0.15% myeloblasts, was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, this method highly enriched myeloblasts from unprocessed samples, including marrow cells, from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (purity: 2.7% +/- 2.0% before separation, 56.6% +/- 28.3% after separation) (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enriched blasts were suitable for various analyses, eg, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and gene analysis </plain></SENT>
