<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study of phenotypic and molecular alterations in highly fractionated stem and progenitor populations in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed an expansion of the phenotypically primitive long-term <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> (lineage(-)/CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD90(+)) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which was most pronounced in higher-risk cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of progenitors revealed that lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is characterized by expansion of phenotypic common myeloid progenitors, whereas higher-risk cases revealed expansion of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide analysis of sorted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> revealed widespread methylomic and transcriptomic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STAT3 was an aberrantly hypomethylated and overexpressed target that was validated in an independent cohort and found to be functionally relevant in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis demonstrated that a very high percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> (92% Â± 4%) carry cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal analysis in a patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> revealed that karyotypically abnormal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> persist even during complete morphologic remission and that expansion of clonotypic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> precedes clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that stem and progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are characterized by stage-specific expansions and contain epigenetic and genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
