<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on its ability to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL, as well as the c-kit and the Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinases, the spectrum of diseases that may respond to STI571 is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recently recognized subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e>) has a t(5;12)(q33;p13) with the activation of the gene for PDGFBR which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the case of a patient, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, carrying a translocation t(5;12)(q33;p13) who achieved a complete remission following treatment with STI571, 400 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of writing he still remains in complete remission with an excellent performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is clearly a need for further studies of STI 571in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MPD/MDS</z:e> with chromosomal translocations involving PDGFBR to confirm this promising initial result </plain></SENT>
