<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed conventional cytogenetic (CC) and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with an alpha satellite chromosome 7 specific DNA centromeric probe (p alpha 7t1) on bone marrow material prepared for CC in 11 controls and 80 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In controls, a mean of 4.3 +/- 1% of the 700 cells examined showed only one FISH signal for chromosome 7, and the finding of &gt; 6.3% (mean +2 standard deviations) of cells with one FISH signal was considered to indicate the presence of a clone with -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By CC, clonal -7 was found in 11 patients, whereas two patients had -7 in only one mitose (non-clonal -7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight of the 11 cases of clonal -7 by CC, interphase FISH confirmed -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three patients, 5.1%, 6.3% and 18.4% respectively of the cells had one signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those three patients had, in addition to -7 by CC, a marker chromosome which was shown to be constituted of chromosome 7 pericentromeric material by FISH analysis on metaphase spreads (metaphase FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the two patients with non-clonal -7 by CC, one had a -7 clone by interphase FISH whereas the other patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of the 67 patients with no -7 mitose by CC had clonal -7 by interphase FISH, with one chromosome 7 signal in 14.4 to 39% of the cells examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At least three mitoses with -7 were found in two of them by metaphase FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of the five patients were reexamined 12 to 17 months later: CC and metaphase FISH found no -7, whereas interphase FISH still showed a -7 clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients with clonal -7 by CC and by FISH were reexamined in complete hematological remission after intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CC found no -7 and interphase FISH was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that interphase FISH may improve the detection of -7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics should still be performed in parallel to FISH, however, because of possible false negative FISH results when a pericentromeric chromosome 7 marker is present in patients with -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Larger numbers of cases with minor -7 clones, detectable by FISH only, and longer follow-up in those cases will be necessary to determine the significance of this finding, the evolution of this minor clone, and the outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
