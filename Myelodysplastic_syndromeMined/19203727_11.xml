<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the incidence of and risk factors for GVHD over time in children receiving URD BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed outcomes of 638 myeloablative URD BMTs performed between 1990 and 2003 to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recipients were under age 18 years and had available high-resolution HLA typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 27% of the recipients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) grade III-IV; the risk was significantly higher in children receiving T cell-replete grafts compared with those receiving T cell-depleted grafts (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.02 to 4.83; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD significantly reduced the risk of relapse in children with ALL (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.86; P = .0052), but not in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.22 to 2.98; P = .26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of aGVHD was higher in children undergoing transplantation in 1990-1998 (n = 365) compared with those doing so in 1999-2003 (OR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.27 to 2.91; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that outcomes have changed significantly over time, with a reduced risk of aGVHD associated with the more recent transplantations </plain></SENT>
