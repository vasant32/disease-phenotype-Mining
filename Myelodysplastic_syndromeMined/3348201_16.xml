<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most important individual variables, isolated in a previous univariate analysis, were placed in a multiple regression modeling procedure to identify major significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis tends to identify prognostic variables containing significant independent predictive information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristics were examined on both continuous and binary bases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FAB classification was the first parameter entered in regression equations on both models, followed by platelet count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, and circulating erythroblasts in the binary model, and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, systemic symptoms, platelet count, age, and dyserythropoiesis in the continuous model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis confirms FAB classification as the main prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, supports the previously noted predictive value of platelet count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, and age, and recognises the importance of circulating erythroblasts, systemic symptoms, and dyserythropoiesis as prognostic characteristics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
