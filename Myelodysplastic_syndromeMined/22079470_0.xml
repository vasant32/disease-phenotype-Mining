<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were accrued to the phase I portion, which utilized an accelerated titration design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) × 5, melphalan 140 mg/m(2) × 1, and alemtuzumab 20 mg × 5 was adopted for the phase II study, which accrued 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, 27 with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and nine patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The largest subgroup of 35 patients had American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation high-risk, active disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 26% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-89) at 100 days and 59% (95% CI, 47-71) at 1 year </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-5 renal toxicity was observed in 16 of 74 patients (21%) treated at the phase II doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clofarabine-melphalan-alemtuzumab conditioning yields promising response and duration of response, but renal toxicity poses a considerable risk particularly in older patients </plain></SENT>
