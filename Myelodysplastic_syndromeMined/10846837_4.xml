<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since the actions of health insurance systems and overall cultural aspects are strongly associated with QOL, investigations into QOL should be carried out within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have investigated the QOL of adult patients following stem cell transplantation at 31 hospitals in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survivors, who were surveyed by mail questionnaire, were 20 years or older at the time of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age at the time of the study was 36 years, and median interval after transplantation was 35.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 383 patients surveyed, 282 (73.6%) responded to the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-two patients were treated with an allogeneic-related transplantation, 52 with allogeneic-unrelated, and 38 with an autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that the length of time since transplantation and the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were associated with QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When unrelated and related transplantation recipients were compared, ratings on relief from pain, stability in weight, and confidence in dealing with daily life were lower among unrelated transplantation patients </plain></SENT>
