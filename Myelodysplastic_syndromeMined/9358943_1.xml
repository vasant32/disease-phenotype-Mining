<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid--demonstrating predominantly neutrophils and lymphocytes, and, occasionally blast cells as well as plasma cells--indicated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infiltration</z:e> was related to the myelodysplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As no other causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infiltration</z:e> could be found, it seems that a pulmonary infiltrate can be the presenting symptom of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although pleuropulmonary infiltrates most often are caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, these cases illustrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> related infiltrates should also be considered </plain></SENT>
