<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 5 patients (3M, 2F, age 48-64 years) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> ranging from 1.8 to 25 years (median 4.2 years) post-solid organ transplantation, only 2 patients had received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in heart and lung transplant recipients at 15 years was 0.5% and 1.8%, respectively, which is markedly higher compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-risk types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> predominated, 3 of 5 patients are alive (median 3.9 years) since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletions of chromosome 20q, which have not been previously reported in post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, were identified in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings expand the morphologic and cytogenetic spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occurring post-solid organ transplantation and suggest that mechanisms beside <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> toxicity might be important in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
