<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment-related toxicity and, in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) and those who have transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (tAML), post-transplant relapse continues to be problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed results in 128 patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and tAML transplanted from HLA-identical related or unrelated donors after preparation with myeloablative conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight patients were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu), prescribed dose 16 mg/kg, adjusted to achieve plasma concentrations of 800-900 ng/ml, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy), 2 x 60 mg/kg [tBuCy], and 50 patients were conditioned with Bu 7 mg/kg (without dose adjustment) and total body irradiation (TBI) 6 x 200 cGy given over 3 days [BuTBI] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in regards to overall survival, relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>), or non-relapse mortality (NRM) between the 2 regimens regardless of donor status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a trend towards higher rates of relapse (HR 1.33, P=0.38) and lower rates of NRM (HR 0.61, P=0.09) in patients conditioned with tBuCy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased rate of relapse seen with tBuCy was significant when restricted to only those patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (HR 4.50, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients given BuTBI had a higher incidence of GvHD; however, the incidence of GvHD regardless of grade did not differ significantly between patients who relapsed and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/tAML, the use of a less toxic conditioning regimen resulted in a non-significant overall gain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> largely due to lower rates of NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New concepts of conditioning regimens are needed which reduce toxicity without increasing the risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
