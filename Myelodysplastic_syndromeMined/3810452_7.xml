<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in recent years, functional isolation of the lateral ventricle has been seen with increasing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 1979, eight patients without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> have required treatment for an isolated lateral ventricle following insertion of a contralateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients developed their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> after <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, and in six patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We specifically excluded patients in whom isolation of the lateral ventricle was secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302598" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventriculitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We feel that the isolated lateral ventricle following ventriculoperitoneal shunting may be due to a dynamic situation where overdrainage of the shunted ventricle leads to a functional obliteration of the foramen of Monro and subsequent enlargement of the contralateral lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
