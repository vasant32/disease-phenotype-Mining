<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> received either a combination therapy consisting in study 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or in study 2 of a combination with ATRA, G-CSF, erythropoietin (Epo) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ANC increased in 19/20 patients in both studies, whereas an increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, platelet counts or reduction of transfusion requirement was seen in only 8/20 patients, correlating strongly with good BFU-E growth (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of accessory cells in the modulation of the haemopoietic response to treatment, we analysed the capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to secrete cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secretion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytokines was significantly reduced before therapy when compared with healthy controls, but increased during therapy, reaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels for IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a combination therapy with ATRA and cytokines improves impaired cytokine secretion from monocytes and induces a multilineage clinical response in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients characterized by an almost intact erythroid compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, induction of TNF alpha might be responsible for treatment failure </plain></SENT>
