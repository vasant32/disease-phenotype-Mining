<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effects of thalidomide on gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene expression and the involved signaling pathway using an ex vivo culture system of primary human CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that thalidomide induced gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were increased by treatment with thalidomide for 48 hours (from day 3 to day 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that thalidomide activated the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in a time- and dose-dependent manner and increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cells with the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme catalase and the intracellular <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> scavenger dimethylthiourea (DMTU) abrogated the thalidomide-induced p38 MAPK activation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pretreatment with catalase and DMTU diminished thalidomide-induced gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that thalidomide induces increased expression of the gamma-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene via ROS-dependent activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 acetylation </plain></SENT>
