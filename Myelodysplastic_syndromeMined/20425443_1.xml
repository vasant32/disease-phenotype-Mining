<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten years ago, several investigators described improvement in the cytopenia of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> following immunosuppressive treatments (IST) with antithymocyte globulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings have since been widely confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The consensus is that about 30% of unselected transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> given IST have sustained hematologic responses and can regain transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, prognostic features have been defined that accurately identify the subset of patients most likely to benefit from IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we are beginning to define the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> and schedules with the greatest chance of causing hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, long-term follow-up indicates that IST responders have a better progression-free survival than comparable patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who do not receive IST </plain></SENT>
