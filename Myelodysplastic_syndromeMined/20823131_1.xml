<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the factors influencing the response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, we enrolled 127 low/int-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients at diagnosis in a biological study of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 54 non-responders had a significantly lower number of burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-erythroid than responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin-dependent proliferation and survival, and phospho (p)-ERK1/2 expression in steady state and after erythropoietin stimulation were defective in cultured erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By flow cytometry, p-ERK1/2 was significantly lower in bone marrow CD45(-)/CD71(+)/GPA(-)cells from non-responders compared to responders or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis showed that this flow cytometry test was a sensitive biomarker for predicting the response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents </plain></SENT>
