<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a quick analysis of karyotypes with highly complex chromosomal changes was hampered by the problem that up to 24 MCB experiments were necessary for a comprehensive karyotype description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To overcome that limitation the 138 available region-specific microdissection-derived libraries for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human chromosomes were combined to one single probe set, called multitude MCB (mMCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A typical fluorescence banding pattern along the human karyotype is produced, which can be evaluated either by transforming these profiles into chromosome region-specific pseudo-colors or more reliably by studying the fluorescence profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mMCB probe set has been applied on chromosomes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male and female probands, two primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a cell line of Gorilla gorilla (GGO) studied previously by single chromosome-specific MCB was reevaluated by the mMCB method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were in concordance with those obtained in parallel or by other cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic approaches indicating that mMCB is a powerful multicolor FISH banding tool for fast characterization of complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
