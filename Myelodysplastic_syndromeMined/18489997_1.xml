<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However in RIC the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> (GvHD) is high and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive diseases</z:e> tend to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following myeloablative conditioning, patients with chemotherapy-responsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> underwent transplantation from HLA identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GvHD prophylaxis was by ex viva T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with alemtuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these patients was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At transplantation, the median age of 81 consecutive individuals was 45 years (range 15-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GvHD was seen in 10% and was commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> resulting in one and 3 year TRM of 15 and 20.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients relapsed, 10 who had myeloproliferative syndromes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> responded to DLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the whole group, median follow up is 777 (range 7-2702) days and 73% remain disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis for survival showed that only occurrence of GvHD was a significant adverse factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age order than median was not associated with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By reducing the incidence and severity of GvHD, T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of grafts leads to greater tolerance to myeloablative chemotherapy, resulting in acceptable TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This strategy should be compared with the RIC approaches </plain></SENT>
