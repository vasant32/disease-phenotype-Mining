<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic alterations may serve as markers of disease, and may potentially be used for classification, prognostication and to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we now have the capability to pharmaceutically target epigenetic modifications, and there is an urgent need for early validation of the efficacy of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, an improved understanding of the functionality of epigenetic modifications may further pave the road towards individualized therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics provide a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of novel tools for characterizing the epigenome in clinical samples, but at this point the practical, clinical utility of these methodologies needs further exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide the pros and cons of the currently most feasible methods used for characterizing the methylome in clinical samples, and give a brief introduction to novel approaches to sequencing that may revolutionize our abilities to characterize the genomes and epigenomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
