<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients (one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> for 3 to 7 years developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total cumulative doses of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> varied from 89-260 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An antecedent prolonged pancytopenic phase suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with trilineage myelodysplastic features in residual marrow cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q-) in one case and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7) in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were chromosomal aberrations typically associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi>- or therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome-7-specific DNA probe was used to investigate the distribution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 clone in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was demonstrated in both the leukemic blasts and the residual myeloid cells of various stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had evolved from a mutated clone that was capable of terminal differentiation, which was consistent with the biological characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cases represented therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as evidenced by clincopathological features, karyotypic aberrations of 7q-/-7, and demonstration of leukemic evolution from an underlying clonal myeloid disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> might be directly mutagenic </plain></SENT>
