<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Survivin, a new member of the inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (IAP) family, has been reported to be expressed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but not in differentiated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe the identification of a novel alternatively spliced survivin transcript, designated as survivin-3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It comprises 5 exons including novel exon 3B derived from a 165-bp long portion of intron 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acquisition of a new in-frame <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> stop codon within the novel exon 3B results in an open reading frame (ORF) of 363 nucleotides, predicting a truncated 120 amino acid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of survivin-3B was detected in human colon and <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines as well as mononuclear cells prepared from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survivin-3B contains a single baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), which is critical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it lacks a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain, suggesting that survivin-3B may not be associated with G2/M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the function of survivin-3B may be different from that of regular survivin </plain></SENT>
