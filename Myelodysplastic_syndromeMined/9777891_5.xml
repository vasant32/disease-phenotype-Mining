<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to determine factors predictive for non-relapse mortality, relapse, and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 251 MDS patients (median age = 38 years) were transplanted from 1981-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall disease-free survival rate was 40%, with an 18% relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Older age, increasing disease duration, mismatched donors, male gender, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> were factors that significantly enhanced the likelihood of non-relapse mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing disease duration, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and cytogenetics were significant in predicting relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing age, disease <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and cytogenetics were significant in determining disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IPSS score was found to correlate significantly with relapse and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival was 60%, 36%, and 28% for low and intermediate-1 risk, intermediate-2 risk, and high risk patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IPSS score may be used to predict relapse and disease-free survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic transplantation may be recommended for patients with intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
