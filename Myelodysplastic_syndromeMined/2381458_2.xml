<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the deoxythymidine kinase activity in the sera of these patients was higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was also found that the levels of s-dTK in the progressive stage were much higher than those in the indolent stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that high levels of s-dTK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> may reflect the extent of disease and that this activity may be derived from proliferating leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deoxythymidine kinase activity in the extracts derived from cultured cell lines and clinical specimens indicated that leukemic cells contained much higher activity than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
