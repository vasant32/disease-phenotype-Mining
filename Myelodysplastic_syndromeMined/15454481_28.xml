<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of GH therapy on growth, the final heights of 90 GH-deficient children who underwent fractionated TBI and HCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in height standard deviation (SD) from the diagnosis of GH deficiency to the achievement of final height were compared among 42 who did and 48 who did not receive GH therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At HCT, GH-treated patients were younger (P = .001), more likely to have undergone central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system irradiation (P = .007), and shorter (P = .005) than patients who did not receive GH therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After HCT, GH deficiency was diagnosed at 1.5 years (range, 0.8-9.5 years) for GH-treated and 1.2 years (range, 0.9-8.8 years) for nontreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GH therapy was associated with significantly improved final height in children younger than 10 years at HCT (P = .0001), but GH therapy did not impact the growth of older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Girls (P = .0001) and children diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) (compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> [ALL] or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [NHL]; P = .02) also showed more rapid growth than their counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that GH therapy improves the final height of young children after fractionated TBI </plain></SENT>
