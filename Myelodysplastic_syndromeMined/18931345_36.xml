<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (DAC) is approved for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, but resistance to this agent is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In search for mechanisms of resistance, we measured the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of DAC and found it differed 1000-fold among a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) was correlated with the doses of DAC that induced the most hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE; R = 0.94, P &lt; .001), but not with LINE methylation or DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), 3a, and 3b expression at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to DAC showed a low correlation (R = 0.44, P = .11) to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (AZA), but a good correlation to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C; R = 0.89, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5 cell lines most resistant to DAC had a combination of low dCK, hENT1, and 2 transporters, and high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> deaminase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an HL60 clone, resistance to DAC could be rapidly induced by drug exposure and was related to a switch from heterozygous to homozygous mutation of DCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DCK restored DAC sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DAC induced DNA breaks as evidenced by H2AX phosphorylation and increased homologous recombination rates by 7- to 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in vitro resistance to DAC can be explained by insufficient incorporation into DNA </plain></SENT>
