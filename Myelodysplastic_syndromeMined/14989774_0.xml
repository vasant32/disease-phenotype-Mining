<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to observe morphological characteristics and hematopoiesis function of bone marrow megakaryocyte in children patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and analyse the cause and mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD41 McAb immunohistochemical technique was used to detect micromegakaryocytes of bone marrow smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma clot culture and CD41 McAb immunohistochemical technique were used for the MK-colony forming assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colony formations of CFU-MK and BFU-MK were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was no significant difference of CFU-MK colony formation rate between groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But, in 62.5% of children patients the colony formation rate of CFU-MK decreased, in 25% increased, and in 12.5% was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> while BFU-MK formation rate decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of micromegakaryocyte and the positive rate of type I lymphoid micromegakaryocyte were significantly higher than those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there may be two kinds of megakaryocyte clones in bone marrow of children patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One is supposed to be pathologic and potentially malignant micromegakaryocytes, the another may be the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> megakaryocytic precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients induced by increase of pathologic MK leads to abnormal development and maturation of MK in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
