<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), we performed a multiparameter analysis combining conventional chromosome studies (CCS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and bone marrow (BM) culture studies in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> evolving into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mosaicism of a cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clone and a clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 was detected in both patients throughout the course of the disease, a finding confirmed by FISH on BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative size of the trisomic clone increased from 52% to 71% (p &lt; 0.0001) and from 53% to 69% (p = 0.001) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BM cells at the time of the leukemic switch in patients 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined FISH and immunophenotyping of BM cells showed involvement of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 1 and involvement of erythroid cells as well as of the granulomonocytic lineage in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only disomic lymphocytes were detected in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH on single hemopoietic colonies grown in semisolid media detected trisomic CFU-GM and disomic BFU-E in patient 1, whereas a proportion of CFU-GM and BFU-E deriving from the trisomic clone was detected in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the percent of trisomic colonies was lower than the percent of involved granulomonocyte precursors and involved erythroblasts, as detected by combined FISH and immunophenotyping on fresh BM samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have thus shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of lineage involvement by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> undergoing transformation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although preferential growth of disomic clones may occur in vitro, the finding of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of the trisomic clone at the time of leukemic switch suggests that these cells had proliferative advantage in vivo over cells without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
