<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduced effectiveness of the GVL effect in EM sites, as compared with BM, has been suggested to underlie this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the pattern of relapse after haploidentical SCT (haplo-SCT), performed as the first or second SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 38 patients who received haplo-SCT as their first SCT, the cumulative incidences of BM and EM relapse at 3 years were 40.5 and 10.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 19 patients who received haplo-SCT as their second SCT, the cumulative incidences of BM and EM relapse were 30.9 and 31.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most of the patients who underwent repeat haplo-SCT for the treatment of EM relapse had further EM relapse at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-relapse survival did not differ significantly with different patterns of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of EM relapse after haplo-SCT, particularly when performed as a second SCT, suggests that the potent GVL effect elicited by an HLA disparity also occurs preferentially in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the need for a treatment strategy for EM relapse that recognizes the reduced susceptibility of EM relapse to the GVL effect </plain></SENT>
