<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based study to assess the use of HMAs among 4416 MDS patients (ageâ‰¥66 years) who were diagnosed during 2001-2005 and followed up through the end of 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the role of various patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>475 (10.8%) patients had received HMAs by 2007, with the proportion increasing over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who were white (odds ratio (OR)=0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.95), male (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.19-1.82), young (Ptrend&lt;0.01), more recently diagnosed (OR=1.90, 95% CI: 1.54-2.34), had fewer comorbidities (Ptrend&lt;0.01), or had a history of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.00-1.63) were more likely to receive HMAs </plain></SENT>
