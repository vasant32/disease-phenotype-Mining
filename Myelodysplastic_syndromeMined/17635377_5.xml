<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an oral immunomodulatory agent with powerful antitumour <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is licensed for <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based upon reports of thalidomide efficacy, lenalidomide was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in subjects with moderately severe active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study 89 subjects were randomized to lenalidomide 25 mg daily, 5 mg daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were treated for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a 70-point reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall clinical response rate was not significantly different between the three groups: lenalidomide 25 mg 26%, lenalidomide 5 mg 48% and placebo 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide was generally well tolerated with only one serious adverse event, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, being attributed to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide, an oral agent with antitumour <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha properties, was not effective in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in contrast to reports of benefit from thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this lack of efficacy are speculative, other physiological activities may offset its action on inflammatory cytokines, or its antitumour <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha action without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be insufficient for activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
