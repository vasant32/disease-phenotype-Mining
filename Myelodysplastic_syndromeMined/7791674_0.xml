<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> most frequently occur at older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival of these patients, after the diagnosis is made, is mostly short because the disease evolves into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is characterized by appearance of refractive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> with signs of expressed dishematopoiesis of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clear criteria which could define forms with fast or slow course leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> don't exist, so there is a need to group patients into those with good or with bad outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigation included following parameters important for the outlook of the disease: 1. enlargement of lymph nodes, liver and spleen, 2. biochemical examination of peripheral blood, 3. cytomorphologic changes in the peripheral blood cells and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By a follow-up of described parameters a statistically significant influence on survival of the sick concerning the degree of present <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, absolute number of granulocytes, number of thrombocytes, dishematopoiesis of the peripheral blood and bone marrow, lymphadenomegaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of blast in the peripheral blood and bone marrow has a statistically significant influence on patients' short survival </plain></SENT>
