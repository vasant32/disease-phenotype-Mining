<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Registry studies have shown that advanced disease stage at transplantation is associated with inferior overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the optimal timing of allogeneic HSCT, we carried out a decision analysis by studying 660 patients who received best supportive care and 449 subjects who underwent transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment was based on both the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a continuous-time multi-state Markov model to describe the natural history of disease and evaluate the effect of allogeneic HSCT on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This model estimated life expectancy from diagnosis according to treatment policy at different risk stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to supportive care, estimated life expectancy increased when transplantation was delayed from the initial stages until progression to intermediate-1 IPSS-risk or to intermediate WPSS-risk stage, and then decreased for higher risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modeling decision analysis on WPSS versus IPSS allowed better estimation of the optimal timing of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal survival benefits when the procedure is performed before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients progress to advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
