<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of (166)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">Holmium</z:chebi> (Ho)-DOTMP for irradiating malignant cells and adjacent marrow in women with bone-only metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects included 6 women aged &lt; or = 65 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and bone-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of (166)Ho-DOTMP was calculated to deliver a therapeutic absorbed dose of 22 Gy (n = 3) or 28 Gy (n = 3) to the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to circumvent the anticipated myelosuppresion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects showed prompt hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity aside from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> 2 years after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> but was found to have had pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients remained progression free without evidence of disease for more than 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five women experienced disease relapse (4 at extraosseous sites) and died of progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 10.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The approach of bone-targeted radiation therapy with (166)Ho-DOTMP had an acceptable toxicity profile, and sustained complete response was obtained in 2 of 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We are conducting a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of targeted skeletal radiation therapy for treating bone-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
