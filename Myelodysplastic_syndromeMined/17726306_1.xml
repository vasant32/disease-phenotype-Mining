<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, platelet function in these patients has not been thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of our study is to evaluate platelet function in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Platelet function was studied with aggregometry in response to ristocetin, collagen, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> in 26 MDS patients and 15 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aggregation was defective in 21 patients (80.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">Adrenaline</z:chebi> was the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> with the most profound defect (45.9%), followed by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (58.7%), whereas aggregation with ristocetin and collagen was at the borderline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal aggregation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> was detected in 6 patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, aggregation results were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in only 5 patients (19.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation) patients were most seriously affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003540'>impaired platelet aggregation</z:hpo> in response to one or more stimulants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was not statistically different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients at early stages of the disease (&lt;12 months) and those at later stages (&gt;12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003540'>Defective platelet aggregation</z:hpo> is strongly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of our patients was detected to have hyperfunctional platelets, defined as platelets aggregating spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Functional defects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> do not elicit hemorrhagic tendency </plain></SENT>
