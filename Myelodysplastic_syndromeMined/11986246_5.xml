<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both members of the CBF complex are frequently altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) by translocation, most commonly t(8;21), t(12;21), and t(3;21) for CBFalpha, located in 21q22, and inv(16)(p13;q22) for CBFbeta, located on 16q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new mechanism of alteration of CBFalpha, by point mutation, has been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, particularly in M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found no point mutation of the CBFbeta gene in 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 100 AMLs, suggesting a limited role, if any, of CBFbeta point mutations in those disorders </plain></SENT>
