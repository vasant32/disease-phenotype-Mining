<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally we evaluated correlations between these factors and the degree and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients, who suffered from non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) (n = 43), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (n = 11), <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance</z:e> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> (n = 9), were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean neopterin levels were raised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, patients with NHL showing the highest concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ferritin but not neopterin concentrations were higher in males than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between neopterin and ferritin concentrations (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering only female patients the strength of the correlation was the same (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found inverse correlations of neopterin with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and iron concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar relationships existed in patients during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis of an association between the degree of activation of macrophages and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> by a shift or iron towards the storage sites </plain></SENT>
