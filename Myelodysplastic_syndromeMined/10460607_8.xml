<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> of erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages is thought to account for cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (Epo)-induced BFU-E and CFU-E growth was studied in 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) marrow specimens and found to be drastically diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the functionality of Epo-R in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow, we focused on Epo-induced STAT5 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epo was able to stimulate STAT5 DNA binding activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 12/24 MDS marrows tested, with no correlation between the level of STAT5 activation and the development of erythroid colonies in response to Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, impaired proliferation of erythroid progenitors was related to an increased expression of the transmembrane mediator of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> Fas/CD95 on the glycophorin A+ subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore we conclude that the stimulation of pro-apoptotic signals rather than the defect of anti-apoptotic pathways resulting from Epo-stimulated Jak2-STAT5 pathway, predominantly accounts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
