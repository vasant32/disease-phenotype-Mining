<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the data were limited mainly to adult patients, this study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of this procedure in pediatric patients and donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven children aged 2-16 years received allogeneic PBSC transplant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings and the other two were one antigen mismatched family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight donors were younger than 18 years old (10 months to 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Donors were primed with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 10-16 micrograms/kg for 4-5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aphereses were performed on 1 or 2 consecutive days, and the patients received a mean of 14.4 x 10(8)/kg nucleated cells, 6.9 x 10(6)/kg CD34 cells, and 6.9 x 10(8)/kg T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved neutrophil counts of &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l at a median of 16 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients achieved platelet counts of &gt; 20 x 10(9)/l at a median of 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was not observed in the seven patients with follow-up of more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients remained in continuous complete remission after transplant ranged from 2 to 26 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic PBSC transplant appears safe in pediatric patients and donors, and it seems not to be associated with increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
