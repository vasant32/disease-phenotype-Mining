<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rhEPO dosage of 150 U/kg was administered subcutaneously three times weekly for a minimum of 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 27 evaluable patients (26%) had an effective clinical response to therapy by increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations by more than 15 g/l (reaching at least 105 g/l) or by eliminating transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six out of the seven patients responded within four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the responders successfully continued rhEPO treatment 15 months or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether it may be possible to predict response to rhEPO, various clinical parameters were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders were found to be significantly different from non-responders in five aspects: They had less elevated baseline serum EPO levels (92 +/- 33 versus 515 +/- 108 U/l, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>; p = 0.023) and were more often transfusion-independent (71% versus 20% of non-responders; p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, responders were more often females (71% versus 40% in the non-responding group; p = 0.025), of subtype RA rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (four patients and one patient, respectively, compared to seven and nine patients in the non-responding group; p = 0.025), and they predominantly displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes or a 5q- aberration (86% versus 47%; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude, that rhEPO treatment can reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that certain pre-treatment clinical parameters may be used to predict response </plain></SENT>
