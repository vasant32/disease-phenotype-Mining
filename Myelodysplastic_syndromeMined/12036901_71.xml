<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the narrowing of the common deleted region (CDR) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> to the approximately 1.5-megabases interval at 5q32 flanked by D5S413 and the GLRA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Ensembl gene prediction program has been used for the complete genomic annotation of the CDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CDR is gene rich and contains 24 known genes and 16 novel (predicted) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 40 genes in the CDR, 33 are expressed in CD34(+) cells and, therefore, represent candidate genes since they are expressed within the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of the genes assigned to the CDR represent good candidates for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e>, including MEGF1, G3BP, and several of the novel gene predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data now afford a comprehensive mutational/expression analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> candidate genes assigned to the CDR </plain></SENT>
