<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow (BM) cells, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, are risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), the mechanisms of how these cytogenetic abnormalities cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 55-year-old man with a 3-month history of watery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> was admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood examinations revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological analysis and endoscopic images of the entire colon led to the diagnosis of IBD of unclassified type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BM examination showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that his BM cells had dual chromosomal abnormalities: 47, XY, +1, der(1;7)(q10;p10), +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunological studies using peripheral blood monocytes from this patient revealed that the dual chromosomal abnormalities of BM cells led to the development of colitogenic monocytes producing a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and showing resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> upon stimulation with microbial antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An abnormal karyotype of BM cells is not only responsible for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but also for IBD in this case </plain></SENT>
