<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This antibody reactivity, evident by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, was not confined to HTLV core antigens but extended to native and recombinant envelope <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect was also observed in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, albeit to a lesser degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was essentially absent from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and healthy or multitransfused controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No antibodies to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> viruses types 1 or 2 were detected in any of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigated clinical population had no known risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e> other than a history of multiple platelet transfusions, and none of the specimens was seropositive for HTLV-I or HTLV-II according to recommended criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of this cross-reactivity remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
