<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils and bands were also stained for elastase and lactoferrin using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subpopulations of neutrophils and bands from cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> exhibited a qualitative and/or quantitative deficiency in myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a quantitative decrease in elastase and/or lactoferrin staining was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, neutrophils and bands from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have a defect in one or more of the constituents of primary and/or secondary granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These defects are consistent with the view that abnormal neutrophils and bands are derived from a malignant clone of myeloid precursor cells </plain></SENT>
