<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aside from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, no specific clinico-cytogenetic entity has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence and clinical significance of acquired abnormalities of chromosome 17 in adult primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we reviewed the cytogenetic features of 271 patients detected at our institution during a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were identified in 109 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, abnormalities of chromosome 17 were identified in 13 patients (11.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had "single" defects, while in eight patients abnormalities of chromosome 17 were associated with other chromosomal rearrangements ("complex" defects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After chromosomes 5, 7, 8 and 1, abnormalities of chromosome 17 were the most frequent chromosomal rearrangements in our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following "single" defects of chromosome 17 were identified: del(17)(p12) in two cases, and i(17)(q10), del(17)(q21;q23) and del(17)(q12;q22) in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with del(17p), one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and the other one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, had an aggressive course of the disease with accelerated leukemic transformation and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient with i(17q) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> subtype and died soon after diagnosis, while other two cases with interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 17 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> subtype and stable, no progressive course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among "complex" karyotypes with abnormalities of chromosome 17 we identified der(17) in four, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 17 in two, and del(17p) and l(17q) in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and had very short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that abnormalities of chromosome 17 are frequent finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Loss of genetic material in 17p, both in "single" and "complex" defects, seems to be closely related to poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
