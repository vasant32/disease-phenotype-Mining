<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, cell-mediated immunity is often suppressed, being most profound in those with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e>, as demonstrated in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), may, at least in part, be due to altered expression of the CD3-zeta chain, which is an important component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculated that impaired expression of the TCR-zeta chain would be evident in peripheral blood T cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and that such an abnormality would result in an increased ex vivo susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, zeta chain expression was significantly downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the T-cell subsets (P &lt; 0.009) in more than 90% of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significantly lower expression of the CD3-epsilon chain (P &lt; 0.001) in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those patients with abnormal zeta chain expression, the proportion of lymphocytes with spontaneous DNA fragmentation, as determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assays, was also significantly higher (P &lt; 0.002) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients tested, it was possible to upregulate partially zeta chain expression and hence to reduce the susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by cross-linking the T cells with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-alpha or immobilized CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, such cross-linked T cells showed a significantly higher capacity to proliferate than the native <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> T cells </plain></SENT>
