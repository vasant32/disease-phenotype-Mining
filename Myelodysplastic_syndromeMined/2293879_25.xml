<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (42%) had clonal chromosome anomalies at initial analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common cytogenetic anomalies were: 5q- (11 patients), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (nine patients), -7/7q- (6 patients), 12p- (five patients), followed by structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anomalies of chromosome</z:e> 17 (four patients), and loss of Y chromosome (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of chromosome anomalies was examined by comparison of the significance of single chromosome anomalies (34 patients) versus multiple cytogenetic changes (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple anomalies had a shorter survival (8 months) than patients with single anomalies (18 months) or those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these differences were significant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> was observed in 25% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, 41% of patients with single anomalies, and 50% of patients with multiple changes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, FAB classification and chromosome anomalies were of independent prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sequential cytogenetic studies were performed in 23 patients to correlate the cytogenetic and clinical findings during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients with transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> showed a karyotypic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings agree with the view that an unstable karyotype can be associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
