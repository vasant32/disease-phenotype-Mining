<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1986 in five haematological centers of the west of France (Rennes, Rouen, Nantes, Tours and Angers), we have collected 503 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases were classified by FAB recommendation as followed: 85 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>); 273 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> in which 86 were without blasts (RA), 153 were with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and 34 were with excess of blasts and in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t); 111 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>); and 34 cases with borderline features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The point date for statistical study was 31 December 1988, and the scoring method of Bournemouth was applied to compare with our findings (62% resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 18% in leukemic transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, platelets, and bone marrow-blasts are the best factors to predict survival or leukaemic transformation (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But peripheral neutrophils don't affect the survival time excepted when lower than 500 microliters (13 months vs 19.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A scoring system based on <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), platelets (Pl), and bone marrow blasts (BMB) may be represented in a three-dimensional space and is a good tool to know the own value of each parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This 3-D system shows that BMB and Pl are the most important factors and are correlated with survival, per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and LT (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LT is observed in 18% of the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t progress in AML2 (14.6%) or AML4 (1.4%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> progress in AML2 (8.1%) or AML4 (11.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed that monocytes are not good parameters to predict the type of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, survival of RA treated with Ara-C(ld) or not treated was similar </plain></SENT>
