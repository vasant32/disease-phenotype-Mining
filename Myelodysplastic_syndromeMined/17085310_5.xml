<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If DR15 expression on hematopoietic cells also favors induction of immune responses in an allogeneic setting, a lower relapse rate after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) might result through an enhanced graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed outcome of HLA-identical sibling HSCT in 192 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients carrying the DR15 antigen had a higher estimated 5-year overall survival (76%) than did DR15-negative patients (55%; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improved survival for DR15 patients was due to a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from relapse (5% for DR15(+) versus 24% for DR15(-); P = .02), whereas no difference was seen for rates of transplant-related mortality (19% and 21%, respectively; P = .76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings were confirmed by multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show an association of DR15 with a decreased risk of disease relapse and improved survival after HSCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
