<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only few data are reported on the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> in this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a study on efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> as a single agent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> was administered at 1.3mg/m(2) with a 1, 4, 8, 11-day schedule every 28 days, in 19 patients with IPSS low/intermediate 1 or intermediate2/high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six out of 19 patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> planned eight cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, especially grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; non-hematologic side effects were recorded in 7 patients, but events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of grade 1/2 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to IWG 2006 criteria, 4 out of 19 patients (21%) achieved erythroid response and 9 patients (47%) showed stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with erythroid response bone marrow WT1 levels decreased from a median of 109 copies at baseline to a median of 14 copies at the end of treatment, whereas in patients with stable disease, median WT1 copies increased either in bone marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> used alone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> shows modest hematologic efficacy but appears to affect the WT1 gene expression, which is typically increased in these diseases </plain></SENT>
