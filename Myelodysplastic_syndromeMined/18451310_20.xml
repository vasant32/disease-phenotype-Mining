<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the treatment of 133 patients (median age: 55.6 years [23-73 years]) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 81), myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS; n = 20), and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (n = 32) using conditioning with FBM: fludarabine (5 x 30 mg/m(2)), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, BCNU; 2 x 200 mg/m(2)), and melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients 55 years or older received fludarabine with reduced BCNU (2 x150 mg/m(2)) and melphalan (110 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After engraftment, chimerism analyses revealed complete donor hematopoiesis in 95.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 58.5 months, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 53.0% and 46.1%, event-free survival (EFS) was 46.4% and 41.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in OS and EFS were evident considering disease status (early vs advanced), patient age (&lt;55 vs&gt; or =55 years), or donor type (related vs unrelated) in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to relapse was 20.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after 100 days and 1 year was 15.8% and 26.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>, advanced cases (n = 64, including 61 with active disease) showed an OS of 44.6% and 42.4% after 3 and 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FBM conditioning combines effective disease control with low NRM </plain></SENT>
