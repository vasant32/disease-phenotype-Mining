<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated proteasome ChT-L activity has recently been reported in plasma of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and suggested to have a prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma proteasome ChT-L activity in patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> at early and advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity was assayed using the fluorogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> substrate,<z:chebi fb="9" ids="37952"> Suc</z:chebi>-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, in a cohort of 155 patients with early/advanced rectal (n=43/29), gastric (n=6/13), and breast (n=37/27) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (n=55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median plasma proteasome ChT-L activity was elevated by 20-32% in patients with advanced stage of rectal, gastric, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> compared with healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference turned out to be statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, values in patients with early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were not significantly different from those observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that plasma proteasome activity correlated with serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (r=0.433, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma proteasome ChT-L activity is indicative of advanced stage of rectal, gastric, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the activity does not seem to be a parameter with clinically relevant potential in terms of early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
