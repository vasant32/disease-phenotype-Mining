<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome</z:e> (IHS) is a rare entity of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematological and cardiac involvement is predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of 12 patients with this syndrome, initiated in 1982, is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiological study by repeated echocardiograms and hematological study in peripheral blood and bone marrow upon initiation of the disease were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow up was of 48 +/- 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males predominated (75%) with mean age being 55 +/- 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The principal organs or systems involved were the heart (50%) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 cases with cardiac involvement only 2 had clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed from echocardiographic changes with the principal alterations observed being: atypical occupation of the ventricles, endocardial thickening and mitral and tricuspid subvalvular cumulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic follow-up only showed changes in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hematological involvement was characterized by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypereosinophilia</z:e> formed by mature eosinophils, conservation of other hematopoietic series, absence of blasts in peripheral blood, finding suggestive of diseosinophilopoiesis and appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and cytogenetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival at four years was 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the series studied cardiac involvement is frequent, being principally diagnosed in a subclinical phase and with a very slow echocardiographic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At a hematological level changes typical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
