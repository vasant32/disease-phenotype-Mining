<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A: total of 46 patients with intermediate and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients received CAG regimen and 18 received conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAG regimen: aclarubicin 10 mg/(m2.d)intravenously daily, Day 1~8; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> 10 mg/ m2 subcutaneously once every 12 hours, Day 1~14; and subcutaneously use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 200 mug/(m2.d) until 12 hours before the last use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial outcome was evaluated after the first course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responders received the second course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultimate therapeutic effect was evaluated after the 2 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate in the CAG regimen group was 78.6% (22/28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (46.4%) responded, 5 (17.9%) showed partial response, and 4 (14.3%) hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate in the conventional chemotherapy group was 50%(9/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (33.3%) achieved complete response, 2 (11.1%) partial response, and 1(5.6%) hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate of the CAG group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The adverse effects of CAG regimen were bearable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With acceptable adverse effect, CAG regimen is effective for the intermediate and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-time outcome needs further observation </plain></SENT>
