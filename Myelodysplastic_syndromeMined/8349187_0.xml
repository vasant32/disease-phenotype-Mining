<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) the values of serum erythropoietin were measured at diagnosis and compared with the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A highly significant inverse relationship was found between these two parameters, suggesting that the physiologic mechanism of erythroid progenitor cell recruitment is preserved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen transfusion-dependent patients were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin at the dose of 150 U/Kg three times weekly for at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under recombinant human erythropoietin, three patients became transfusion-independent and 5 had a transient decrease of their transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients under prolonged treatment at the same dose of erythropoietin remain in complete remission after 12 and 15 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A direct relationship between response to erythropoietin treatment and degree of bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo>, coupled to an inverse correlation between response to erythropoietin and baseline serum erythropoietin levels were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, recombinant human erythropoietin may represent an effective treatment modality for selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
