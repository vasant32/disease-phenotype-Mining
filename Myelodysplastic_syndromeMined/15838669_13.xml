<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no standardized approach to evaluate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>International cooperative study groups like the European Working Group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in Childhood (EWOG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) depend, however, on a concordance in diagnoses by their national reference centres for <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In EWOG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the morphological diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases enrolled from Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Italy are established by five experienced pathologists or hematologists cooperating in a <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study their concordance in evaluating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath>, members of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> board initiated blinded reviews of smears of blood and bone marrow aspirates of known cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis were assessed on May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa stained smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a final review of six blinded cases, good concordance for these features was achieved among the five observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurately defined and restrictively applied cellular features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are an important tool to improve and ensure the concordance in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> among investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For cooperative groups, agreement on the evaluation of the morphological assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is a prerequisite </plain></SENT>
