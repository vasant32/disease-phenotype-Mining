<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one sample drawn from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults had TK activities below 10 U/l (4.75 +/- 1.60 U/l) On the other hand, most TK activities in patient sera were remarkably elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the TK activities in non-remission and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase were especially high in contrast with those in remission and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TK activities in the supernatants derived from cultured and frozen leukemic cells were significantly higher than those in the supernatants derived from lymphocytes and spleen cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the high level of TK activity in patient sera comes from malignant cells and serves as a good marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass </plain></SENT>
