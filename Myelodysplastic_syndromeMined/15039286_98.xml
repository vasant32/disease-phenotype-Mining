<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the optimal timing of HLA-matched BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is unknown, we constructed a Markov model to examine 3 transplantation strategies for newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: transplantation at diagnosis, transplantation at leukemic progression, and transplantation at an interval from diagnosis but prior to leukemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses using individual patient risk-assessment data from transplantation and nontransplantation registries were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups with adjustments for quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For low and intermediate-1 IPSS groups, delayed transplantation maximized overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation prior to leukemic transformation was associated with a greater number of life years than transplantation at the time of leukemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of patients under the age of 40 years, an even more marked survival advantage for delayed transplantation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For intermediate-2 and high IPSS groups, transplantation at diagnosis maximized overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes in the optimal transplantation strategies were noted when QoL adjustments were incorporated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For low- and intermediate-1-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, delayed BMT is associated with maximal life expectancy, whereas immediate transplantation for intermediate-2- and high-risk disease is associated with maximal life expectancy </plain></SENT>
