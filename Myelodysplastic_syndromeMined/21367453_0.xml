<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigate the clinical significance of CD34+ megakaryocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD34 on megakaryocytes was assessed on BM biopsies obtained from 202 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-level (â‰¥20%) CD34 expression on megakaryocytes was found in BM of 29 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD34 on megakaryocytes is correlated with severe cytopenia, higher numbers of myeloblasts, more frequent and higher risk cytogenetic abnormalities, and a shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of CD34 on megakaryocytes could be a strong and an independent poor prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with a hazard ratio of 2.53 </plain></SENT>
