<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously shown in a pediatric Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) population that a non-invasive oral rinse can be used to monitor engraftment, neutrophil tissue delivery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> post-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the same oral rinse protocol, we studied neutrophil tissue delivery kinetics and its relationship to clinical parameters and outcomes following HSCT in 29 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral neutrophil counts were compared to circulating neutrophil levels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e> scores and patient health status at 6 months post-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neutrophils were detected on average 8.4 Â± 3.4 SD days earlier in the oral tissues than in the blood circulation, enabling us to confirm successful engraftment more than one week earlier than when using blood neutrophil counts alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As well, in this population the time-span between oral engraftment (OE) and blood engraftment (BE) was a consistent predictor of treatment outcome at 6 months following HSCT where a BE-OE of &lt;6 days resulted in 100% of patients having a negative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that monitoring the timing of neutrophil delivery to the oral tissues with a non-invasive oral rinse has the potential to allow the physician to identify those patients who are at a high risk of HSCT failure within just a few weeks of the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
