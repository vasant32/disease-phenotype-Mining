<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification is one of the mechanisms for activating proto-oncogenes resulting in an enhanced expression of the corresponding gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), amplification of the proto-oncogene MLL has been described only in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report five new patients (four had de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, one had a de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) displaying different mechanisms of MLL amplification, suspected by G-banding and confirmed by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, MLL was amplified on double-minute chromosomes (dmins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, an interstitial deletion in 11q23 including the MLL gene was associated with the occurrence of the dmins containing MLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a rarely described mechanism, MLL amplification in the form of size-variable ring chromosomes was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remodeling of the ring chromosomes leads to multiple copies of MLL and obviously provided a selective growth advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one of the two cases with ring chromosomes, the centromeric alpha-satellite DNA of the ring chromosome was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our fifth patient showed the unique finding of MLL amplification within a uniformly (homogeneously?) stained region in interaction with amplified ribosomal DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, one of the patients with ring chromosomes exhibited the amplification of ribosomal DNA on the ring chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transcriptionally active genes for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> could probably enhance the expression of MLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one of our five patients, we found the new combination of concomitant amplification of the proto-oncogenes MLL and MYC </plain></SENT>
