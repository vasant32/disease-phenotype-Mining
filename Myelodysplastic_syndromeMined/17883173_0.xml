<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with increased blasts (N = 35) according to FAB criteria, presenting (between Jan 2004 to June 2005) to the Department of Hematology, AIIMS were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was done for the AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> fusion transcript in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence of AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> was 28.57% and no correlation was found between AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> positivity and clinical or hematological parameters except for a direct correlation with absolute blast count (ABC) (a lower ABC in the AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> positive cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 1/3 MDS cases were positive for the same fusion transcript and thus, it appears worthwhile to look for AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with increased blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective morphological evaluation using a scoring system based on morphological features was not helpful in predicting positivity for AML1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of this translocation on long-term survival could not be determined by the present study </plain></SENT>
