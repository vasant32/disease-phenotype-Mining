<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation could modify lymphocyte function via oxidative damage, DNA breaks, and resulting changes of proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cellular senescence, where telomeres may play a critical role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effect of low-dose irradiation on the telomere length and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates in peripheral blood lymphocytes of irradiated persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A study was performed on 83 peripheral blood samples from the Chornobyl clean-up workers, radiation workers exposed under the professional limits at construction works at the "Shelter" object and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow leukocyte telomere length was estimated in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> secondary to low-dose radiation exposure and 12 age-standardized healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative telomere length was studied by the combination of a fluorescence hybridization in situ with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> probe and flow cytometry, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> - by Annexin-V test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant relative telomere length decrease has been demonstrated in Chornobyl clean-up workers compared to healthy donors (13.2 ± 0.69 and 18.6 ± 0.73 respectively, p &lt; 0.05), and a tendency (p &lt; 0.1) in radiation workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At doses over professional limits an inverse dependency is demonstrated between the relative telomere length and a number of lymphocytes in early stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group a tendency of telomere elongation was demonstrated in bone marrow granulocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> as comparing with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows telomere shortening after low-dose irradiation and preservation of these changes even 20 years after exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction is possible by the telomere region changes at least in individuals with shorter telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clonal transformation is associated with a substantially longer telomeres </plain></SENT>
