<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>4 patients with hereditary sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (HSA), belonging to two families, were therefore treated with haem arginate infusions, 3 mg/kg, on 4 consecutive days, and thereafter weekly for 10 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No effect was observed on the mildly anaemic <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels or on the red cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the initially low or low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid to erythroid ratio in the marrow increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A consistent decrease in the percentage of ring sideroblasts and other abnormal sideroblasts was seen in 1 patient (Family A), and a temporary decrease of abnormal sideroblasts took place during the most intensive treatment period in 2 other patients (Family B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of three initially abnormal haem synthesising enzyme activities became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Family A, whereas no clearly consistent effects on the haem synthesising enzymes were observed in Family B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that haem arginate infusions can normalise the activities of haem synthesising enzymes in some patients with HSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of haem infusions on the iron balance of these patients </plain></SENT>
