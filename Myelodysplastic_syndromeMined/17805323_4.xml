<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible contribution of activated monocytes through CD40-CD40L(CD154) interactions with activated T helper cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated in 77 predominantly lower risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients that the CD40 receptor was expressed significantly higher on monocytes and that CD40L was expressed significantly higher on T helper cells in peripheral blood (PB) and BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of CD40 and CD40L were detected in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, stimulation of the CD40 receptor on purified PB monocytes led to a significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha production in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-culture of BM mononuclear cells of 21 patients in the presence of a blocking CD40 monoclonal antibody (ch5D12) led to a significant increase in the number of colony-forming units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was seen between increased CD40 expression on monocytes with patients' age below 60 years and with the cytogenetic abnormality <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that CD40 expression on monocytes may identify a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in whom immune-mediated hematopoietic failure is part of the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, the CD40-CD40L-based activation of monocytes might be a target to counteract <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-related BM failure </plain></SENT>
