<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe two new human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, MOLM-13 and MOLM-14, established from the peripheral blood of a patient at relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, FAB M5a, which had evolved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines express monocyte-specific esterase (MSE) and MLL-AF9 fusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene fusion is associated with a minute chromosomal insertion, ins(11;9)(q23;p22p23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MOLM-13 and MOLM-14 are the first cell lines with, and represent the third reported case of, MLL gene rearrangement arising via chromosomal insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines carry <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 which was also present during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> phase, as well as the most frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> associated with t(9;11), ie, +6, +13, +19 variously present in different subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite having these features in common, differences in antigen expression were noted between the two cell lines: that of MOLM-13 being CD34+, CD13-, CD14-, CD15+, CD33+; whereas MOLM-14 was CD4+, CD13+, CD14+, CD15+, CD33+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differentiation to macrophage-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> could be induced in both cell lines after stimulation with INF-gamma alone, or in combination with TNF-alpha, which treatment also induced or upregulated, expression of certain myelomonocyte-associated antigens, including CD13, CD14, CD15, CD64, CD65 and CD87 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these data confirm that both cell lines are likely to be novel in vitro models for studying monocytic differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
