<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported on the lack of prognostic significance for SF3B1 mutations in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RS and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (PMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined the prevalence and prognostic relevance of SRSF2 mutations in PMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 187 patients screened, 32 (17%) harbored SRSF2 monoallelic mutations affecting residue P95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant associations were demonstrated between SRSF2 mutations and advanced age (P &lt; .01), IDH mutations (P &lt; .01), and higher DIPSS-plus risk category (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SRSF2 mutations were associated with shortened overall (P &lt; .01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free (P &lt; .01) survival; the adverse effect on survival was independent of DIPSS-plus (P = .01; HR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0) and IDH mutations (P &lt; .01; HR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SRSF2 mutations are relatively common in PMF, cluster with IDH mutations, and are independently predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
