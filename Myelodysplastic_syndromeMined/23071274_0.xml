<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DNA-hypomethylating agents <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> are effective treatments for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, increasing the time to progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and improving overall response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although genome-wide increases in DNA methylation have been documented in BM cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the methylation signatures of specific gene promoters have not been correlated with the clinical response to these therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, attention has been drawn to the potential etiologic role of decreased expression of specific ribosomal proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in other BM failure states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether rRNA expression is dysregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found significantly decreased rRNA expression and increased rDNA promoter methylation in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of myeloid cell lines with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> resulted in a significant decrease in the methylation of the rDNA promoter and an increase in rRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that an increase in rDNA promoter methylation can result in decreased rRNA synthesis that may contribute to defective hematopoiesis and BM failure in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
