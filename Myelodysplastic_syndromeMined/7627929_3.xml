<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a series of 2270 MDS patients analyzed between 1983 and 1994 (Center for Human Genetics, Leuven), 9 cases were found with translocations involving the X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These aberrations were not restricted to specific FAB subtypes and were the sole anomalies in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 6 patients, they were associated with other abnormalities, including 5q-, observed in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was retrospectively performed on 8 patients and was shown to be a useful complement for the characterization of the translocations involving the X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, we could identify translocation partners and breakpoint regions only by using chromosome painting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No recurrent chromosome partners were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints could be localized along the whole X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a cluster in the Xq13 region involved in 4 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The previously reported association of Xq13 anomalies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) was found in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of characteristic translocations involving the X chromosome, the occurrence of such changes as the sole karyotypic anomaly suggests that they could play a role in the pathogenesis of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
