<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify potential effector and target cells in this regulatory pathway, we examined the constitutive expression of Fas receptor (Fas) and FasL (total and cell-surface) in myeloid and lymphoid cells and subsets of CD34+ cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy adult human bone marrow using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of CD34+ cells constitutively expressed cell-surface FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, none of the CD34+ cells expressed Fas alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal gradient of expression of FasL and Fas was observed in subsets of CD34+ cells: as compared to primitive CD34+/HLA-DR(-) (DR(-)) cells, a higher proportion of committed CD34+/HLA-DR(++) (DR(++)) cells expressed FasL but fewer expressed Fas; the expression of both molecules was intermediate in CD34+/HLA-DR(dim) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the intensity of FasL expression was higher in DR(++) than in DR(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the homeostatic regulation of myelopoiesis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow is mediated via an autoregulatory feedback loop by myeloid cells and progenitors themselves, at least partly via the Fas-FasL pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This notion is also consistent with our recent observation that overexpression of FasL by myeloid cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> correlates directly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, transfusion requirements, and shorter survival, an example of dysregulation of this pathway </plain></SENT>
