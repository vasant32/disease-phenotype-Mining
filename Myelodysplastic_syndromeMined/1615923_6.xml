<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The French-American-British classification, established in 1976 and subsequently revised, allows only for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemias</z:e> whose immature elements are predominated by myeloid blasts, previously described as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">DiGuglielmo's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is another form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e>, in which the predominant immature elements are proerythroblasts, called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">DiGuglielmo's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, 23 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> were reviewed and classified: 10 with a myeloblast predominance and 13 with a proerythroblastic predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> can be distinguished on the basis of quantitative and qualitative morphologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When there were 30% or more proerythroblasts, calculated by dividing the total erythroid component into the proerythroblasts, there were few to no myeloblasts, no Auer rods, and increased cytoplasmic vacuoles; and myeloperoxidase staining was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The malignant proerythroblasts had increased block and blush <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities involved chromosomes 5 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">DiGuglielmo's disease</z:e> had a median survival time of 2 months (range, 0.06 to 9 months), compared to a median of 16 months (range, 2 to 48 months), in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">DiGuglielmo's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> with the preponderance of proerythroblasts had a worse prognosis because many of the individuals did not survive long enough to respond to the therapy initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Erythroleukemia</z:e> with 30% or more proerythroblasts should be included in the French-American-British classification because it behaves clinically and appears morphologically as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> rather than a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
