<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ANL) were treated with intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complete remission (CR) was obtained in six patients (24 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five of these six patients two courses of chemotherapy were needed to achieve CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight patients chemotherapy cleared the bone marrow of blasts, but the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A partial effect on bone marrow blasts was seen in four patients and no effect in another six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (44 per cent) died from the consequences of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A short interval between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and transformation into ANL was associated with a better chance of achieving complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, karyotype, type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, peripheral blood or bone marrow findings had no influence on the result of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival from start of treatment was 5 months (range 0.5-24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients who achieved a CR, the median duration of the remission was 7 months (range 3-12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The poor response rate, the short duration of the remissions and the high treatment-related mortality suggest that current intensive anti-leukemic chemotherapy in ANL after primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is of limited benefit </plain></SENT>
