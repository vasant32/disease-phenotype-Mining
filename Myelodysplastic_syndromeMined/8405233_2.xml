<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 191 patients (85 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>], 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [ALL], 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>], 17 SAA, and nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>]) who were in hematologic remission 6 months to 13 years after either curative chemotherapy (n = 69) or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (n = 122) by culturing their precursor cells from bone marrow (BM) (n = 548) and peripheral blood (PB) (n = 529) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six BM donors and 25 PB donors served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BM colony-forming cell numbers were abnormally low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (p &lt; 0.002) irrespective of underlying disorder and type of treatment (chemotherapy or irradiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These numbers did not normalize with time--colony-forming cells were still strongly reduced up to 10 years after therapy, whether or not the patient had received an allogeneic bone marrow graft (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also compared patients who remained in stable hematologic remission with those who later relapsed (6 months to 2 years after treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM colony-forming cell numbers were significantly lower in patients who subsequently relapsed (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BM cultures, we found <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony-forming capacity by PB precursors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) after chemotherapy or BMT, colony-forming cell numbers of BM in culture are permanently reduced; (2) this defect is probably due to a dysfunction of the BM environment rather than to a numerical reduction of the precursor cell pool; and (3) very low colony-forming capacity may be related to relapse </plain></SENT>
