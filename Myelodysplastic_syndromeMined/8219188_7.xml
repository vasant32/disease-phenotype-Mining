<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considering the beneficial effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL), it has been speculated that ATRA might also be useful for treating other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we performed a dose-escalating 3-month-trial of ATRA in 15 patients with primary or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologic diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) in 4, RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) in 2, RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in 7, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/T) in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients included were required to have one or more of the following criteria: transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 20 x 10(9)/L), or increasing blast cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy was started at an ATRA dose of 30 mg/m2/d, administered orally as two doses of 15 mg/m2 every 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> dose was increased to 60 mg/m2/d after 4 weeks and to 90 mg/m2/d after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 14 patients assessable for response, none obtained a complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a minor response, manifested by either reduction in transfusion requirements (2 patients) or increase in neutrophil and platelet counts (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 5 patients progressed to more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients with chromosomal abnormalities receiving ATRA for a period of 10 to 12 weeks retained their cytogenetic marker after completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Side effects of ATRA primarily affected the skin and mucous membranes, with 13 of 15 patients having at least low-grade dermatologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, treatment had to be prematurely stopped because of intolerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> or progressive neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ATRA has little effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lack of response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, as compared with those with APL, may be attributed to the absence of the t(15;17) translocation that seems to be a prerequisite for clinical efficacy of ATRA </plain></SENT>
