<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 20% of the patients were in first complete remission (CR) at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-compatible related (n = 60) or matched unrelated (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CR rate for 54 patients with active disease was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 12 months, 1-year regimen-related and treatment-related mortalities were 1% and 3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
