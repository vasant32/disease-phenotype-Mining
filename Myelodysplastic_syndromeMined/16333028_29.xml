<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1214 patients with early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of FEC14 (604 patients) or of FEC21 (610 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations were assessed by multivariable analysis with adjustment for age; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size; grade; proliferative rate; and menopausal, lymph node, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> receptor status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the FEC14 arm had fewer dose reductions or treatment delays or discontinuation (26%) than those in the FEC21 arm (33%) (difference = 7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2% to 12%; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FEC14 therapy, compared with FEC21 therapy, was associated with more asthenia (36% versus 29%, difference = 7%, 95% CI = 2% to 12%; P = .01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> (33% versus 4%, difference = 29%, 95% CI = 25% to 33%; P &lt; .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (38% versus 19%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 14% to 24%; P &lt; .001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (8% versus 2%, difference = 6%, 95% CI = 4% to 9%; P &lt; .001), but with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (12% versus 45%, difference = 33%, 95% CI = 28% to 37%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 10.4 years, no statistically significant difference in the hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.13) or recurrence (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.08) was found between FEC14 and FEC21 groups after adjustment by multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the study was underpowered for subset analysis, we found no evidence that the effect of the treatment type was associated with any of the potential prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support the long-term safety of FEC14 chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this therapy was not associated with improved outcome, but because of the limited statistical power of our study, we cannot rule out a modest improvement in outcome associated with FEC14 therapy </plain></SENT>
