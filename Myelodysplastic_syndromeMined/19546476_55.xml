<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism behind their clinical efficacy remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the methylation dynamics of 4 TSGs (p15(INK4B), CDH-1, DAPK-1, and SOCS-1) were studied in sequential bone marrow samples from 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) who completed a minimum of 4 cycles of therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> and entinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reversal of promoter methylation after therapy was observed in both clinical responders and nonresponders across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no association between clinical response and either baseline methylation or methylation reversal in the bone marrow or purified CD34(+) population, nor was there an association with change in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient global hypomethylation was observed in samples after treatment but was not associated with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3/H4 acetylation and the DNA damage-associated variant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> gamma-H2AX was observed in peripheral blood samples across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, methylation reversal of candidate TSGs during cycle 1 of therapy was not predictive of clinical response to combination "epigenetic" therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT00101179 </plain></SENT>
