<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a phase III randomized clinical trial to compare two myeloablative conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: After randomization, 64 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (3.2 mg/kg per day × 4 days) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg per day × 2 days; BuCy), and 62 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (same dose and schedule) plus fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) per day × 5 days; BuFlu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 41 years (range, 17 to 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients in the BuFlu arm experienced graft failure (primary, n = 1; secondary, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks after HCT, the median percentage of recipient hematopoietic chimerism was significantly greater in the BuFlu arm (0% v 5.5%; P &lt; .001), and complete donor chimerism was greater in the BuCy arm (97.2% v 44.4%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe (grade 3 or higher) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more common in the BuCy arm, but the frequencies of hepatic adverse events were similar in the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality was similar in the two arms, but the BuCy arm had better overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>), and event-free survival (EFS; OS at 2 years, 67.4% v 41.4%, P = .014; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, 74.7% v 54.9%, P = .027; EFS, 60.7% v 36.0%, P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the BuFlu regimen is not a suitable replacement for the BuCy regimen in young adults who are eligible for myeloablative conditioning therapy for allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
