<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD34(+) cell cDNA libraries were constructed using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from adult bone marrow and from a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>-M5 transformed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs were generated by sequencing and were annotated using bioinformatic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 4142 ESTs obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, 3424 meaningful tags were integrated into 1630 clusters, representing 622 known genes, 522 dbEST entries and 486 novel sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 5382 ESTs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 1985 clusters were produced based on the analysis of 4321 useful ESTs, including 711 known genes, 657 known ESTs and 617 novel sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 251 transcripts found in both bone marrow and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> EST datasets and those present in only one dataset, 58 showed statistically significant differences in EST copy numbers between the two tissues (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty putative full-length cDNAs for novel genes were also cloned from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distinct gene expression patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-CD34(+) cells as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control cells may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of the malignant phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
