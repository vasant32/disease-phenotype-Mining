<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the ultrastructural characteristics of erythroblasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) which might be of additional importance in understanding its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 22 patients were classified according to FAB (French-American-British classification), IPSS (international prognostic score system), cytogenetic risk factors and transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using electron microscopy, in 77% of the cases, nuclear abnormalities consisting of disrupted membranes and cystic/dilated perinuclear spaces were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a limited number of patients (n=7), a low percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the erythroid lineage (mean 3.1+/-1.6%; median 3%: range 1-6) (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls: &lt;0.5%) could be noted, primarily in mature erythroblasts and significantly associated with spongiform nuclear features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and myelin figures in erythroblasts were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55% of the cases, enlarged and abnormal mitochondria were observed, significantly associated with iron-accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse relation existed between the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and more advanced, or high risk disease and cytogenetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> abnormalities were significantly correlated with high risk disease as well with an increase in transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play a role in early stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall prominent defects in mitochondria might be an additional defect that is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
