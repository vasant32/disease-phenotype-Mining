<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In phase I, the MTD of once daily oral doses of tosedostat in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In phase II, the therapeutic activity of the maximum-acceptable dose (MAD) of tosedostat was evaluated in elderly and/or relapsing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In phase I, 16 patients were treated in four cohorts with tosedostat (60 mg to 180 mg) for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients reported dose-limiting toxicities: two with reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (&gt; 75% reduction in platelet count) at 180 mg (MTD) and one with a Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 ALT elevation at 130 mg (MAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In phase II, 41 patients were treated with 130 mg tosedostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In phases I and II, the most common severe (CTC grades 3 to 5) adverse event was a reduction in the platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 51 AML patients in this study, seven reached complete marrow response (&lt; 5% marrow blasts), with three achieving complete remission, and a further seven patients reaching a partial marrow response (between 5% and 15% marrow blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was therefore 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responders were age &gt; 60 years, and 79% had either relapsed or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This phase I/II study demonstrates that oral once daily dosing with 130 mg tosedostat is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The favorable risk-benefit profile suggests that further clinical trials are warranted </plain></SENT>
