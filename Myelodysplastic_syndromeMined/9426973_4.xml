<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its role, and especially that of soluble IFN-gamma receptor (sIFN-gamma R), in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the sera of 27 patients following BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of them underwent uneventful BMT, whereas 13 developed transplant-related complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (n = 5), early rejection (n = 4), or relapse of basic disease (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soluble IFN-gamma R and IFN levels were evaluated at day -10 (preconditioning), day 0 (day of BMT), day of engraftment, and during BMT-related complications using sIFN-gamma R-specific monoclonal antibodies (McAB) followed by double-sandwich ELISA, and a sensitive radioimmunoassay respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 80) sIFN-gamma R and IFN-gamma levels in the sera were 0.5 +/- 0.05 and 0.3 +/- 0.04 ng/ml respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soluble IFN-gamma R levels increased in direct correlation with engraftment (0.63 +/- 0.11 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 1.43 +/- 0.16 ng/ml at the day of engraftment; n = 14; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma levels increased in direct correlation with engraftment (0.37 +/- 0.03 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 5.69 +/- 1.64 ng/ml at the day of engraftment; n = 14; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five patients with GVHD sIFN-gamma R levels increased from 0.43 +/- 0.19 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 1.73 +/- 0.17 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.004) at the time of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, IFN-gamma levels increased from 0.43 +/- 0.08 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 3.03 +/- 0.5 ng/ml at the time of GVHD (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both graft rejection and early relapse were associated with an elevation of IFN-gamma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In short, both s-IFN-gamma R and IFN-gamma were found to be significantly elevated during engraftment and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence these cytokines may be used as a tool for assessing engraftment and AGVHD </plain></SENT>
