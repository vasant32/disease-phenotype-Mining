<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the clinical relevance of mixed chimerism (MC) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we developed a method based on amplification of DNA minisatellites by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sensitive method by which MC lower than 1% can be detected is applicable to any patient-donor pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because the analysis requires only small amounts of DNA, it allowed us to analyze samples early after BMT and during graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were obtained within 48 hours after blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of MC in granulocytes (GR) and in mononuclear cells (Mnc) was performed in 20 patients treated for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who received untreated BM, recipient cells disappeared rapidly after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients transplanted with T-cell-depleted BM, MC occurred in 15 of 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of host Mnc was always significantly higher than the percentage of host GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evolution of MC in patients who received T-cell-depleted marrow showed distinct patterns depending on whether patients remained in continuous complete remission, relapsed, or rejected their grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During complete remission, a relatively stable and significant number of host cells could be detected during the first 2 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, their number decreased, but even after 4 years, low numbers of host cells could persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the patients relapsed, an increase in host Mnc was monitored without significant changes in the number of donor Mnc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after the relapse, donor GR were no longer detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two cases of graft rejection were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Directly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the rejection, donor GR and Mnc disappeared rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During that period, no significant changes in the number of host Mnc were detected </plain></SENT>
