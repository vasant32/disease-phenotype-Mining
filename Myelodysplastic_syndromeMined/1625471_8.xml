<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical, haematological and outcome data were studied in 84 patients with acquired idiopathic sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AISA) from a registry of 613 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) recorded by five institutions in western France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups could be identified and compared: 'pure' erythroblastic AISA (AISA-E: 59 pts), and AISA with myelodysplastic features, i.e. dysgranulo and/or dysmegakaryopoiesis (AISA-M: 25 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were also compared to those of a series of 71 cases of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679425" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sideroblastosis</z:e> (RA) carried out from the same registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dyserythropoiesis was present in 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AISA subtypes, dysgranulopoiesis in 88% of the AISA-M cases; dysmegakaryopoiesis was observed in 44% of AISA-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with both forms of AISA showed high platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases appeared particular in that four of them were associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and/or a hyperleucocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had to be distinguished from myeloproliferative syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome comparison of AISA-E with AISA-M showed a significant discrepancy of survival duration (60 vs 38 months respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression towards refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, was significantly higher for AISA-M than for AISA-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of transformation increased to 24% for the AISA-M group similarly to those of RA patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that AISA must be divided into two categories, 'pure' AISA and AISA-M, because survival duration and risk of transformation are different </plain></SENT>
