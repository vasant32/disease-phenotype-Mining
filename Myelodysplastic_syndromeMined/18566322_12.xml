<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported that transgenic mice expressing NHD13 develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that more than half of these mice eventually progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latency period suggests a requirement for at least 1 complementary event before leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a candidate gene search for complementary events focused on genes that are frequently mutated in human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated 22 ANLL samples and found a high frequency of Nras and Kras mutations, an absence of Npm1, p53, Runx1, Kit and Flt3 mutations, and a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings support a working hypothesis that predicts that ANLL cases have one mutation which inhibits differentiation, and a complementary mutation which enhances proliferation or inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide the first evidence for spontaneous collaborating mutations in a genetically engineered mouse model of ANLL </plain></SENT>
