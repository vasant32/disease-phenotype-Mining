<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in advanced stage were enriched for blasts and tested for (1) karyotype, (2) genomic configuration and (3) expression of IL-3, GM-CSF, FMS and EGR-1 genes which are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located on the long arm of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of the M-CSF gene, that has been recently reassigned to the short arm of chromosome 1 (lp), was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aims of the study were to (1) assess the potential role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clones and (2) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one allele followed by a deletion of the second allele of the same genes in the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter issue was investigated by comparing, in 8 cases, constitutive DNA from skin fibroblasts with leukemic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The M-CSF gene was expressed in 6 cases and the FMS and the EGR-1 genes were expressed in 2 of the latter cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An autocrine mechanism of growth could be hypothesized only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the M-CSF and FMS genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does not seem to represent a major mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
