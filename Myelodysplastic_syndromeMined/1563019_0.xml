<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the inability of interferon to restore the defective natural killer activity, natural killer cells and lectin-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary we detected a boosting effect on the depressed polymorphonuclear cell cytotoxic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our view, the ability of interferon to potentiate polymorphonuclear cell lytic efficiency could support an alternative defensive pathway against either neoplastic or infectious agents </plain></SENT>
