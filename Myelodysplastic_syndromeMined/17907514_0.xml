<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no report describing the course after splenectomy in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of splenectomy on the outcome of six children with juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>) who had no HLA identical donor and who became unresponsive to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, increased erythrocyte transfusion requirement and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> were the indications for splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> values and platelet counts improved following splenectomy in five out of the six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte transfusion requirements decreased and none of the patients who responded received erythrocyte transfusion for at least six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the quality of life improved markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mortality related to splenectomy was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, splenectomy may be considered as a safe supportive treatment approach for some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
