<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in actuarial survival and probability of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> were found in patients with RA, AISA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median survival time for the RA group was 50 months, for the AISA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> subclasses more than 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of transformation for the RA, AISA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> subgroups showed a linear trend with a probability of 25% for the RA, 16% for the AISA and of 18% for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> groups after a 5 year observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A uniformly poor prognosis was found for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/t subgroups with median survival times of respectively 9 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 68 out of 155 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases or with abnormal metaphases together with karyotypic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells had a longer median survival time and a lower probability for transformation as compared to those with only abnormal metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important factor in prognosis is the number of blast cells in blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age and sex, and certain quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the peripheral blood appear of limited prognostic value for patients with RA, AISA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The longer life expectancy of 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> as compared to other series seems to be related to the percentage of blast cells at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
