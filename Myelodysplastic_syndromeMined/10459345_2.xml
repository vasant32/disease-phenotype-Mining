<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> patients develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after 3-4 years of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, mainly melphalan; chromosomes 5 and 7 are most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 14 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe to 5q31 (the critical area of deletion on chromosome 5) to verify whether deletion of 5q31 occurs during the course of stable, uncomplicated <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, and to assess the clinical importance of this abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 2 patients (14%) with deletion of 5q31 in 30-40% of their peripheral white blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with this deletion received a high cumulative amount of melphalan, and the other patient was treated with multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, including melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, no clinical or laboratory evidence of transformation occurred 14 and 12 months after the finding of the aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that 5q-may occur months prior to the overt development of (t)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and raise important concerns regarding the management of patients with this and similar aberrations, including modification of treatment and performance of cytogenetic evaluation prior to autologous or PSC transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biological implications of these findings should be evaluated in larger clinical and laboratory studies </plain></SENT>
