<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Data on the use of combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> and caspofungin followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi>, as maintenance or further rescue treatment, in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">invasive mycosis</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1) and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">invasive mycosis</z:e> (proven, 3; probable, 6; and possible, 1) refractory to first-line antifungal treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rescue therapy with a combination of caspofungin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2682">liposomal amphotericin B</z:chebi> was well tolerated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> being the most common side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy was administered for a median of 17 d, range 6-40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the nine patients with proven or probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycosis</z:e>, one was not evaluated because of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> whilst in the remaining eight patients, the response was classified as complete, stable and failure in four, three, and one patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete response was also observed in patient with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> for a median of 75 d, range 42-194 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> was well tolerated although some drug interactions were observed during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 125 d, nine of 10 patients are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, a favorable response to antifungal treatment (including the case of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycosis</z:e>) was obtained in eight of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that medical antifungal treatment may be intensified in severely ill patients without significantly compromising patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of synergistic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi> as well as their sequential use warrants further investigation by a larger randomized controlled study </plain></SENT>
