<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control groups included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and marrow from cases presenting with pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double-immunostaining was applied with a monoclonal antibody (PC10) directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), followed by antibodies against glycophorin C (Ret40f) or platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIIa (Y2/51-CD61) for the identification of the erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow showed a reduction of erythropoiesis accompanied by an increase in atypical (micro-) megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythroid precursors displayed significant enhancement of PCNA-immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytes showed no increase in the relative frequency of PC10-positive cells (PCNA-labelling index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, predominance of macrocytic-megaloblastoid erythropoiesis was associated with a striking increase in PCNA-labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell kinetic studies in this disorder revealed an abnormal arrest, particularly in S-phase which generates an over-expression of PCNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar conditions were believed to be present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with secondary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mechanism explains the relatively high rate of positively-reacting pro- and erythroblasts which is not invariably accompanied by an increase in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Determination of megakaryocyte size and PCNA-staining capacity resulted in a significant increase in PC10-positive cells among micromegakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings on this cell lineage are in keeping with the assumption of a block in endoreduplicative activity at higher ploidy levels, associated with an apparently not-deregulated endomitosis in small-sized megakaryocytes of lower ploidy stages </plain></SENT>
