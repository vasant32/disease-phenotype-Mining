<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate whether in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) exists mitochoudria <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase COI and COII gene mutations different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and to analyze whether these mutations are "hot spot" mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients aged from 20 to 70 years old were brought into this study, including 2 of RA, 3 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, 7 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 5 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (transformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and 1 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total DNA was extracted both from bone marrow cells and buccal cells of the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pair of primers was designed to amplify a fragment with 528 base pair (7181 - 7709) by PCR technique, which contained high frequency mutation area of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase COI and COII gene based on the literature reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR products were purified and sequenced as bidirection to confirm if there is any mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of sequence of COI and COII gene from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient bone marrow cells were compared with both the standard sequence from GenBank and the sequence from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient buccal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 3 single nucleotide changes in 528 bp <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase gene fragment from 18 MDS patients were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were 7674 T--&gt;C, 7353 A--&gt;G, and an insert mutation of G at 7702 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The former two mutations caused isoleucine--&gt;methionine, and methionine--&gt;viline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 7702G ins was only confirmed with marrow cells in a patient, and caused a frame shift, which suggested that the mutation might be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that some of "hot spots" of mtDNA mutation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase (COI, COII) gene from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are failed to be confirmed, but 3 new mutations on this gene are found, which suggested that mitochondria DNA mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients still have much complexity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, mtDNA mutation may be a prophase or an accompany phenomenon of this disease </plain></SENT>
