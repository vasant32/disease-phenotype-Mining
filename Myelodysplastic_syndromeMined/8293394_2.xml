<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The records and initial bone marrow studies of 106 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was predictive of a previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorder</z:mpath> or correlated with remission rate and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens were reviewed in a blinded fashion; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was assessed in as objective a manner as possible by numerically scoring nine specific findings: erythrocyte multinuclearity, nuclear fragmentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> characteristics, leukocyte granulation abnormalities and nuclear malformations, Pelger-Huet cells, and megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mononuclear megakaryocytes, micromegakaryocytes, and megakaryocytes with multiple distinct nuclei) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> of the megakaryocytic line was seen in 34% of patients; 70% of the patients had erythrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; and 68% had leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pelger-Huet cells were seen in bone marrow of 35% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> score and specific dysplastic findings such as Pelger-Huet cells did not correlate with a known history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (P = 0.47), cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.35), prior chemotherapy treatment with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (P = 1.00), previous malignant disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (P = 1.00), remission rate (P = 0.93), or survival (P = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed known independent risk factors for remission in this patient population, including age (P = 0.04), history of prior chemotherapy (P = 0.04), abnormalities in chromosomes 5, 7, or 8 (P = 0.02), and type of antileukemia therapy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and does not correlate with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or predict outcome when patients are treated with standard intensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
