<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the functional properties of primary mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were analyzed in the presence or absence of lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to healthy controls, clonality and growth were reduced across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, differentiation defects and particular expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and cell surface molecules (e.g. CD166, CD29, CD146) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the levels of stromal derived factor 1-alpha (SDF-1α) in patients' cells culture supernatants were almost 2-fold lower (p&lt;0.01) compared to controls and this was paralleled by a reduced induction of migration of CD34+ hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cocultures of mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with CD34+ cells from healthy donors resulted in reduced numbers of cobblestone area forming-cells and fewer colony forming units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of stromal cells from patients and controls to lenalidomide led to a further reduction of SDF-1α secretion and cobblestone area formation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lenalidomide pretreatment of mesenchymal stromal cells from low but not high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was able to rescue impaired erythroid and myeloid colony formation of early hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our analyses support the notion that the stromal microenvironment is involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> thus representing a potential target for therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
