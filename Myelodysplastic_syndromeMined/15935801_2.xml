<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1981, a preparation containing more than 1% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is not allowed to be manufactured, used or dealt with in the workplace, except in laboratories and in those situations <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> must be used in a completely sealed process as specified in Industrial Safety and Health Act (ISHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Claims for compensation of hematopoietic diseases related to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> have been rising even though the work environment has been improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess the status of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure in different industries in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the claimed cases investigated by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA) between 1992 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Survey of National Work Environment Status in 1998 was analyzed to assume the number of workers and factories exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2000, six factories were investigated to evaluate <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Personal air monitoring was performed in 61 workers and urine samples were collected from 57 workers to measure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27036">trans,trans-muconic acid</z:chebi> (t,t-MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematologic examination has performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cases of hematopoietic diseases were investigated by KOSHA including eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight cases were accepted as related to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of workers possibly exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> can be estimated to be 196,182 workers from 6219 factories based on the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in air was 0.094 (0.005-5.311) ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven samples were higher than 1 ppm but they did not go over the 10 ppm occupational exposure limit (OEL) value in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27036">trans,trans-muconic acid</z:chebi> in urine was 0.966 (0.24-2.74) mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure level was low except in a factory where <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was used to polymerize other chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The ambient <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> from 0.1 to 1 ppm was significantly correlated with urine t,t-MA concentration (r=0.733, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Hematologic parameters did not show significant difference among groups divided into the level of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Korean workers were not highly exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and the level of exposure was mostly less than 1 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, there might be an excessive risk of hematopoietic disorders due to relatively high past exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The OEL value of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was amended to 1 ppm from 10 ppm in 2002 and was effective since July 2003 </plain></SENT>
