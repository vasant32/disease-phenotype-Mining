<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative information regarding reliability of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> amplification methodologies applied to primary cells and representativeness of resulting gene expression profiles is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated four protocols for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> amplification from peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results obtained with 100 ng or 10 ng of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> amplified using two rounds of cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription were compared with control 2.5-microg <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples processed using a single round of in vitro transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable differences in results were obtained with different protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal protocol resulted in highly reproducible gene expression profiles from amplified samples (r = 0.98) and good correlation between amplified and control samples (r = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the optimal protocol dissimilarities of gene expression between mononuclear cells from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual and a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were primarily maintained after amplification compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that small variations in methodology introduce considerable distortion of gene expression profiles obtained after <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> amplification from clinical samples and too strong a focus on a very small number of genes picked from an array analysis could be unduly influenced by seemingly acceptable methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible to obtain reproducible and representative results using optimized protocols </plain></SENT>
