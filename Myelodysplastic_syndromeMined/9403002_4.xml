<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of the FMS gene occurs in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of FMS gene loss in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e>, 50 DNA samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 30 samples from haematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples were analysed using a quantitative Southern blotting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of one allele (hemizygous) was detected in five of 18 samples of AM-M4 and eight of 27 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M1, M2 and M3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, loss of both FMS alleles (homozygous) was demonstrated in three of 18 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4 and 0127 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M1, M2 and M3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M5 and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML M6</z:e> were assessed although no allelic loss of FMS was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> were also analysed and hemizygous loss was detected in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygous or hemizygous loss of FMS was not detected in any of 30 DNA samples isolated from haematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that loss of the FMS gene is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, with an increased frequency in those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtype M4 </plain></SENT>
