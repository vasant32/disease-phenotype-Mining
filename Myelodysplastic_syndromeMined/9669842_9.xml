<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bryostatin has shown promise both as a cytotoxic agent and more recently as a modulator of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi> (ara-C) resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound is currently in phase I and II trials as a single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay as a means of investigating the direct effects of bryostatin and the effects of co-incubating this agent with ara-C on fresh blast cells from 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional studies evaluated the levels of accumulation and retention of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) in cells exposed to ara-C with and without bryostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were exposed to bryostatin at a range of concentrations (0.1-100 nM) for 48 h and at 1 nM for both modulation studies and assessment of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found bryostatin to be cytotoxic in 18/58 (31%) tests whilst potentiation of formazan production in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was seen in 21/58 (36%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On co-incubation with bryostatin, 16/58 (27%) tests showed increased cytotoxicity to ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the accumulation of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> on co-incubation with bryostatin (p = 0.0401) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found patients with in vitro resistance were more likely to become sensitised following exposure to bryostatin (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study has emphasised the need to optimise treatment regimens for individual patients using this approach </plain></SENT>
