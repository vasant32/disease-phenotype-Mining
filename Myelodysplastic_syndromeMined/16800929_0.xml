<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of total ERK and phosphorylated-ERK were determined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of NaB in combination with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 on the proliferation/differentiation of SKM-1 cells was studied, and then the expression levels of the P21 and HDAC protein were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression level of phosphorylated ERK was down-regulated by the 1 mmol/L NaB, and the level of total ERK had not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NaB or combination of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 with NaB could increase the differentiation of the SKM-1 cells and up-regulated the levels of the P21 and HDAC protein, but the effect of combination of NaB with PD98059 was higher than that of NaB alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the inhibition of ERK may be involved in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> inducing differentiation in SKM-1 cells </plain></SENT>
