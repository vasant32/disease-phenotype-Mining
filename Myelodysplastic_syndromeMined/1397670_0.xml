<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 34 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 26 (76.5%) were found to have chromosome defects using an improved bone marrow culture method and high-resolution G-banding technique induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormalities varied among the subtypes: 1/2 in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts; 18/24 in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>; 5/6 in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>); and 2/2 in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities, either single, double or complex defects, were -5/5q-, -7, +8 and +21; 16q-/16p-, +19 and -X were also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of aneuploid cells, in particular hypodiploid cells, was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were detected more frequently in complex aberrations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of -5/5q- as a sole aberration was associated with longer mean survival time (greater than 18 months) but multiple (more than two) chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a poorer prognosis and a mean survival time of only 7.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome follow-up studies indicated that patients with -7, +8, +21, -X and complex defects, increased hypodiploid cells and karyotpic evolution were likely to have a high risk of transformation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or to a more severe subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a short overall mean survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These defects, mostly of the deleted type, are assumed to play a specific role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated chromosomal analyses during the clinical course convey more accurate prognostic criteria for patients </plain></SENT>
