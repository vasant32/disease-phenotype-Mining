<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic changes were first detected 1.8 to 6.5 years (mean, 3.9) after induction chemotherapy, and 0.5 to 3.1 years (mean, 1.4) after transplantation, and were characteristic of those reported for therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in 9 of the patients: abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 (classical-form) were present in 4, 11q23 or 21q22 abnormalities (topoisomerase II-related form) were detected in 3, and a combination of both forms was seen in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal 2p abnormalities were found in the 1 remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal karyotypes were associated with morphologically recognizable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 3 patients and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) arising in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient is still alive with cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 5 patients: 1 has died of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 have cytopenia, and 2 still have no morphologic or clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after short follow-up (4 and 13 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with a control group matched for disease, length of follow-up, and treatment with auto-BMT, there were no statistically significant associations between the development of clonal chromosomal abnormalities and age, number of chemotherapeutic regimens, prior local radiation, BMT conditioning regimen (with or without total body irradiation), or type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies show that the risk of developing clonal cytogenetic changes after auto-BMT for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is approximately 9% at 3 years, even when pre-BMT karyotypic studies are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
