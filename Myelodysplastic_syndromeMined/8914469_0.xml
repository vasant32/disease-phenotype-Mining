<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 51 years, 17 (13.2%) of them had antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and 9 (7.0%) had secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight patients (60.5%) were considered eligible for cure-oriented intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients were ineligible of one or more of the following; age over 70, antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the 129 patients was 441 days with an actuarial 5-year survival of 28.6 +/- 4.4%, and the disease-free survival (DFS) decreased with the increasing age of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 78 patients who were eligible for intensive chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved in 84.6% and overall DFS was 41.1 +/- 5.9% at 5 years, and their survival was longer than that of ineligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that considerable selection of patients, for example, due to old age, already existed before visiting our hospital </plain></SENT>
