<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Around 40-50% of patients show abnormal karyotypes that are mostly characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> or deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic findings are an independent prognostic factor and the International prognostic scoring system (IPSS) differentiates three cytogenetic categories, despite the Intermediate one being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study, including 421 Argentinean patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, is to characterize the cytogenetic profile, to test its prognostic value and to compare partial and monosomal karyotypes against other cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abnormal karyotype (median survival: 26 months) was observed in 176 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of complex karyotypes, number of alterations, and the IPSS cytogenetic groups showed significant differences for predicting outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavior of patients with isolated deletions (median survival: 49 months) did not differ from those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (56 months, P = 0.654) or Good prognostic findings (43 months, P = 0.371) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a worse prognosis was observed when another alteration was added (31 months, P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes with autosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> (median survival: 16 months) had a prognostic impact similar to other Poor cytogenetic findings (17 months, P = 0.626) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our population classified according to French-American-British (FAB) or World Health Organization (WHO), this new categorization of cytogenetic abnormalities, recognizing three different risk groups, showed an independent prognostic impact and a better discriminating power than the IPSS categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isolate deletions (excluding 7q-) are good prognostic findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> (excluding Y chromosome loss) are bad indicators </plain></SENT>
