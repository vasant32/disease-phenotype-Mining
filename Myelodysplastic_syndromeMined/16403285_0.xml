<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that many kinds of dysmegakaryocytes were observed in bone marrow smears of 4 cases, while in case A (PMF) and case D (M(6)) micromegakaryocytes were ripped apart; in case B (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and case C (M(2)) megakaryocytes were accompanied by nuclear extrusion or nucleocytoplasmic separation, and their bodies were large or giant, the part of nucleus separated from their body and little cytoplasm remained as micromegakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nucleocytoplasmic separation could be displayed by immunocytochemistry stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the phenomenon of nuclear extrusion and nucleocytoplasmic separation in megakaryocytes suggested the process that dispersed multinuclear releasing towards surround or even totally left the cell body during the megakaryocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also showed that the micromegakaryocytes may be the result of nucleocytoplasmic separation or splittings from multi-separated nucleus </plain></SENT>
