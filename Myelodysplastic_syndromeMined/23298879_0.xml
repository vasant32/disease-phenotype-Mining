<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for older patients (age â‰¥60 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), focusing on how to choose candidates for HSCT as well as data on the comparative effectiveness of RIC HSCT versus other treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: For some older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, there may be a survival advantage for RIC HSCT compared with nontransplantation approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health service approaches suggest that optimal treatment choice varies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For those with low/intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk, non-HSCT treatments may be preferred, but for intermediate-2/high IPSS patients, RIC HSCT may be better, even after adjusting for quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The optimal positioning of HSCT for older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Available data suggest that for older patients with higher risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, if their QoL is affected and they are medically fit, RIC HSCT may lead to more favourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective trials in older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are necessary to confirm the putative benefit of RIC HSCT </plain></SENT>
