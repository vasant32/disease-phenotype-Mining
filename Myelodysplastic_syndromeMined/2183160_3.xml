<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated N-ras genes with transforming ability have been detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and in human myeloid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR), differential oligonucleotide hybridization and direct DNA sequencing to retrospectively analyze the N-ras gene of blast cells from the same patient (a) at time of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, (b) after the patient had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of archival tissue samples served as a source of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different passages of the KG-1 myeloid cell line which had been established from leukemic blasts of this patient were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that native blast cells isolated at either of the two disease stages did not carry an N-ras mutation, and neither did early passage KG-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, direct DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA from <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice transformants induced by DNA from late passage of the KG-1 cell line revealed two linked mutations involving both the second nucleotide of codon 12 and the third nucleotide of codon 15 of N-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide substitution at codon 15 did not result in an amino acid substitution (silent mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutations probably occurred during prolonged passaging of the KG-1 cells and might have been overlooked by oligonucleotide hybridization assay </plain></SENT>
