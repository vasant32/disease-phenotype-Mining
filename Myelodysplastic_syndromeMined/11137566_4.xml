<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After diagnosis of a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> composed of relatively small cells, fludarabine was administered between May and October, 1997, to a 64-year-old female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In December 1998, a mild bicytopenia was present with a leukocyte count of 3800/microl and platelets of 142000/microl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The white cell differential count was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but MCV was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cytology revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellularity with dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining showed scattered positivity in early erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 20 mitoses, the karyotype showed complex rearrangements, described as 46,XX,t(4;11)(q23?24;q13),del(5q),del(7)(q22),+mar[8]/45,-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While there was no evidence of bone marrow infiltration by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CT scans demonstrated paraaortic lymph nodes up to 10 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After one course of CHOP chemotherapy, prolonged bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and septic complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was abandoned and Rituximab was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In July and November, 1999, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo>, respectively, were treated with antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NHL was in complete remission, but peripheral blood counts deteriorated markedly, and transfusions of packed red cells had to be started in November, 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The suspicion of leukemic transformation could not be confirmed because the patient declined further bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In December, 1999, the patient died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
