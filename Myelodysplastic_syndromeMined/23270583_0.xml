<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spliceosome gene mutations were detected in 40-80% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), particularly in those with ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, two large whole-genome sequencing studies identified mutations in the spliceosome gene SF3B1 in approximately 10% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrigued by these findings, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis and found that, unlike in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in CLL spliceosome mutations exist almost exclusively in SF3B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CLL with an SF3B1 gene mutation are characterized by a short progression-free survival and a low 10-year survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of SF3B1 mutations is significantly higher in chemotherapy treated than in untreated patients with CLL, suggesting that chemotherapy induces SF3B1 gene mutations or selects a population of mutated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether SF3B1 gene mutations have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, either because of altered splicing or other splicing-unrelated functions such as ectopic expression of Homeobox (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46904">Hox</z:chebi>) genes previously reported in SF3B1+(/-) mice, remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
