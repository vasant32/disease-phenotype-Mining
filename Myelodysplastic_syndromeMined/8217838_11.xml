<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients were treated with IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum TNF-alpha levels were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (14.2 +/- 2.4 pg/ml) compared to healthy controls (9.1 +/- 1.1 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During IL-3 therapy TNF-alpha levels remained unchanged in 3/14 patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet counts increased</z:e>, while in non-responders TNF-alpha levels increased 1.9-fold (P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that TNF-alpha not only is induced during IL-3 therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients but that this elevation might be associated with a poor platelet response to therapy </plain></SENT>
