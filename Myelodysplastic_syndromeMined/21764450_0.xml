<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete blood cell count (CBC) is a very important tool both for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate if it is possible to use the abnormal signals produced by dysplastic cells to produce a flag "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>" able to identify the patients needing further hematological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proposed flag has been tested in a large group of patients to evaluate the sensibility and specificity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that the flag "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>" is specific and sensible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
