<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 280 PNH cases referred to our hospital from January 1990 through June 2010 to assess clinical presentations, prognostic factors influencing survival, difference among subcategories, and clinical significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall survival at 10 years after diagnosis estimated by Kaplan-Meier was 77.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified risk factors affecting survival, including age &gt;40 years, absolute neutrophil count&lt;0.5 × 10(9) cells/L, development of thrombotic events, evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>recurrent infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort of patients were divided into subcategories of classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>/AA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-sc/AA based on the recent proposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> working clinical classification, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> as the initial symptomatic manifestation was high up to 82.0% in classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> subcategory, whereas only as low as 1.4% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-sc/AA subcategory; the frequencies of infectious (26.0%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> symptoms (14.0%) in classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> subcategory were significantly less than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>/AA (25.3% and 51.7%, respectively) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-sc/AA (48.3% and 83.2%, respectively) subcategories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that large <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone was associated with increased risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, whereas small <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
