<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with the mutation had a strikingly worse prognosis and the multivariate analysis demonstrated that this alteration was the most significant factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic comparison between patients with and without the mutation within each IPSS subgroup showed a significant difference in the intermediate subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of clinical manifestations and genetic configurations provided us with more accurate prognostic information in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
