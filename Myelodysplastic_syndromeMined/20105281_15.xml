<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel hEag1 (KV10.1) has been related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiological expression of the human channel is restricted to the brain but it is frequently and abundantly expressed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, thereby making it a promising target for a specific diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> has been described not to express hEag1, it has been assumed that the channel is not expressed in hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we show that this assumption is not correct, because the channel is up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and almost half of the tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> in a subtype-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, channel expression strongly correlated with increasing age, higher relapse rates and a significantly shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed hEag1 expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as an independent predictive factor for reduced disease-free and overall survival; such an association had not been reported before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a functional correlate, specific hEag1 blockade inhibited the proliferation and migration of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines and primary cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations implicate hEag1 as novel target for diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic approaches in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
