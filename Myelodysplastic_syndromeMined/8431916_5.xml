<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is of importance to deduce whether these deletions are actually terminal or interstitial because this has implications for their biologic consequences and the mechanism of their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal deletions have been observed in 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two or more deletions occurred in six cases, and in seven cases this was part of a complex abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 45 deletions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases analyzed, the deletions consistently were interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 cases, 16 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) [<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), three; RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) three; RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) eight; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) one; and unclassified, one], 11 cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), and 11 were other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> rubra vera (PRV) seven; essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (ET), three; unclassified, one] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, no uniformity of breakpoints could be identified other than del(9)(q13q22.2) most of which occurred with t(8;21) and del(20)(q11.2q13.3 or 13.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints corresponded to or were adjacent to fragile sites in 49% (proximal 64%, distal 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize that chromosomal deletions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> are interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The uniformity of breakpoints in del 9q and del 20q supports the concept that in some instances the exact breakpoints may be important through juxtaposition of genes rather than loss of critical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that there may be different mechanisms for the development of proximal and distal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
