<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had acquired idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (AISA), ten had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CMMoL), 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), nine had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>); three patients could not be subclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The actuarial median survival for patients with AISA or with RA had not been reached at 60 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival times for patients with CMMoL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> were 25, 21, and 16 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with each subtype who developed ANLL were none in AISA, 20% in CMMoL, 7% in RA, 56% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and 40% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CMMoL had a poor prognosis independent of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), whereas patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> had a high incidence of transformation and short survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were present in bone marrow cells from 19 patients at the time of diagnosis, and two others developed an abnormal karyotype at the time of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities, including initial and evolutionary changes, were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (9 patients), deletion of 5q (4 patients), and deletion of 20q (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival times were 32 months for patients with an abnormal karyotype, and 48 months for those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosomal abnormalities were not associated with particular histologic subtypes; however, a high percentage of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> had an abnormal clone (89% and 80%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with clonal abnormalities were 13% for AISA, 20% for CMMoL, and 29% for RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformed to ANLL in 42% of patients with an abnormal karyotype, compared to 10% of those with an initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients with RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, the risk of leukemic transformation was confined to those with an abnormal karyotype (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and karyotype combined were the best indicators of outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
