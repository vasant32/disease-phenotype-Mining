<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be difficult in cases with few dysplastic elements in BM and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the utility of flow cytometric analysis for the differential diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and non-clonal disorders (NCD) presenting peripheral cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative assessment of CD45, CD16, CD13, CD11b, CD10 and CD64 in granulocytes and monocytes, and CD71 and glycophorin A in erythroblasts besides CD34+ cell count was performed in BM of 31 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 11 patients with NCD and 11 healthy controls (BM donors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the median number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> found was 3 (1-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WPSS score showed a correlation with the total number of changes per case (r=0.48; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased SSC in promyelocytes correlated with the peripheral neutrophil count (r=-0.46; p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NCD, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation of antigen expression along granulocytic and erythroblast maturation was always maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the discriminant analysis, SSC of CD34+ cells, together with that of promyelocytes and metamyelocytes were able to correctly classify 87% of the cases as clonal or non-clonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our quantitative approach permitted to detect at least one abnormality in antigen expression in every case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the most important parameters for differential diagnosis with NCD were the analysis of the granularity in immature cells, especially of the granulocytic series </plain></SENT>
