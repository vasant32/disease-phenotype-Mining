<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Translocations and deletions of the short arm of chromosome 12 [t(12p) and del(12p)] are common recurring abnormalities in a broad spectrum of hematologic malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 20 patients and one cell line whose cells contained 12p13 translocations and/or 12p deletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with phage, plasmid, and cosmid probes that we previously mapped and ordered on 12p12-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis showed that the 12p13 translocation breakpoints were clustered between two cosmids, D12S133 and D12S142, in 11 of 12 patients and in one cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of 11 patients with deletions demonstrated that the deletions were interstitial rather than terminal and that the distal part of 12p12, including the GDI-D4 gene and D12S54 marker, was deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FISH analysis showed that cells from 3 of these patients contained both a del(12p) and a 12p13 translocation and that the affected regions of these rearrangements appeared to overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified three yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that span <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 12p13 translocation breakpoints mapped between D12S133 and D12S142 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They have inserts of human DNA between 1.39 and 1.67 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the region between D12S133 and D12S142 also represents the telomeric border of the smallest commonly deleted region of 12p, we also studied patients with a del(12p) using these YACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The smallest YAC, 964c10, was deleted in 8 of 9 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the other patient, the YAC labeled the del(12p) chromosome more weakly than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 12, suggesting that a part of the YAC was deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, most 12p13 translocation breakpoints were clustered within the sequences contained in the 1.39 Mb YAC and this YAC appears to include the telomeric border of the smallest commonly deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether the same gene is involved in both the translocations and deletions is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
