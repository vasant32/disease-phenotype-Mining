<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms which play a role in the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, however, are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a case of refractory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), and co-existing bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compact mast cell (MC) infiltrates were detected in bone marrow sections by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to tryptase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the MC were found to express c-kit, the tyrosine kinase receptor for MGF (mast cell growth factor = stem cell factor, SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activating point mutations in the kinase domain of c-kit (often found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>) were not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the mononuclear cells (MNC) of the bone marrow expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> specific for MITF, a transcription factor that regulates expression of c-kit and differentiation of MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the c-kit ligand SCF was found to augment expression of MITF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in bone marrow MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether this augmentation represents a general response (preventing loss of growth factor receptor expression during cell maturation) common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of hemopoietic progenitors, or is confined to (some forms of) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
