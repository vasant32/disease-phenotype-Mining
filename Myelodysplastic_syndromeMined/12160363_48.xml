<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Almost half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> that result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are due to cytopenia associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment is mostly supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with antithymocyte globulin improves cytopenia and reverses dependence on red blood cell transfusions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-treatment, prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Antithymocyte globulin, 40 mg/kg of body weight, given daily for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation of bone marrow, blood counts, transfusions, progression, and survival for a median of 30 months (range, 1 to 88 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 8 months of treatment, 21 of 61 patients (34%) no longer required red blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This independence from transfusions was maintained in 17 responders (81%) for a median of 36 months (range, 3 to 72 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of 21 patients (47.5%) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> had sustained platelet count increases, and 6 of 11 patients (55%) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> had sustained neutrophil counts of greater than 1 x 10(9) cells/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Characteristics favorable for response were younger patient age (P = 0.005) and lower platelet counts (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the 21 responders (5%) and 22 of the 40 nonresponders (55%) died before the end of the study (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the 21 responders (5%) and 13 of the 40 nonresponders (33%) had disease progression (P = 0.086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although this study was a nonrandomized, single-treatment study, 34% of patients treated with antithymocyte globulin became transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Response was associated with a statistically significant longer survival and an almost significant decreased time to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment with antithymocyte globulin did not seem to be detrimental because historical overall median survival times were similar to those of nonresponders </plain></SENT>
