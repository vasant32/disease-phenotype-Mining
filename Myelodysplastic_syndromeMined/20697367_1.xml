<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of chimerism analysis for prediction of relapse is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the clinical usefulness of mixed chimerism (MC) for predicting hematological relapse, 75 consecutively transplanted patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were analyzed with regard to lineage-specific chimerism, encompassing CD33(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB, n=49) and CD34(+) cells in BM (n= 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cutoff of 5% recipient cells was used to discriminate complete donor chimerism from MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 patients (25%) experienced hematological relapse after a median of 5 (1-31) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for detection of relapse was 59% for CD33(+) PB cells and 92% for CD34(+) BM cells with corresponding specificities of 91% and 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) BM cells were analyzed before relapse in seven patients, five of whom showed MC at a median of 2.5 (0.5-7) months before relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 8 of 18 patients showed MC involving CD33 PB with a median of one month (0.5-2) before relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide a model for early detection of relapse after SCT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in which serial characterization of both CD33(+) PB cells and CD34(+) BM cells gives an opportunity for early treatment before overt relapse </plain></SENT>
