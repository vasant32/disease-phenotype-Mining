<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), expression of the hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 has been associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD34 is usually analyzed by flow cytometry (FC), but may also be analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to compare these 2 methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow from 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and from 12 healthy young volunteers was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD34 was analyzed with FC on fresh bone marrow cells and with IH on sections of paraffin-embedded bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between FC and IH was good both for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with a high number of CD34-positive cells, the FC method seemed to result in a higher percentage of positive cells compared to the IH method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, the ratio between the percentage of CD34-positive cells and the percentage of bone marrow blasts was approximately 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the whole group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, this ratio was 1:1, while in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) it was 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> differed significantly from patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, who showed a ratio of only 0.23 (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the FC and IH methods for measuring expression of CD34 are well-correlated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and reasonably well correlated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A stem <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> is more commonly expressed on precursor cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
