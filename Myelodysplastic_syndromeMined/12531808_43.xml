<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of t-ML among children who had received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) following ALL remission induction therapy prompted us to examine this and other putative risk factors for t-ML in 412 children treated on 2 consecutive ALL protocols from 1991 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, 99 of whom received G-CSF; 284 also received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 58 of whom also received cranial irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 20 children who developed t-ML at a median of 2.3 years (range, 1.0-6.0 years), including 16 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratifying by protocol, the cumulative incidence functions differed (P =.017) according to the use of G-CSF and irradiation: 6-year cumulative incidence (standard error) of t-ML of 12.3% (5.3%) among the 44 children who received irradiation without G-CSF, 11.0% (3.5%) among the 85 children who received G-CSF but no irradiation, 7.1% (7.2%) among the 14 children who received irradiation plus G-CSF, and 2.7% (1.3%) among the 269 children who received neither irradiation nor G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even when children receiving irradiation were excluded, the incidence was still higher in those receiving G-CSF (P =.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the setting of intensive antileukemic therapy, short-term use of G-CSF may increase the risk of t-ML </plain></SENT>
