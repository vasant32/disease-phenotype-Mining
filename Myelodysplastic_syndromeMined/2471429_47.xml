<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the hematopoietic effects and toxicity of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The G-CSF was administered by daily subcutaneous injection to outpatients in a phase I-II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose was escalated every 2 weeks between 0.1 to 3.0 micrograms/kg body weight.d over an 8-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient clinical research center at a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twelve consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>: two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 10 of 12 patients, elevations in blood leukocyte counts (2- to 10-fold) and absolute neutrophil counts (5- to 40-fold) were seen over the 8-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of seven severely neutropenic patients (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L) had a rise in count to 1.2 to 16.3 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>Increased reticulocyte counts</z:hpo> occurred in 5 patients, and were associated with decreased transfusion requirements in 2 of 9 erythrocyte transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with G-CSF enhanced marrow myeloid cell maturation in 9 of 11 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis in vitro were improved or unchanged after treatment in 6 of 8 patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 patients, there were no substantial changes in platelet, lymphocyte, eosinophil, or monocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three responding patients initially had abnormal cytogenetics that persisted after G-CSF therapy, suggesting induced differentiation of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The therapy was associated with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the patients' conditions converted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> during treatment or in short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with G-CSF administered by subcutaneous injection is well tolerated and effective for improving the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and less commonly the transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, over 6 to 8 weeks in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
