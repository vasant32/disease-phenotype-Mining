<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to characterize bone marrow (BM) derived MSC from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using: kinetic studies, immunophenotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and genetic changes by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 36 cases of untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC achieved confluence at a significantly slower rate than donor-MSC, and the antigenic expression of CD105 and CD104 was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH studies showed DNA genomic changes that were proved not to be somatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To confirm that genomic changes were also present in freshly obtained MSCs they were enriched by sorting BM cells with the following phenotype: CD45(-)/CD73(++)/CD34(-)/CD271(++) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also showed genomic changes that were confirmed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To analyze the relationship of these aberrations with clinical-biological data an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed, two clusters were identified: the first one included the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> patients, whereas the other incorporated other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show, for the first time that MSC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> display genomic aberrations, assessed by array-CGH and FISH, some of them specially linked to a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtype, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
