<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of children with AA treated with IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of children with AA from 1984 to 2004, treated at our institution with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CS), and short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Forty-two patients were treated with IST (24 boys, 18 girls); of whom 26% received G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine, 19, and 12% were diagnosed with severe, very severe, and moderate AA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 53.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent had complete response; 19% had partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients relapsed and received a second course of ATG; both had a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 5 years survival rate was 67.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); both received long-term G-CSF and had partial response after two courses of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifteen percent of survivors had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which persisted after CS was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows promising response in children with AA treated with IST; however, the outcome was inferior to our institutional results with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up, larger cohorts, and prospective studies are warranted to evaluate late complications and risk factors </plain></SENT>
