<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present paper was to examine p53 mutation and immunostaining of the same patients, because there have been few reports of simultaneous analysis of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven p53 mutations were observed among 37 MDS and 11 cases of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-OL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutated p53 mainly observed in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had more intense p53 staining than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) produced no p53 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of p53 staining in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (71%) was higher than that of mutated p53 (11%) but did not reach 100% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases studied, therefore the authors attempted to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and AA, using a combination of p53 immunostaining, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> F (HbF) immunostaining and chromosome abnormality, because HbF of erythroblasts was reportedly observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> RA but not in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-OL (47/48) had at least one positive marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 11 AA cases, only two were positive for HbF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the combination of these three markers is useful to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from AA </plain></SENT>
