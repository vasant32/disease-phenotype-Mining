<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic importance of CRp before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 334) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n = 10) patients to determine the prognostic significance of achieving CR versus CRp before allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At time of transplantation, 266 patients were in CR (CR1 and ≥CR2) and 78 in CRp (CR1p and ≥CR2p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 38 months (3-131 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were most favorable in patients transplanted in CR (CR1 or ≥CR2) compared with CRp (CR1p or ≥CR2p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Achieving CR is therefore associated with improved posttransplantation outcomes compared with achieving CRp and is a significant prognostic factor that needs to be considered when evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients for clinical trials and allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
