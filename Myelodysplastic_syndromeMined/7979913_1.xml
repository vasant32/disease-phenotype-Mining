<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the utility of combining fluorescence in situ hybridization interphase cytogenetics with routine morphologic analysis to characterize cases for which signs and symptoms were suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in which dysplastic changes were insufficient for a definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hybridization with a chromosome 8-specific centromeric probe was performed on bone marrow smears that were obtained from four patients with cytogenetically documented <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and hematopoietic cell atypia that was suggestive but not diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signals that corresponded to <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 were detected in 14.6% to 32.2% of the cells (detection threshold of trisomic clone, 5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditions of two patients have remained hematologically stable with no disease progression, and these two patients are now considered to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conditions of the other two patients rapidly progressed to morphologically recognizable MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 by fluorescence in situ hybridization can provide useful supplemental information in bone marrow specimens with morphologic changes that are suggestive of but not sufficient for a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should prove to be useful when standard cytogenetic analysis has not been performed or when it is not readily available </plain></SENT>
