<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research on the epigenetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) mainly focused on the inactivation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes as a result of DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the basic molecular pathogenesis of epigenetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification may be controlled by Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins, which may give new clues toward understanding the epigenetic mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored for the first time the expression of PcG genes, including EZH2, EED, SUZ12, RING1, and BMI1, in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subsets and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), as well as the relationship between the expression of PcG genes and epigenetic alteration and prognosis-risk scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> showed overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes compared to their expression levels in patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with DNA methylation had higher EZH2 expression than those without DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment presented significantly reduced expression of EZH2 and RING1 besides decreased p15(INK4B) methylation after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 was always linked to poor prognostic scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, overexpression of the EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The products of these genes might participate in epigenetic regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies may also contribute to our understanding of the effective mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
