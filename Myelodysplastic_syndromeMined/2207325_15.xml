<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA-synthesis rates and concentrations of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) progenitor cells were studied in 22 patients treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL3) as part of a clinical phase I/II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant hIL3 at doses of 60 to 500 micrograms/m2 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection for 15 days to 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and preserved hematopoietic function and to nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, including five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA-synthesis rates of early and late granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells increased from 11% to 26% (CFU-GM day 14; P less than .02) and from 13% to 30% (CFU-GM day 7; P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014457" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eosinophil counts increased</z:e> significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or hematocrit, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet counts increased</z:e> by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
