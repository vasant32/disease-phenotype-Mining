<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean CFU-meg numbers were lower in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (10.7 +/- 11.4 and 42.3 +/- 58.5/10(5) BMLD cells) than in healthy controls (103.1 +/- 57.3/10(5) BMLD cells) (P &lt; 0.0001 and P= 0.0053, respectively), although they were distributed variably in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean TPO concentrations were higher in both AA (986.8 +/- 500.8 pg/ml) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (838.2 +/- 639.1 pg/ml) than in healthy controls (80.7 +/- 38.8 pg/ml) (P &lt; 0.0001), although they were distributed from high to low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients showed a slight elevation of TPO (123.1 +/- 55.3 pg/ml) P = 0.0106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TPO levels was inversely correlated to both platelet counts and CFU-meg numbers (correlative coefficient (CC): -0.719 and -0.682, P &lt; 0.0001) in AA, but not in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the inverse correlation to TPO was stronger in CFU-meg (CC: -0.678, P &lt; 0.0001) than in platelet counts (CC: -0.538, P = 0.0014), suggesting that CFU-meg plays an important role in regulating TPO production in this heterogenous disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CFU-meg and TPO may provide useful information for understanding thrombopoiesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially for application of TPO </plain></SENT>
