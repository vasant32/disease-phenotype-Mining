<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that changes in genes involved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) signaling pathway and the bone marrow stroma, suggesting that treatment with lenalidomide may help restore the damaged niche and suppress the TNF signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an effective treatment for patients with del(5q) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) The exact mechanism of lenalidomide function and its impact on the prognosis of patients is not known exactly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used gene expression profiling to study the effect of lenalidomide therapy in peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes of 6 patients with del(5q) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After lenalidomide treatment, genes involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) signaling pathway that were upregulated in the patients before treatment decreased to the healthy control baseline expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This change in gene expression, in conjunction with increased expression of repressed genes that affect the stem cell niche (ie, CXCR4 and CRTAP), may exert a positive effect on treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found that increased expression of the ARPC1B gene may have a negative impact on the stability of patient remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed changes in gene expression described here may contribute to the identification of pathways that are affected by lenalidomide, which may help to explain the effects of this drug </plain></SENT>
