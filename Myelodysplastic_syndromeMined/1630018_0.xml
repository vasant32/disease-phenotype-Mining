<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analysis of bone marrow smears from ten untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) revealed that seven patients had myelodysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> alone while the other two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The myelodysplastic changes seen in MM were less extensive than those seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the dysplastic changes in MM were determined to be limited to two or three lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic changes were observed even after clinical signs of MM had improved due to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We consider that the myelodysplastic changes seen in MM can be attributed to MM itself, rather than to the coexistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such findings suggest that the pathogenesis of MM involves a common stem cell which differentiates into multiple lineage cells </plain></SENT>
