<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired neutrophil function has often been reported in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), but its laboratory features have not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity has been evaluated with a microscopic method by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> salt reduction to blue-black insoluble formazan granules identified in positive neutrophils by microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated neutrophil <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase in 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (cMPDs) and 15 patients with MDSs, using the microscopic method as well as a photometric microplate assay, which monitored the cytochemical reaction for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between cMPD and patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the photometric assay, the mean enzyme activity in MDSs and cMPDs was lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity was greater in cMPDs (except <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>) than in MDSs (except <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), and these differences were less evident with microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for cMPDs, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infections</z:hpo> showed a lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
