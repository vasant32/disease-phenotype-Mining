<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered 5 micrograms/m2 daily by subcutaneous injection to 29 such patients increasing the dose in patients who did not show a haematologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doses of 5 or 10 micrograms/m2 ('low-dose GM-CSF') produced an increase in neutrophils in 14/29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response was significantly (P = 0.03) more frequent in patients who had a higher pre-treatment neutrophil count (e.g. 11/16 in patients with greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rise in blasts followed administration of low-dose GM-CSF in five patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with either refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEBT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelets decreased in five patients, four of whom had no change in blasts, reverting to baseline when GM-CSF was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We and others have previously observed similar rises in blasts or decreases in platelets at doses of 120 micrograms/m2 daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-dose GM-CSF produced no constitutional side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that low doses of GM-CSF might be initially employed in neutropenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> who present with pretreatment neutrophil counts greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing the dose, and hence the risk of extramedullary toxicity, only in patients who do not respond to the low dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who present with lower pre-treatment neutrophil counts might begin treatment at doses above 10 micrograms/m2, but below the 120 micrograms/m2 commonly employed, which may be necessary in relatively few patients </plain></SENT>
