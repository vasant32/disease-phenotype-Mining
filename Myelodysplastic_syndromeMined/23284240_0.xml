<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One aim of treatment is to maintain the blood-cell count to near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is mainly achieved with hematopoietic- growth factors and transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine the cost of supportive treatment/care for patients with low and intermediate I risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in respect to private healthcare plans in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We adapted the National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network treatment guidelines for intermediate risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients to the Brazilian reality, adopting a decision tree to explore treatment combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we calculated the costs for each branch of the tree, according to national prices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also estimated total costs for a cohort of 100 patients, distributed across treatment combinations according to the expected epidemiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assumed a horizon of one year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment for low and intermediate I risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is US$ 42,758/patient/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cost can vary from US$ 24,282 to US$ 121,952, according to patient characteristics and the treatment used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients that require immunotherapy with antithymocyte globulins are associated with the highest cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those that achieve disease stability solely with the use of erythropoietin were associated with the lowest cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Brazil, treatment of low and intermediate I risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is associated with a mean cost of the order of US$ 42,700/patient/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>New types of therapy have the potential to change this scenario if they can diminish the requirements for supportive care </plain></SENT>
