<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta1 protein, located in codon 10 in exon 1 and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the progression of the disease among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> belonging to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 50) was based on the FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha genotypes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP and the TGF-beta genotypes were analyzed using an amplification refractory mutation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with RA showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TT homozygosity at codon 10 of TGF-beta1 was significantly higher among patients with bi- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (severe group) than in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> only (mild group; odds ratio = 6.99, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism in codon 10 and the -308 TNF-alpha gene polymorphism do not predispose to the development of RA, but the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism may affect disease progression </plain></SENT>
