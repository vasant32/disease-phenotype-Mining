<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution SNP microarrays, we studied a total of 517 MPN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients in different disease stages, including 77 AML cases with previous history of MPN (N = 46) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (N = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequent chromosomal deletions of variable sizes were detected, allowing the mapping of putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes involved in the leukemic transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected frequent deletions on the short arm of chromosome 6 (del6p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common deleted region on 6p mapped to a 1.1-Mb region and contained only the JARID2 gene--member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we compared the frequency of del6p between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and leukemic phase, we observed a strong association of del6p with leukemic transformation (P = 0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, analysis of deletion profiles of other PRC2 members revealed frequent losses of genes such as EZH2, AEBP2, and SUZ12; however, the deletions targeting these genes were large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also identified two patients with homozygous losses of JARID2 and AEBP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed frequent codeletion of AEBP2 and ETV6, and similarly, SUZ12 and NF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using next generation exome sequencing of 40 patients, we identified only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the PRC2 complex member SUZ12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the frequency of point mutations in PRC2 members was found to be low, deletions were the main type of lesions targeting PRC2 complex members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests an essential role of the PRC2 complex in the leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
