<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of a primary translocation in the development of collaborating mutations is debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To delineate the role of leukemic translocation NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) in secondary mutagenesis, DNA break and repair mechanisms in stimulated mouse B lymphocytes expressing NHD13 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed significantly reduced expression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair genes, DNA Pkcs, DNA ligase4, and Xrcc4 leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that expression of NHD13 fusion gene resulted in impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA break repair </plain></SENT>
