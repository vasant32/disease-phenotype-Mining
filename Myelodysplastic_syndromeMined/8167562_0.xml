<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dose was continued in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dose response of CFU-E and BFU-E to Epo was analysed at the entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination with an in vitro study of hematopoietic progenitors was performed before and after the first three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of 20 patients responded: a total recovery was observed in 3 patients; one became transfusion independent and a reduction of 50% of the transfusion requirement was achieved in 3 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 patients are still receiving treatment for 2, 3 and 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between the in vitro and clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A non parametric analysis of responders and non responders emphasised the importance of a long delay between the diagnosis and the treatment, (p = 0.024) and an endogenous Epo level less than 100 mU/ml (p = 0.025) in order to predict the efficacy of rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study offers evidence that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemias</z:hpo> without excess of blasts in the bone marrow respond to rhEpo at pharmacological doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are required in order to define the patients who may respond and to elucidate the mechanism of the positive effect of rhEpo </plain></SENT>
