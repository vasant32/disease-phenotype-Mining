<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, not much is known about PTLD following the more recently introduced nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NMST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports the findings from two cases of PTLD following NMST and compares them to the one previously reported case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donor origin of the PTLD was determined using short tandem repeat analysis, and B- and T-cell clonalities were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases of PTLD evolved in a total of 70 patients who have undergone NMST at our institution from 1999 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients received conditioning with Fludarabine/Cytoxan/Campath 1H (alemtuzumab, anti-CD52 antibody) and T-cell-depleted donor cells with Campath-1H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both PTLDs were EBV positive (by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization) with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate the incidence of PTLD following NMST is 3% (2 of 70 patients from our institution and 1 of 30 from the previously reported case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three PTLDs arose 6 to 7 months after NMST and were rapidly fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathology of the PTLD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was donor origin, EBV positive, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
