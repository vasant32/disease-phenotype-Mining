<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed that RER of CHED in the patients (2.69 +/- 0.76) was significantly higher than that in controls (1.12 +/- 0.51, P &lt; 0.01), the RER out of 85.7% of the patients was higher than the mean value of the controls, in which three patients developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; the RER out of 61.9% of the patients was higher than the upper limit of the mean value of the controls; three patients whose RER was lower than the mean value of the controls did not developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the expression of CHED gene in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
