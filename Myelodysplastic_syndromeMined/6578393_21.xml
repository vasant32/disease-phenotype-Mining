<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several agents, including arabinosyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> (ARA-C) at a low concentration, can induce leukemic myeloblasts to mature to a variable extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic implications of this observation are worth investigating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few case-reports have shown that low dose ARA-C can be useful for treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no information is available yet on the proportion of patients who can be expected to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We treated by low dose ARA-C (20-30 mg/sqm/day i.v. or i.m. for 7-10 days) 20 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A complete remission of 5 months was obtained in one of nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (SAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A partial remission (complete normalization of blood counts with a slight excess of marrow blast cells) was obtained twice in one of 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase of Hb level (more than 11.5 g/dl) was obtained and maintained for 12 months in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A short-lasting increase of granulocyte count was obtained in another two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and SAML respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that low dose ARA-C can advantageously modify the proliferation to maturation imbalance of leukemic cells by slowing down cell proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of patients who respond is probably low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This treatment is at a very early experimental stage and should be probably limited to selected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
