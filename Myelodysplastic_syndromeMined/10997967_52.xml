<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relatively short follow-up (median 27 months) did not enable the evaluation of the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the long-term outcome of the 114 patients included in the trial: 56 patients randomized to receive HU and 58 patients to receive no cytoreductive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before randomization, 15 patients had been treated with busulphan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the observation period, 29 patients (50%) shifted from the control to the HU group mainly because of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 73 months (range 3-94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat and, when indicated, by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When analysed by intention to treat, 46 out of 54 patients (85%) originally randomized in the HU group are alive, compared with 49 of 58 patients (84%) in the control group [not significant (n.s.)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9%) in the HU group and 26 patients (45%) in the control group had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study showed that: (a) HU reduced the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in ET patients; (b) the sequential use of busulphan and HU significantly increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e>; and (c) overall survival was not affected by HU therapy </plain></SENT>
