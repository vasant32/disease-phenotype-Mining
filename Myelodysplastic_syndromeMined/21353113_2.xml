<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell transfusions--a conventional treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>--have been associated with high costs and decreased quality of life compared with transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase III clinical trial data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> may offer an improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-free survival versus best supportive care (BSC), which consists of red blood cell transfusions, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, platelet transfusions, and colony-stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a 5-day outpatient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> dosing regimen, which might reduce administration costs compared with the standard 3-day inpatient regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5-day dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus BSC in US patients with intermediate- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from a US payer perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov model with 3 health states (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was constructed to simulate natural disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model followed patients in 4-week cycles for â‰¤ 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical inputs and patient characteristics were based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> Phase III clinical trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Costs of supportive care and adverse events were based on trial resource utilization data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drug and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> costs were obtained from published sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of model parameters on results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the base-case model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> yielded 0.276 additional year of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-free survival and 0.052 more quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with BSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and administration costs over the 5-year time horizon were $28,933 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total direct medical costs were $122,940 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> arm and $122,666 in the BSC arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> versus BSC was $5277 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> had a higher probability than BSC of being cost-effective despite the uncertainty around some model parameters, including survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> administered on a 5-day dosing schedule was likely a cost-effective treatment option in patients with intermediate- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from a US payer perspective </plain></SENT>
