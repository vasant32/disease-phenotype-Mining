<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a clinical experience of continuous intra-arterial blood gas monitoring (PARATREND 7:P 7) during bronchopulmonary lavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 47-year-old, 86-kg male was suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bronchopulmonary lavage was scheduled to alleviate the symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P 7 and a continuous cardiac output monitor were used with an EKG monitor, a pulse oximeter, and a esophageal stethoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was maintained using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's trachea was intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube (39-F Broncho-cath; Mallinckrodt, Ireland) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After denitrogenation and degassing, warmed isotonic saline was infused into his left lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume chosen was 2,200 ml which approximated the sum of the patient's functional residual capacity and tidal volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lowest point of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> appeared at the point 'degassed' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P 7 showed a consecutive rise of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> associated with infusion of large volume of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the response to change in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> of P 7 is slower than pulse oximeter, frequent blood sampling can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We think that P 7 with pulse oximeter are useful for the safe management of pulmonary lung lavage </plain></SENT>
