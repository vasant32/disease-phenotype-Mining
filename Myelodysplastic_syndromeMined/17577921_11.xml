<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro differentiation model of human hematopoiesis, we generated defined differentiation stages (day 0, day 4, day 7, day 11) of erythro-, thrombo- and granulopoiesis from 13 MDS patients and seven healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding gene expression was analyzed by microarray (Affymetrix, HG-U133A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that p16, survivin, CHK2, and WT1 are affected by promotor hypermethylation in MDSs displaying a selective International Prognostic Scoring System risk association </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified a suppressed survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in methylated samples during erythropoiesis, whereas WT1 and CHK2 methylation-related reduction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was found during granulopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk types </plain></SENT>
