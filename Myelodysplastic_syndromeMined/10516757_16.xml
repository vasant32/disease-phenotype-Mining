<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 53 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, by using single-step DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis and then by separating fresh marrow mononuclear cells in CD34+ and CD34- populations and in situ single cell evaluation of the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes, in total and separated mononuclear marrow cells and correlated the findings with clinical and laboratory characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> had increased marrow cellularity, longer overall survival and a longer period for transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 'good' prognosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, total mononuclear marrow cells, as well as isolated populations of CD34+ and CD34- cells showed significant degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; in 'poor' prognosis cases, however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was evident only in a large percentage of CD34+ marrow cells and not in total or CD34- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of expression of both c-myc and p53 in total marrow cells was associated with significant degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and in isolated CD34+ and CD34- marrow cells the phenomenon was inversely correlated with the level of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is detected in both CD34+ and CD34- cells in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and seems to be restricted to CD34+ cells in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
