<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most widely used technique for determining clonality based on X-chromosome inactivation is the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reliability of this assay depends critically on the digestion of DNA before PCR with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel method for quantitatively monitoring the HpaII digestion in individual samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using real-time quantitative PCR we measured the efficiency of HpaII digestion by measuring the amplification of a gene that escapes X-chromosome inactivation (XE169) before and after digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method was tested in blood samples from 30 individuals: 2 healthy donors and 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a lack of XE169 DNA reduction after digestion in the granulocytes of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients leading to a false polyclonal X-chromosome inactivation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other samples a significant reduction of XE169 DNA was observed after HpaII digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median reduction was 220-fold, ranging from a 9.0-fold to a 57,000-fold reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also paraffin-embedded malignant tissue was investigated from two samples of patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two samples of patients with colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three of these cases inefficient HpaII digestion led to inaccurate X-chromosome inactivation pattern ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that monitoring the efficiency of the HpaII digestion in a human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene PCR setting is both necessary and feasible </plain></SENT>
