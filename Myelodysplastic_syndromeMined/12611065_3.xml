<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) after allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is important to schedule therapeutic intervention, e.g. donor lymphocyte infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We asked, whether chimerism analysis in circulating CD34+ cells might be a feasible method to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in patients after allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients undergoing allogeneic SCT were prospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cells were prepared from peripheral blood samples and sorted after immunomagnetic preenrichment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated to overall chimerism and results of nested RT-PCR for the bcr-abl rearrangement in Ph1-cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 87 patients a median of 8 analyses (range 2-22) covering a median period of 295 days (range 28-1152) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A hematological relapse was observed in 22/84 engrafting patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In twenty patients, the relapse was detected in the CD34+ fraction, in 14 of these patients, donor chimerism in CD34+ cells decreased 12-97 days (median 52 days) before the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases, CD34+ chimerism failed to demonstrate the relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with relapsing <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, the decrease of donor CD34+ cells was associated with reappearance of bcr-abl transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment (reduction of immunosuppression, DLI or STI571) was associated with an increase of donor derived CD34+ cells and clearance of bcr-abl positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sequential chimerism analysis in CD34+ cells is feasible and sensitive, allowing early detection of relapse and monitoring of therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This method appears especially useful in patients with high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lacking other markers for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
