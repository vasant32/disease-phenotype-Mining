<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Current treatment of the Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> family of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (ESFT) includes intensive multiagent chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This treatment approach has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are distinctive features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, the authors evaluated a cohort of patients treated for ESFT to determine the degree and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and their relation with the development of therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 73 patients with ESFT treated on two consecutive protocols (EW92 and EW87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both chemotherapy regimens incorporated the same agents but differed in cumulative drug dose, dose per course, and the use of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes were determined at diagnosis and during follow-up visits after completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the EW92 group had significantly greater MCVs after treatment than did the less intensively treated EW87 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes persisted throughout the 40-month observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the EW92 group also had lesser mean platelet counts after treatment than those in the EW87 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCV differences (from baseline) were inversely related to platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was 7.8%+/-4.7% at 4 years in the EW92 group and zero in the EW87 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients treated for ESFT with intensive chemotherapy that includes large doses of alkylators, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, and G-CSF characteristically have persistently elevated MCVs and decreased platelet counts after completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These hematologic abnormalities may represent stem cell damage, predisposing patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, but further study is needed to establish this relation </plain></SENT>
