<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It encodes an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRAME is a good candidate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunotherapy and is a useful marker gene for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, PRAME <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> using real-time RT-PCR was studied in 74 adult cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>-68 had de-novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-blastic crisis (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BC), and 3 had myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome-blastic transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>-BT)-and the results were compared with 30 age-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 74 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> expressed PRAME, while only 2 controls showed weak expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of PRAME expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL cases was 30% and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not find any important correlation between PRAME expression and clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, organomegaly/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, Hb, WBC count, platelet count, LDH level, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, cell-surface antigens, response to therapy, or progression-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRAME was monitored in 15 cases during remission and/or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between PRAME <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and hematological remission and/or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PRAME was very high in one case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> but was not found 3 months after allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PRAME <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is observed in about one-third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases; it may be a useful marker to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, and it may also be a good predictor for the timing of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in the post-transplant period in cases of molecular relapse </plain></SENT>
