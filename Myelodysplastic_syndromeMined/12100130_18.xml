<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immune reconstitution was studied prospectively in 66 children who underwent 77 haematopoietic cell transplantations (HCT): 46 autologous HCTs in 39 patients and 31 allogeneic HCTs in 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the dynamic analysis of immune recovery with regard to potential factors affecting its speed, including age, type of HCT, diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absolute counts of different lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin serum levels were determined in peripheral blood of patients on d -7 and +16, and then at various intervals up to 24 months post transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common patterns of immune recovery after both allogeneic and autologous HCT were identified: (i) CD4+CD45RO+ peripheral T-cell expansion on d +16; (ii) inverted CD4+:CD8+ ratio from d +30 onwards; (iii) rapid natural killer (NK) cell (CD16+/-CD56+) count normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed prolonged T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+) until 24 months after autologous HCT, whereas in the allogeneic setting CD3+CD4+ cells, including naive CD45RA+ cells, returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values at 9 months post transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; 10 years and coexistence of GvHD and CMV reactivation were associated with a substantial delay in T- (CD4+, including CD45RA+) and B-cell recovery after allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multidrug GvHD prophylaxis resulted in impaired T- (CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+) and B-cell reconstitution only in the early phase after allogeneic HCT (up to 4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that T-cell recovery was severely impaired in children after autologous HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be emphasized that specific approaches to enhance immune reconstitution are necessary to control <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and avoid the risk of infectious complications in the autologous setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> after allogeneic HCT seems to be associated with age and coexistence of GvHD and CMV reactivation </plain></SENT>
