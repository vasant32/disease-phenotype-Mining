<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of pluripotent stem cells and progenitor cells has not been clarified conclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of blood and bone marrow (BM) smears for mature cells and FISH of cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH showed +8 in granulocytes, monocytes, and erythroblasts, but not in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sorted cells of T (CD3(+)), B (CD19(+)), and NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+)) from peripheral blood did not contain +8, nor did CD34(+) subpopulations from BM including B (CD34(+)CD19(+)), T/NK (CD34(+)CD7(+)) progenitors, and pluripotent stem cells (CD34(+)Thy1(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The +8 chromosome abnormality was identified in stem cells only at the level of colony-forming unit of granulocyte-erythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM; CD34(+)CD33(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may thus be concluded that cells affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are at the CFU-GEMM level and that cells of lymphoid lineage are not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide new insights into the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and suggest that intensive chemotherapy and autologous BM transplantation may become important therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
