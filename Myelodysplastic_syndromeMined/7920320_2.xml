<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of 118 patients had graft failure (2.5%; (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7%, 6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Graft failure was high in patients &lt; or = 15 years with 3 of 12 patients with failure (25.0%) compared with 0 of 106 patients &gt; 15 years (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Failure to engraft was not seen in HLA-identical (related or unrelated) donor transplants (0 of 103) whereas 3 of 15 HLA-mismatched donors failed (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient diagnosis, locus of HLA-mismatch, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in the preparative regimen, marrow cell dose and the relative reactive index (RRI) were not significant factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> kinetics secondary to young age was probably not a major factor since 8 of 8 HLA-identical donor transplants engrafted in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that patients receiving an unmanipulated marrow graft using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-containing regimens were at a high risk for graft failure only if they were &lt; or = 15 years of age and had an HLA-mismatched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More immunosuppressive preparative regimens, possibly including total body irradiation, should be considered to prevent potential graft failure in children </plain></SENT>
