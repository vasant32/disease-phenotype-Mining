<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of this condition is still unclear, it is not uncommon in the elderly, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, and a variety of transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a 17-year-old male patient with transfusion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He received transfusion of a total of 345 units of blood in a period of 18 months but without iron chelating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressive fatty replacement of the pancreas parenchyma was found by a series of computed tomography images over seven hospital admissions due to repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy revealed hemosiderin deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of his poor response to induction chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation was suggested, but the patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> before the therapeutic procedure could take place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although most patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003338'>pancreatic lipomatosis</z:mp> have neither clinical symptoms nor abnormal laboratory data, it may cause <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and exocrine pancreas dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this reported case, mild exocrine dysfunction was noted on the last admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be cautious of hemosiderin deposition after large amount of blood transfusion and chelating therapy should be given to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
