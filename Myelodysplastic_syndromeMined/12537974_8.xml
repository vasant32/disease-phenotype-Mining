<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prognostic impact of WHO classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was studied in a group of 103 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) according to French-American-British (FAB) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median survival of 37 patients with RA according to WHO criteria of 85.2 months was significantly different from that in both 37 patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) (47.0 months, P=0.002) and 29 patients with 5q- abnormality diagnosed by routine chromosome banding (36.2 months, P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more detailed karyotype analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques confirmed 5q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality in only 12 out of 29 patients, in 4 patients 5q- was associated with complex abnormalities involving 5q region, 13 patients had 5q deletion combined with further karyotype abberations outside 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference in median survival and estimated 3 years survival was observed between RA patients, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> according to WHO <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> criteria and patients with 5q- as a single abnormality confirmed by FISH in contrast to patients with either additional 5q abberations or further karyotype changes not involving 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same difference was also observed in time to 25% of patients evolving to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed usefulness of separation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> from RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> represents a poor prognostic subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clearly distinct from pure RA mainly due to short survival connected with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and increased risk of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also suggest to define <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> of FAB type RA with 5q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality confirmed by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This definition enabled us to discriminate 5q- patients with favorable prognosis similar as in RA from those with poor outcome associated with 5q- combined with complex abnormalities involving either 5q or regions outside 5q </plain></SENT>
