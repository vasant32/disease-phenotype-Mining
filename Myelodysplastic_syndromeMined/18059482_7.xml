<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) increased chromosomal breaks point toward defects in DNA repair machinery including base excision repair (BER) pathway involved in handling of oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether defects in this pathway can be found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> (8-OG) were found in a significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, indicating increased oxidative DNA damage or defective handling of oxidative load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a distinct subgroup of patients, increased 8-OG content was associated with increased hOGG1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some patients, increased numbers of abasic sites (AP sites) correlated with low levels of POLbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the nature of this defect, we examined genetic lesions potentially explaining accumulation of 8-OG and AP sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We genotyped a large cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and found a correlation between increased oxidative damage and the presence of the hOGG1-Cys326 allele suggesting inadequate compensatory feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, this hOGG1 variant was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in advanced forms, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrated that BER dysfunction in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients may be responsible for the increased 8-OG incorporation and explains one aspect of the propensity to chromosomal breaks in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but other mechanisms may also be involved </plain></SENT>
