<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common acquired chromosomal aberrations in FA patients are <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 1q and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of chromosome 7; the latter is known to be associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few reports also suggest that gains of 3q are associated with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and overall poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not uncommon for patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> to have easily detectable (oligoclonal) chromosomal alterations in their still <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (nonmalignant) marrow, which makes it even more challenging to determine the import of such alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for gains in 1q and 3q and for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and 7q deletions on 212 bone marrow samples from 77 children with FA treated at our institution between 1987 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the baseline increased <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and defective DNA repair in patients with FA, which leads to unbalanced chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, insertions, and translocations, for the purpose of this analysis an abnormal clone was defined as â‰¥10% abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 3 and 7 aberrations were associated with increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.019 and P &lt; 0.001 respectively), although the significance of chromosome 3 aberrations disappeared when different observation times were accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gain of 1q alone did not predict development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, children with FA should be followed closely with FISH analyses, because some of the clonal chromosomal abnormalities may be early indicators of progression toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and thus also of the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
