<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA may improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A surveillance strategy was evaluated for detection of AdV DNA by PCR in a prospective study of unselected allogeneic HSCT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel with a routine CMV surveillance program, plasma from 20 children and 77 adults was analyzed by quantitative PCR for detection of AdV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in 12 unselected patients, the presence of AdV-specific T cells were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) at 1 to 3 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 5 of 97 (5%) patients had detectable AdV DNA in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had high titers and none developed AdV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BM as a source of stem cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> as the indication for transplantation were independently associated with higher risk of acquiring AdV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AdV-specific T cells were detected in 7 (58%) of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although AdV DNA was found in peripheral blood by quantitative PCR in 5% of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, the present surveillance program did not have a significant effect on the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
