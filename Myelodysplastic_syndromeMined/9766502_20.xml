<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked expansion of CD57+ cells among circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes was frequently detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> of B cell origin (B-CLL, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) but not in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, suggesting a causal relation with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>'s major histocompatibility complex class II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunomagnetic separation techniques, we further demonstrate that the patients' CD57+/CD28- T cells display a typical Th1-type cytokine secretion profile upon anti-CD3 stimulation, with a markedly higher secretion of the Th1-type cytokines IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha than their CD57-/CD28+ counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic activity of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes, measured ex vivo in an anti-CD3-redirected assay, was almost exclusively exerted by the CD57+/CD28- subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a marked cytotoxic activity was detected within CD4+CD57+ T cells from some B-CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the patients' CD57+/CD28- T cells displayed an increased tendency to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results indicate that the expanded CD57+/CD28- T cells in hemato-oncological patients represent differentiated effector cells, similar to their (quantitatively minor) counterpart in healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for their expansion and their pathophysiologic significance, however, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
