<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between evolution of karyotype and clinical progress in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and estimate the clinical outcomes of high risk patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous karyotyping were performed using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and G-banding technique to follow up 41 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Karyotype analysis showed that 24 cases (58.5%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a median follow up of 34 months (7 approximately 72 months), 6 cases had karyotype evolution in 12 cases with clinical deterioration, while only one had karyotype evolution in 18 cases without clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The involved chromosomes included No. 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six out of 7 patients who received allo-HSCT attained complete remission and their abnormal karyotypes returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients with clinical remission after therapy attained cytogenetic remission too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Karyotype evolution showed a strong relationship with clinical progress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and indicated a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical progress had much higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> than those with relatively stable clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Allo-HSCT should be considered the first choice of therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with clonal karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
