<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HFE genotyping results were also evaluated in view of the clinical data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>49 patients with MM were compared to 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) concerning the incidence of two genetic variants of the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) identified with PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data of serum iron, transferrin saturation, consumed blood units and initial white blood cell counts (WBC) were analysed in relation to the HFE genotype status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>30 out of the 61 MDS patients (49%) and only 9 out of the 49 MM patients (20%) were positive for either HFE variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum iron and transferrin saturation levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in MM and elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial WBC were significantly lower in the minority of MM patients who were at the same time heterozygous for the HFE gene variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found significant differences in the frequencies of the HFE genetic variants between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MM patients with strong correlation to their iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low WBC in HFE positive MM patients unrelated to bone marrow infiltration rate might raise the suspicion of co-existent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
