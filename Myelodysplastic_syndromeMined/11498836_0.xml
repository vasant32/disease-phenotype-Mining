<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surface markers of mononuclear marrow cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for a panel of monoclonal antibodies in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of myeloid antigen increased significantly while lymphoid antigen decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigen expression was correlated with the FAB subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, Immature myeloid cells (CD13+, CD33+) was being increased and the lymphoid antigen expression decreased with the RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> evolving to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, the number of CD34+ cells was not significantly different in RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> subtypes but significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of early marrow cell antigens (CD38, HLA-DR, CD99R and CD9) was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD34 and other early antigen was predictive for transformation and poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surface marker analysis of mononuclear marrow cells may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
