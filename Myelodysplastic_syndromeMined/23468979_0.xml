<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is commonly found in young individuals (&lt;60 years) in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reason for the high incidence in younger individuals is still unclear, and the differences in disease features between young and elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been not well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore these issues, in this study, we analyzed the clinical and experimental characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the patients younger and older than 60 years old and characterized the potential age-associated differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that over half of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (61.9%) were younger than 60 years old upon the first diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The younger patients were more likely to be female, who have lower risk and less advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> were more frequent in the younger patients than the older ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The marrow CD34+ cells in the younger patients showed lower proliferation and higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in comparison with that in the older ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Obvious amplification of T cells and low CFU formation could be found in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CFU formation was significantly increased in the younger patients after the removal of activated T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the younger patients had a lower frequency of p15(INK4B) methylation, longer survival expectancy and less <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, the younger patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in China may show more benign disease features than the older ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enhanced immunological response may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the patients younger than 60 years </plain></SENT>
