<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG regimen) has been reported to be effective in patients with these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients (32 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and 10 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) were treated with the FLAG regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 61 years (range, 27-74 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty patients were diagnosed with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 2 patients had treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy was comprised of the FLAG regimen, whereas consolidation therapy included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a compatible donor and who were age &lt; 50 years were scheduled to undergo an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), whereas for those patients without a donor and who were age &lt; 60 years autologous BMT with peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by the consolidation regimen plus G-CSF was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 31 of 42 patients (74%; 95% confidence interval, 60-87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> during induction therapy occurred in 4 patients (9%) whereas 7 patients (17%) were resistant to the FLAG regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity from the consolidation regimen was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients age &lt; 50 years and achieving CR were eligible for allogeneic BMT procedures, with early recurrence being the only reason for exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival and disease free survival were 13 months and 18 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with favorable cytogenetics had a significantly better outcome compared with those patients with an adverse karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FLAG regimen is effective in patients with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as in patients age &gt; 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of the regimen is low and the majority of patients are eligible to undergo allogeneic BMT procedures after induction/consolidation therapy </plain></SENT>
