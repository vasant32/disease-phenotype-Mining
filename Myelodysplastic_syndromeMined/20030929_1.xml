<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical data of 65 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were reviewed and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to FAB criteria, 65 patients were classified as follows: 27 patients with RA, 1 patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, and 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of them was 66 years old (range 19-89 years), and 6 patients had a history of toxic exposure (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow smears, bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic examinations were performed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 64 patients examined with bone marrow smears (98.5%), among them trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 21 patients (32.3%), bilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 33 patients (50.8%), only erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 8 cases (12.3%) and 2 patients (3.1%) only with myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow biopsy was performed in 38 patients, abnormal localization of immature precursor (ALIP) occurred in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>29 patients had abnormal karyotypes, accounting for 59.2% of the 49 patients subjected cytogenetic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abnormal chromosome was the major cytogenetic abnormality, which occurred more often in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e> and the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 49 patients who had received cytogenetic examination, 15 patients transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with the incidence of 30.61%, but only 3 out of 20 patients in the group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (15%), while 12 out of 29 patients in the group of abnormal karyotypes transformed into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (41.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time of following up was 35 months (range 2 - 106 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 26.8 months and 8 months in the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and chromosome aberrations respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in our country is younger than that in Western countries, the rate of abnormal chromosome in high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is higher than that in low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, those who have the change of chromosome are related to the transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and have shorter survival time than those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
