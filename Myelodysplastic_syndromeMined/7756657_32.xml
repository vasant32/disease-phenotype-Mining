<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic features and ALL-1 (MLL, Htrxl, HRX) gene rearrangements in 17 cases of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that occurred 11 months to 9 years from diagnoses of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in children who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> or developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> typical of those associated with this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary diagnoses included nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), one was of mixed lineage, two were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and four presented as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 15 cases with 11q23 involvement, 11 (73%) were cytogenetically identifiable; four cases had molecular rearrangement only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Southern blot, rearrangements within the ALL-1 gene were similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis suggest the following: (1) In most pediatric cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, there is disruption of the breakpoint cluster region of the ALL-1 gene at chromosomal band 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, as the only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitor</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) There is clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in pediatric secondary 11q23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) There are some survivors of pediatric secondary 11q23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but the outcome is most often fatal </plain></SENT>
