<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> have shown significant clinical benefits in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), but their precise mode of action remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both drugs have been shown the ability to deplete DNA methyltransferase enzymes and to induce DNA demethylation and epigenetic reprogramming in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, drug-induced methylation changes have remained poorly characterized in patients and therapy-related models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now analyzed azacytidine-induced demethylation responses in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells showed remarkable differences in the drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of DNA methyltransferases that coincided with their demethylation responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these data, DNA methylation analysis of blood and bone marrow samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients undergoing azacytidine therapy also revealed substantial differences in the epigenetic responses of individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant, transient demethylation could be observed in 3 of 6 patients and affected many hypermethylated loci in a complex pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide important proof-of-mechanism data for the demethylating activity of azacytidine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and provide detailed insight into drug-induced demethylation responses </plain></SENT>
