<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like many other agents [e.g. chemotherapeutics etc] <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> selects the bone marrow as an important target but the exact location and the mechanism of damage is yet unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at delineating <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and related disorders in an experimental mouse model with a view to assessing the clinical hazards in human at a comparable event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observations made so far documented some quantitative and qualitative changes in the bone marrow population, especially involving the hematopoietic stem cells and related microenvironment, their immune responsiveness and survival fate of the cells at that particular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observations furnished that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> following occupational exposure can be hazardous by way of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> mediated dysfunction and, the microenvironmental studies conducted in some details indicated that the damage may be in the bone marrow stem cell niche </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some data collected showed an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of bone marrow cells and associated abnormalities in receptor expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and related growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Culminating the above data the study reveals that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> may cause target damage in the bone marrow stem cell niche [BM SC niche] both structurally and functionally, with the resultant disease expression as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
