<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While in early childhood a high number of B-cell precursors is found in the bone marrow, only very few such cells are usually detectable in adult bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the number of immature B cells present after haematopoietic cell transplantation the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive cells in regenerating bone marrow of adult patients was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow biopsy specimens were analysed from patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT; n = 14) or stem cell transplantation (SCT; n = 25) and autologous BMT (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 11 untransplanted adult patients and 11 infants were also studied, as negative and positive controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy sections using TdT as a marker of lymphoid progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for CD79a, CD20 and CD10 was used to confirm their B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using computer-assisted automated image analysis we quantitatively assessed the TdT+ cells present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a significant increase in the numbers of B-cell precursors in the bone marrow after allogeneic and autologous BMT/SCT compared with adult controls (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To analyse this in detail, we followed some patients after allogeneic BMT/SCT for up to 1445 days, when a marked B-cell increase was still detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the median number of TdT+ B cells after BMT/SCT was significantly lower than the number of equivalent B cells in infantile bone marrow biopsy specimens (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow of adult patients after BMT/SCT is capable of initiating vigorous precursor B-cell generation, which is not seen in untransplanted adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the increase of immature B cells was variable in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only in two young adult patients did it reach the magnitude of B-cell generation seen in infantile bone marrow where immunocompetent B cells are produced normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in number of immature B cells post-transplant may mimic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is a potential problem in patients transplanted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since reactive and neoplastic B-cell precursors share the same immunophenotype in paraffin-embedded tissue, additional tools, particularly molecular techniques, may have to be employed to establish the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
