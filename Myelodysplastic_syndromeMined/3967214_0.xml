<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), RA with excess of blasts (REAB), RA with ring sideroblasts, and RA in transformation presented a 2-3-fold increase in SCE frequency in the bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymphocytes from these patients showed only a marginal increase in SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of interchromosomal distribution of SCE indicated a preferential involvement of chromosomes in group C in patients with RA with excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the SCE in patients was not found to be influenced by the karyotype status </plain></SENT>
