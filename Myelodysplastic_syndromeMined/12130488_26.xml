<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are significant biologic and clinical differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied a cohort of 802 patients, 279 (35%) with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 523 (65%) with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and compared clinical and biologic characteristics of the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete clinical and cytogenetic data were available on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and a subgroup of patients was studied for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, proliferation, and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a discrete entity that is different from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and is characterized primarily by <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in early and mature hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using cell sorting and loss of heterozygosity, we demonstrate that the leukemic cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are capable of differentiation into mature myeloid cells and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that there is a significant overlap between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is defined on the basis of an arbitrary percentage of blasts of 20% or 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that despite similarities between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in their responses to treatment and outcomes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is biologically and clinically different from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and should not be considered an early phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> must be better defined on the basis of its biology rather than the percentage of blasts; further, the data suggest that there is a need to develop therapeutic approaches that specifically address the biologic abnormalities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
