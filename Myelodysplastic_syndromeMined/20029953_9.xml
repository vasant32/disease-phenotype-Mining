<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the additional prognostic impact of red blood cell transfusion need among 254 consecutive patients (median age, 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients ( approximately 24%) required transfusions at diagnosis whereas 22 ( approximately 9%) became transfusion-dependent and 170 remained transfusion-independent during the first year postdiagnosis; after a median follow-up of 55 months, the respective median survivals were 35, 25, and 117 months (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis confirmed the IPSS- and karyotype-independent prognostic weight of transfusion status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among IPSS intermediate-1 risk patients, overall median survival of 82 months was modified to 60 or 118 months, based on presence or absence of transfusion need, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for intermediate-2/high risk patients were 30 and 64 months (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Documented causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transfusion status in PMF downgrades or upgrades prognosis within specific IPSS categories; transfusion need is a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> biology in PMF, as it is in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
