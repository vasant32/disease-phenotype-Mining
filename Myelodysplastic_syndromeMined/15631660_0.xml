<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This research was aimed at evaluating immune state of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, analyzing the peripheral blood T cell subsets and CD3zeta chain expression and searching the possible reasons of hematopoietic disorders in 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 11 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed according to the new WHO diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used for the counts of IFNgamma(+)CD4(+) cell (Th1), IL4(+)CD4(+) cell (Th2), IFNgamma(+)CD8(+) cell (Tc1), and IL4(+)CD8(+) cell (Tc2), and for the analysis of expression of CD3zeta chain in T cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that CD8(+) cells increased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; there was no significant difference between Th1/Th2, Tc1/Tc2 ratios of T cell subsets and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control; CD3zeta chain, the functional protein in the signal transduction pathway of T cell, was over expressed in the CD8(+) cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, research indicates that abnormal changes of T cell subgroups exist in peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of CD8(+) cells and over-expression of CD3zeta chain are important features, which suggest that CD8(+) cells play the most critical role in the pathologic process as compared with other T cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The over active immunity mediated by T cell subset may be one of the major mechanisms resulting in cytopenia in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
