<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation of p73 promoter was detected in bone marrow cells from 135 MDS patients and 13 healthy controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of MSP were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary bone marrow cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, the changes of p73 methylation status and p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of p73 methylation in the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the correlated clinical data were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p73 hypermethylation was present in 37.04% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases and patients with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e>) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation than that of low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (58.8% vs 29.7%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of p73 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the methylated group was decreased compared to that of the unmethylated group (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> treatment decreased the level of p73 methylation and increased the level of p73 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with p73 methylation progressed rapidly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) and had shorter survival (P = 0.002) than those who did not have p73 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate Cox regression model, BM blast and p73 methylation status emerged as independent prognostic factor for overall survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p73 gene methylation is common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>p73 may be a therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
