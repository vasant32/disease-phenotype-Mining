<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed RPL23 expression in 169 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) by using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) marrow cells was examined by flow cytometry, and the correlation between RPL23 expression levels and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD34(+) cells was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then analyzed the clinical significance of RPL23 expression for predicting disease progression and patient survival as well as therapeutic response in patients administered with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, homoharringtonine, and G-CSF (CHG) regimen or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased RPL23 expression was found in patients with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in patients with lower-risk disease (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RPL23 expression levels were found being inversely correlated with decreased apoptotic ratio of CD34(+) cells in higher-risk patients (r = -0.672, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RPL23 expression levels, those with increased RPL23 expression presented higher rates of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.005) and reduced 2-year survival rates (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that RPL23 expression level was an independent predictor of prognosis, regardless of patient age, IPSS score, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with RPL23 over-expression appeared to have lower response rates to CHG chemotherapy (p = 0.027) but similar response rates to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the over-expression of RPL23 might confer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance in CD34(+) cells, which may lead to disease progression and adverse prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased RPL23 expression was an inverse indicator for CHG regimen, but not for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
