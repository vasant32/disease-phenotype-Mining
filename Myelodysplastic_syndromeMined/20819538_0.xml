<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD123 may also be high in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression and clinical significance of CD123 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor (CD114) on the bone marrow cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were investigated to explore the molecular marker of the malignant clone of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, who were diagnosed in the Hematological Department of General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from 2008 to 2009, and twelve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence activiated cell sorter (FACS) was used to measure the expression of CD123 on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and CD114 on CD34(+) cells of the bone marrow of these patients and controls and the clinical significance was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD114 on CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells was further measured to explore the molecular marker of the malignant clone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients displayed significantly higher proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+) ((14.03 +/- 5.27)%) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls ((7.70 +/- 4.36)%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression rate of CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+)CD38(-) was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients ((48.39 +/- 28.15)%) than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls ((8.75 +/- 11.71)%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression level of CD123 was significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.457, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression rate of CD114(+)CD34(+)/CD34(+) was lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients ((33.05 +/- 21.71)%) than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls ((38.99 +/- 19.07)%) but was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD114 on CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells ((34.82 +/- 29.58)%) was significantly lower than that on CD123(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells ((53.48 +/- 27.41)%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients displayed higher proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD123 was highly expressed in the bone marrow of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts, and thus might be the marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells exhibited lower expression of G-CSF receptors, which might partly explain why <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> clone responds worse to G-CSF in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
