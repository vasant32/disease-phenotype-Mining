<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used whole-genome sequencing to perform an unbiased comprehensive screen to discover the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in a sample from an individual with sAML and genotyped the loci containing these mutations in the matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a missense mutation affecting the serine at codon 34 (Ser34) in U2AF1 was recurrently present in 13 out of 150 (8.7%) subjects with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and we found suggestive evidence of an increased risk of progression to sAML associated with this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>U2AF1 is a U2 auxiliary factor protein that recognizes the AG splice acceptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> at the 3' end of introns, and the alterations in U2AF1 are located in highly conserved zinc fingers of this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutant U2AF1 promotes enhanced splicing and exon skipping in reporter assays in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This previously unidentified, recurrent mutation in U2AF1 implicates altered pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing as a potential mechanism for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
