<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Conflicting results have been published on whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of myeloid and erythroid cell lineages has been regularly observed, but it remains controversial whether the different lymphoid cell lineages are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study of eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to enumerate the chromosomes 7 in interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the probe D7Z1, the rate of false-positive detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was 3% +/- 2% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T- and B-cell lines were established from eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As determined by FISH in interphase cells, 1.9% (0% to 3%) of the cells in the B-cell lines showed one fluorescent spot and 1.1% (0% to 2.9%) of the cells in the T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These values do not differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells were selected when the T- and B-cell lines were established could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, peripheral blood cells were obtained, separated according to surface markers specific for lymphoid and myeloid cell lineage with a cell sorter, and analyzed for the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies recognizing T cells (CD3), B cells (CD20), natural killer (NK) cells (CD57), monocytes and granulocytes (low and high expression of CD11b antigen), and myeloid progenitors (CD33) were used to separate cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in the T cells, NK cells, and B cells did not differ from control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results in the lymphoid subpopulations are in stark contrast with the observations in the myeloid populations; the percentage of cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 ranged from 9% to 78% (controls: 6% +/- 2%) in cells with low CD11b expression, 20% to 89% in cells with a high expression of the CD11b antigen (controls: 7% +/- 3%), and 23% to 91% in the CD33 positive cells (controls: 5% +/- 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 does not usually affect lymphoid subpopulations but is restricted to committed progenitor cells with the capacity to differentiate into mature myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
