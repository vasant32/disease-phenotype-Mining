<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations postulate a participation of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune manifestations (AIMs) in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to compare the IRF-1 immunoexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with or without AIMs and to investigate its prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients entered this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall survival between patients with or without autoimmune manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox regression "IRF-1 expression in immature myeloid cells", Hb, and the IPSS risk group stratification were independent prognostic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bootstrap resampling confirmed these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression older patients with, higher platelet count and increased IRF-1 expression had a higher risk to develop autoimmune-like phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus our study shows that IRF-1 plays an ambiguous role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas high levels of IRF-1 in myeloid cells are a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival, they increase the probability of the manifestation of autoimmune phenomena, with a diminished quality of life </plain></SENT>
