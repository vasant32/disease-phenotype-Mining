<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cytogenetic abnormalities are currently the most important predictors of response and clinical outcome for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) or advanced-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because clinical outcomes vary markedly within cytogenetic subgroups, additional biological markers are needed for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the utility of measuring pretreatment proteasome chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities in plasma to predict response and survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 174) or advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three enzymatic activities were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased in the plasma of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, correlated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, predicted response in univariate analysis (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only chymotrypsin-like activity was independent predictor of response from age grouping (&lt;70 versus &gt; or =70 years), cytogenetics, and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, were predictors of overall survival in univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.0001), but only chymotrypsin-like activity was independent of cytogenetics, age, performance status, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, and beta(2)-microglobulin in multivariate Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chymotrypsin-like activity was also a strong independent predictor of survival in patients with intermediate karyotype (n = 124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measuring plasma chymotrypsin-like activity may provide a powerful biomarker for risk stratification in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
