<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the feasibility of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen in a phase II clinical trial using fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> undergoing T-cell depleted HaploSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients were entered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engraftment with donor-derived hematopoiesis was achieved in 78% of patients after a median of 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced primary graft failure, three out of four tested patients had donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HaploSCT with this fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa and ATG RIC is an effective, well-tolerated conditioning regimen for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> with low disease burden at the time of transplant and allowed a high rate of engraftment in patients without DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with overt relapse fared poorly and require novel treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
