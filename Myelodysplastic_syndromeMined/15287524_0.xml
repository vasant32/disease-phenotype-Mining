<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA underwent RIST from her HLA-matched brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was favorable and grade 2 GVHD (skin and intestine) was observed with good response to 60 mg of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 162, she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> and abnormal neurological findings including cervical stiffness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 80 cells/microl, a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of 50 mg/dl and a protein level of 97 mg/dl on day 162 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although computed tomography (CT) of the brain and electroencephalography (EEG) were nonspecific, HHV-6 was detected in the CSF using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and the patient was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> due to local reactivation of HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> (GCV) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> (ACV) were started from day 162 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> was effective, with total resolution of her symptoms and the DNA of this virus disappeared from the CSF after 23 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case shows that HHV-6 infection has to be considered in patients with neurological symptoms following stem cell transplantation, and suggests the necessity of PCR for HHV-6 virus from the CSF </plain></SENT>
