<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to quantify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Bcl-2 expression in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and to use these parameters in the evaluation of treatment efficacy with compounds modulating proapoptotic cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) samples from eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were studied: four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> without BM determination were studied for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted in administration of pentoxyphylline, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and ciprofloxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical assay of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Bcl-2 was performed using annexin V-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> conjugate antibody and anti-human Bcl-2 antibody respectively, followed by streptavidine-peroxidase conjugate, and peroxidase substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural investigation of BM samples was performed with standard electron microscopy techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of BM hematopoietic cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had ultrastructural features of various stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasm condensation and budding of nuclear and plasma membranes to produce apoptotic bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression showed an inverse correlation with the rate of the apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periodic evaluation of these two parameters has shown an increase of Bcl-2 expression and a decrease of apoptotic rate in patients who had responded to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Response to the treatment was appreciated in accordance with their transfusion needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficiency diminished in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was inversely correlated with the level of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the importance of the apoptotic process evaluation in monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
