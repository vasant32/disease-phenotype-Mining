<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that in addition to the MLL core amplicon, independent sequences in 11q23-24 and/or 11q13.5 are coamplified within the same cytogenetic markers in 90% and 60% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we further narrow down the minimal amplicon in 11q13.5 to 1.17 Mb by means of semi-quantitative PCR and FISH analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The newly defined amplicon contains seven genes, including the GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using real-time RT-PCR we show a significant transcriptional upregulation of GAB2 in the patients who have GAB2 coamplified with MLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the adaptor molecule GAB2 that has already been shown to enhance oncogenic signaling in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> appears as a novel target of 11q amplification in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
