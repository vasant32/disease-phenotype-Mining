<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human CAN gene was first identified as a target of t(6;9)(p23;q34), associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, which results in the expression of a DEK-CAN fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CAN, also called NUP214, is a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein that contains multiple FG-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It interacts at the NPC with at least two other proteins, the nucleoporin NUP88 and hCRM1 (exportin 1), which was recently shown to function as a nuclear export receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of CAN in knockout mouse embryonic cells results in cell cycle arrest in G2, followed by inhibition of nuclear protein import and a block of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We overexpressed CAN and DEK-CAN in U937 myeloid precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DEK-CAN expression did not interfere with terminal myeloid differentiation of U937 cells, whereas CAN-overexpressing cells arrested in G0, accumulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in their nuclei, and died in an apoptotic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that hCRM1 and import factor p97/importin beta colocalized with the ectopically expressed CAN protein, resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of both factors from the NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the C-terminal FG-repeat region of CAN, which contains the binding site for hCRM1, caused sequestering of hCRM1 in the nucleoplasm and was sufficient to inhibit cell growth and to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that CAN plays a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and imply an essential role for hCRM1 in cell growth and survival </plain></SENT>
