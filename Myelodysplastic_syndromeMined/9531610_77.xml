<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest frequent methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene promoter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and it has been proposed that this methylation could be necessary for leukemic cells to escape TGF beta regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the methylation status of p15(INK4b) gene in 53 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases, including nine that had progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), using a recently described sensitive method where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is preceded by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modification of DNA (methylation specific PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p15(INK4b) methylation was observed in 20 of 53 (38%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 24 patients with greater than 10% bone marrow blasts had p15(INK4b) methylation (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients who had progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) as compared with none of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with &lt;10% bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation between karyotypic abnormalities and methylation status was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with p15(INK4b) methylation had a worse prognosis, but the prognostic significance of p15(INK4b) methylation was no more found by multivariate analysis, due to its strong correlation to the percentage of marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 MDS cases, sequential DNA samples were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five of them, methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene was detected at leukemic transformation, but not at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is correlated with blastic bone marrow involvement and increases with disease evolution toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It suggests that proliferation of leukemic cells might require an escape of regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and possibly of TGF beta inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
