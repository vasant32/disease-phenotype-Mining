<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating (GM-CSF) were studied in a phase I/II trial of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously (SC) daily so as to achieve prolonged blood levels and to establish an outpatient treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four dose levels were administered for ten days: 0.3 microgram/kg/d (three patients), 1.0 microgram/kg/d (three), 3.0 micrograms/kg/d (four), and 10.0 micrograms/kg/d (six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1558931" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">flu-like syndrome</z:e>, which were dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum-tolerated dose was 10.0 micrograms/kg/d, which induced severe rigors (two patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> greater than 40 degrees C (one), severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchospasm</z:e> (one), and WBC 60,000 (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after two doses of GM-CSF, and the patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that did not respond to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After doses of 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms/kg, serum GM-CSF levels peaked at 3.8 to 6.3 hours, and persisted for 14 and 24 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating granulocytes (neutrophils and bands) increased in a dose-dependent manner, as 11 of 13 patients who received greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/kg/d responded with a two- to 194-fold increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the neutrophils usually returned to pretreatment levels shortly after stopping GM-CSF, two patients continue to exhibit an elevation of neutrophils for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dose-related increases in circulating monocytes and eosinophils were also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts were observed in two and three patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of the 16 patients later received maintenance GM-CSF at 3 micrograms/kg/d for 2 to 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed a dramatic increase in neutrophils after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, despite continued therapy, the neutrophil count in four patients declined markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GM-CSF is well tolerated by the SC route and induces striking, but usually temporary, improvement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective phase III trials will determine the duration of hematologic responses and the impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, morbidity, and mortality </plain></SENT>
