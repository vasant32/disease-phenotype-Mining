<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerable parts of blast cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients remained immature as compared with the favorable maturation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blast cells, especially in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group that included two prominent cases with a remarkable blast cell growth without maturation induction by CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short-term clinical administrations of G-CSF often brought about hematological improvements on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other cytokines are also reported to be of use on some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a few cases progressed to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in relation to G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Much care should be taken with in vivo application of CSFs to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, although there may be no effective clue to foresee the risk of leukemic transformation yet </plain></SENT>
