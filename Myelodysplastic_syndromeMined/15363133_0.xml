<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-CdR) on cell of high-risk patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in vitro, the growth inhibition of MUTZ-1 cell induced by 5-Aza-CdR was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by morphological observation and translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) was examined by flow cytometry assay; the expressions of P15INK4B, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)(1), DNMT(3A) and DNMT(3B) gene on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level were detected by RT-PCR; methylation of p15INK4B gene in MUTZ-1 cells was detected by PCR using methylation specific primer (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 5-Aza-CdR inhibited the growth of MUTZ-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) values of 24, 48 and 72 hours were 6.75, 2.82 and 5.45 mmol/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic changes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> emerged in MUTZ-1 cells after being exposed to 5-Aza-CdR in the different concentration from 0.8 mmol/L to 3.2 mmol/L, and the positive cells of annexin V on the membrane of MUTZ-1 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5-Aza-CdR could activate the p15INK4B gene expression in MUTZ-1 cells by demethylation of the p15INK4B gene in a dose-dependent manner after the cells were treated for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5-Aza-CdR could significantly down-regulate the expressions of DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT(3A) at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it had no effects on DNMT(1) gene and DNMT(3B) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that 5-Aza-CdR can inhibit the growth of MUTZ-1 cells and induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of these cells within the range of concentration from 0.8 mmol/L to 3.2 mmol/L, which may be one of the mechanisms of antitumor effects of 5-Aza-CdR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The drug can activate the expression of p15INK4B gene in MUTZ-1 cells by demethylation of the p15INK4B gene through inhibiting the expression of DNMT(3A) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be the mechanism of 5-Aza-CdR in the treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
