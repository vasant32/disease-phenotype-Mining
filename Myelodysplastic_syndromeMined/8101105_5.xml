<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She presented with features compatible with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation, but soon progressed into overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intensive chemotherapy successfully induced a complete remission, but she later relapsed into a second myelodysplastic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although analysis at presentation and relapse showed that hematopoiesis was clonal at both phases of the patient's disease, the genotype of the two clones was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe the unexpected finding of a switch in clonality shows new insights into the biology and origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
