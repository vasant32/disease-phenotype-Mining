<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The immunomodulatory and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> thalidomide was first introduced in 1957 as a sleep aid and treatment for morning sickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was subsequently removed from the market due to severe teratogenic side effects and then returned to the market as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide is an analog of thalidomide with similar efficacy but improved side-effect profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are reports and studies of both agents for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0458219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complex regional pain syndrome</z:e> (CRPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effective medical and interventional therapies for CRPS are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of novel immunomodulatory and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> such as thalidomide and lenalidomide may offer a new approach to the treatment of CRPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: The mechanism of action, adverse effect profile, and regulatory history of thalidomide and lenalidomide will be reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The literature search for pain treatment includes case series and preliminary trials for CRPS, and case reports and case series for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Lenalidomide has a more favorable adverse effect profile compared to its parent compound thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both agents, however, have significant potential adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evidence of efficacy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain syndromes such as CRPS remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed before these agents can be recommended for use in CRPS or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain syndromes </plain></SENT>
