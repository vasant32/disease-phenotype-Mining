<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 72-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was admitted to our hospital and later died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041321" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Miliary tuberculosis</z:e> was diagnosed at autopsy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>13 of the 39 hospital staff members who had had contact with the patient were infected, and 3 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the latter 3 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> patients, the only contact point two had had with the index case was in the autopsy room, and the other had had contact both in the autopsy room and on the ward </plain></SENT>
