<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the possibilities of maintaining the therapeutic potential of marrow allografting in the absence of GVHD is to intensify the conditioning regimen administered pre-T-cell depleted BMT in order to compensate for the loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> related graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (GVL) effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to do so we used a preparative regimen consisting of three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi> (BU), Thiotepa (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY)-for T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) instead of the standard BU-CY protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of this intensified regimen was investigated in 30 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients who underwent T-cell depleted SCT from HLA identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the patients were males and 14 females, of median age 24 (5-43) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), four <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of BU 4 mg/kg x 4 days (-8 to -5), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> 5 mg/kg x 2 days (-4 and -3), and CY 60 mg/kg x 2 days (-2 and -1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with WBC &gt;1.0x10(9)/l at day +18 (10-32), ANC &gt;0.5x10(9)/l at day +21 (9-33) and platelets &gt;25x10(9)/l at day +30 (14-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regimen related toxicity (RRT) was moderate and transplant related complications comparable to other conventional conditioning protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and disease free survival (DFS) at 60 months follow up was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only three patients (10%), with ALL, relapsed and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the current data it would appear that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> does not significantly improve BMT outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, when compared to the standard BU-CY conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, our results with the BU-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>-CY combination followed by T-cell depleted allogeneic SCT could provide the basis for a prospective randomized study comparing this protocol with the standard BU-CY regimen </plain></SENT>
