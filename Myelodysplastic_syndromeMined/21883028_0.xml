<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into subgroups according to the pretransplant SF level [&lt; 1000 ng/mL (low) vs. â‰¥ 1000 ng/mL (high)] and disease status at transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high SF level was significantly associated with high disease risk (p = 0.041), but pretransplant SF and disease risk were independent significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and non-relapse mortality rate (NRM) on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high-SF group showed a worse outcome than the low-SF group among both standard-risk patients (OS: 54% vs. 64%, p = 0.043; DFS: 46% vs. 57%, p = 0.031) and high-risk patients (OS: 16% vs. 35%, p = 0.001; DFS: 15% vs. 34%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a high SF at transplant adversely influences the outcome of allo-HSCT regardless of disease risk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
