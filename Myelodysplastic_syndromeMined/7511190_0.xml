<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some patients, prognosis is poor due to proliferation of immature cells, i.e. development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important clinical decision for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> is whether to treat with supportive care or to use cytoreductive drugs to control the proliferative component of these illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are presented where cell surface antigen phenotype analysis showed characteristics suggestive of proliferative disease and the patients were treated and obtained remission with cytoablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell surface marker analysis may be useful in guiding therapeutic decisions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
