<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 29-year-old man, who had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 1 year before, developed a wound on his thigh and knee due to necrotising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty h after a free thoracodorsal artery perforator flap transfer, the colour of the flap changed from pink to purple, starting from the peripheral margin and epitheliolysis proceeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within a week, the colour returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spontaneously and the flap survived completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On punch biopsy, the lesion was confirmed as leucocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, necrotising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the small vessels in the dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that leucocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> mimics postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> of a free flap; hence, differential diagnosis by careful judgement of vascular status is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This rare occurrence needs to be considered in free-flap monitoring, especially in immunosuppressed patients </plain></SENT>
