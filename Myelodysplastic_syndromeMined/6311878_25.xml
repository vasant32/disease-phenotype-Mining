<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil function studies have been carried out in a series of 44 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro tests of phagocytosis and killing of Candida guilliermondii and Staphylococcus aureus identified 13 patients with abnormal neutrophil function at presentation and a further 10 who developed abnormalities during the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of defective function in the five disease categories in this series was: refractory cytopenia (RC) 8/17; refractory cytopenia with sideroblastic change (RC + SC) 5/8; acquired idiopathic sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AISA) 2/4; refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) 7/11; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) 1/4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 23 patients with defective neutrophil function experienced severe infective complications; in only three of these patients were neutrophil counts less than 1 X 10(9)/l and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> was considered to reflect, at least partially, qualitative neutrophil abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between absolute neutrophil count and defective function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal overall neutrophil microbicidal activity was equally associated with impaired and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some patients with intracellular killing defects had reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and one had reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> monophosphate shunt (HMPS) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients, whose neutrophils showed markedly impaired candidacidal activity, levamisole corrected function when added in vitro at 10(-7) M and also when administered in therapeutic dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that deranged function, probably reflecting abnormalities in maturation of the granulocyte series, occurs across the myelodysplastic spectrum and that several microbicidal mechanisms may be defective </plain></SENT>
