<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such increases were found neither with rhG-CSF samples pretreated with rabbit anti-rhG-CSF serum nor with other human colony-stimulating factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons and patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> were tested after dialysis using this system in order to determine whether G-CSF levels in sera can be estimated or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons, five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M1, M2, and M3), five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, no increases in [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake were found within the dose range of 0.4 microliters to 50 microliters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, linear dose responses parallel to a G-CSF standard curve were observed in one patient with a severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (AMMoL) (M4), and two with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the standard curve, the probable levels of G-CSF were calculated as follows: approximately 200 pg/ml with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 130-220 pg/ml with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 150 and 200 pg/ml with AMMoL, and 1120 and 1200 pg/ml with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activities of sera were reduced by the anti-rhG-CSF serum pretreatment in the same way as documented in the case of rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level in a patient with a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> became undetectable soon after elimination of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and blood neutrophil counts had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the microbioassay system will be useful for measuring circulating G-CSF levels which would fluctuate in accord with requirements for stimulating neutrophil production or with abnormal production of hG-CSF </plain></SENT>
