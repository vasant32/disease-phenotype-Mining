<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have demonstrated robust antiproliferative effects of CuB on various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, as well as on primary mononuclear bone marrow cells derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloid leukemic cells treated with CuB exhibit significant S-phase cell cycle arrest, enlarged cell size, multinucleation, and enhanced expression of a monocytic- and granulocytic-specific CD11b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data demonstrate that CuB prominently alters the cytoskeletal network of leukemic cells, inducing rapid and improper polymerization of the F-actin network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These encouraging results suggest the appropriateness of clinical trials of cucurbitacins for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
