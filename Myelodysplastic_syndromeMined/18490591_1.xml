<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case series, we assessed the diagnostic importance of karyotypic analysis of bone marrow cells in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated pyodermic eruptions treated at our university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis was performed in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Four patients with pyodermic eruptions or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> had chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow cells, including del(20)(q11;q13.3) in 2 patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in 1 patient, and t(11;22)(q23;q11) in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients without morphologic findings suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One female patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> associated with del(20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with elevated serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor had more active or widespread cutaneous diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Karyotypic analysis of bone marrow cells, but not of peripheral blood lymphocytes, is essential in proving a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated pyodermic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which may compensate for <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>impaired hematopoiesis</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, seems to be a key cytokine leading to neutrophilic infiltration </plain></SENT>
