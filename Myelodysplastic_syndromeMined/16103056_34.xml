<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> on the genomic methylation level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of different assays established micellar electrokinetic chromatography as a reliable method for the analysis of genomic methylation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When used for the determination of DNA methylation levels in bone marrow DNA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients during various time points of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment, the results revealed a significant (up to 70%) demethylation in five of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, genome-wide demethylation appeared after karyotype normalization, which suggests demethylation of nonclonal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced demethylation dynamics were also confirmed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing of pericentromeric satellite elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results are the first to show a genome-wide demethylating activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data uncovers novel targets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>-mediated demethylation that are important for the refinement of treatment schedules with demethylating drugs </plain></SENT>
