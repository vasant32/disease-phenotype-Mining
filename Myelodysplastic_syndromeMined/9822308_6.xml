<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The quantitative measurement of the expression of both cytoplasmic and surface CD63 antigen by human mast cells from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological bone marrow samples was studied by use of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our major goal was to analyze whether in vivo CD63 expression by human bone marrow mast cells could be useful to discriminate bone marrow mast cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> from other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For that purpose, a total of 65 subjects corresponding to 12 healthy volunteers, 25 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 5 reactive bone marrow samples, 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of both surface and cytoplasmic CD63 by human bone marrow mast cells is clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that high amounts of CD63 are present in human bone marrow mast cells most of it corresponding to an intracellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in CD63 expression were observed as regards both total and cytoplasmic CD63, except for higher CD63 levels in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the mean level of surface CD63 significantly varied between the different groups of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathies</z:e> displayed a slight decrease (P = 0.1) in surface CD63 expression, whereas bone marrow mast cells from adults with indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic mast cell disease</z:e> showed significantly (P = 0.0005) higher levels of surface CD63 as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
