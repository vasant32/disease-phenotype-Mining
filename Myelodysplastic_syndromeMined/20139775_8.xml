<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the capability of 6 serum-free DC culture methods, chosen according to different mechanisms, to induce DC differentiation in 137 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 52 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DC-stimulating substances were cytokines ("standard-medium", "MCM-Mimic", "cytokine-method"), <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> lysates ("Picibanil"), double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> ["Poly (I:C)"] or a cytokine bypass method ("Ca-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality/quantity of DC generated was estimated by flow cytometry studying (co) expressions of "DC"antigens, costimulatory, maturation, and blast-antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing these methods on average 15% to 32% DC, depending on methods used, could be obtained from blast-containing mononuclear cells (MNC) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> cases with a DC viability of more than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 39% to 64% of these DC were mature; 31% to 52% of leukemic blasts could be converted to DCleu and DCleu-proportions in the suspension were 2% to 70% (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> culture methods tested were comparable, however not every given case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> could be differentiated to DC with 1 selected method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However performing a pre-analysis with 3 DC-generating methods (MCM-Mimic, Picibanil, Ca-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>) we could generate DC in any given case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses provided proof, that DC primed T cells to antileukemia-directed cytotoxic cells, although an anti-leukemic reaction was not achieved in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary our data show that a successful, quantitative DC/DCleu generation is possible with the best of 3 previously tested methods in any given case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reasons for different functional behaviors of DC-primed T cells must be evaluated to design a practicable DC-based vaccination strategy </plain></SENT>
