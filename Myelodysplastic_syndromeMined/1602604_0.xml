<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sagittal images from the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebral marrow were evaluated on short TI IR sequences (STIR, IR 2000/160/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four distinct patterns of signal intensity (SI) of the STIR images corresponding with active red marrow were classified as follows: pattern I, homogeneously low SI (4 cases); II, marginally high SI (2 cases); III, heterogeneously high SI (8 cases); IV, homogeneously high SI (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SI distribution of STIR images strongly correlated with the cellularity of clot specimens of aspirates from sternum using the Wiebel test plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with AA, the STIR images revealed pattern I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the STIR images were classified into pattern III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the STIR image showed low SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The STIR images of two AA patients at clinical remission after treatment showed marginally high SI similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI of bone marrow can be a useful technique for the diagnosis of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and for monitoring therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
