<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 22) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (n = 25) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 70% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> less than 50 x 10(3)/microL in 51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/ m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 3 to 4 weeks until remission, then once every month for a maximum of 12 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (28%) achieved a complete response (CR) and six (13%) had hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A CR was achieved in six of 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (27%) and in seven of 25 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities) who achieved CR were cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Characteristics for which there was evidence of association with a higher response rate were lack of prior chemotherapy, less than 10% marrow monocytes, and absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> oncogene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CR rates were similar in patients with or without abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mucositis occurred in 64% of patients (severe in 19%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 32% (severe in 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Febrile episodes occurred in 85% of patients and documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 8 months, the 12-month survival rate was 38%, median survival time 10.5 months, and median remission duration 7.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that topotecan has significant activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, with acceptable side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies will investigate topotecan combined with topoisomerase II reactive agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, or hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
