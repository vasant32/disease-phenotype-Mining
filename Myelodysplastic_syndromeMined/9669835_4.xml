<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that, in some cases, a part of the so-called 'lost' chromosome 5 and 7 material, was actually translocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These translocations may be either end-arm or whole-arm, as well as small insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes 5 or 7 may be broken in more than two segments, defining 'fragmentation', giving rise to marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH allowed the identification of small material insertion, which is totally unidentified by classical cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 5 and 7 translocations occur irrespectively of the 'de novo' or 'secondary' type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
