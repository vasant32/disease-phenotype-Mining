<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses with probes for the three regions 5p15.2, 5q31, 5q33-q34, and whole chromosome 5 painting probes (WCP 5) to investigate what further information could be gained regarding the cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 5 in 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With FISH, a del(5q) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except for two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations of material from chromosome 5 were found in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 16 patients with clones of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 seen by cytogenetics, 14 had deletions or translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different breakpoints on chromosome 5 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the extended FISH analyses yielded additional information about chromosome 5 abnormalities in 60% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of interest is the finding of a high proportion of translocations and that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5 occurs less often than is generally believed </plain></SENT>
