<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we review currently available data on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> treatment in lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a phase III study, a subset of patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 60% and a longer median OS compared with supportive care (44 vs 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a phase II study investigating various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> dose schedules, the hematological improvement rate was approximately 50% in lower-risk patients; most patients who achieved transfusion independence were also lower-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further retrospective study reported an ORR of 52% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> lower-risk patients who received &gt; or = 4 cycles of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> combination therapy with erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> are intriguing but should be treated with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the feasibility and effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> in the treatment of patients with lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
