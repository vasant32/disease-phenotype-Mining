<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared these regimens as initial chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients (N = 856) with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> were randomly assigned to treatment with ABVD or MOPP/ABV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major end points were failure-free and overall survival, life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicities, and serious long-term toxicities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, pulmonary toxicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of complete remission (76% v 80%, P =.16), failure-free survival at 5 years (63% v 66%, P =.42), and overall survival at 5 years (82% v 81%, P =.82) were similar for ABVD and MOPP/ABV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary and hematologic toxicity were more common with MOPP/ABV (P =.060 and.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to initial treatment: nine with ABVD and 15 with MOPP/ABV (P =.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There have been 18 second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> associated with ABVD and 28 associated with MOPP/ABV (P =.13) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ABVD and the MOPP/ABV hybrid are effective therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MOPP/ABV is associated with a greater incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ABVD should be considered the standard regimen for treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
