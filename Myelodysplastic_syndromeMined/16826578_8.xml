<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current prospective multicenter study examined the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), patients were stratified into 2 groups: favorable (IPSS score, 0-1.0) or unfavorable (IPSS score, 1.5-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients (42 of whom were favorable and 30 of whom were unfavorable) received a starting dose of oral thalidomide of 200 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose was increased by 50 mg per week to a targeted maximum daily dose of 1000 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the International Working Group response criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, 1 patient in the unfavorable group achieved a partial remission with a complete cytogenetic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 2 patients (5%) in the favorable group and 4 patients (14%) in the unfavorable group experienced either a hematologic improvement or a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent Grade 3 or 4 (grading was based on the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) nonhematologic adverse events were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (24%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (19%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide alone, at the schedule and dose levels used in the current study, is not a safe and viable therapeutic option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limited efficacy and increased toxicity were observed in the current Phase II trial </plain></SENT>
