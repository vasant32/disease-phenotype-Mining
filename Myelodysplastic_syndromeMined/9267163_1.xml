<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematological data on admission showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum serological studies revealed polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, a positive microsome and thyroid test, and positive reaction to antithyroglobulin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of a cervical lymph node revealed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large cells of B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow smears revealed hypercellularity with dysplastic features including pseudo-Pelger and other nuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0001874'>abnormalities of neutrophils</z:hpo>, micromegakaryocytes, dyserythropoiesis with megalobastic changes, 60% ring sideroblast and with no increase in proportion of blast cells (3.6%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remission of ML obtained with radiation and subsequent systemic chemotherapy with CHOP-Bleo regimen, although she died 2.5 yr after the diagnosis due to relapse of ML without leukemic transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although basic disturbances in these three conditions are not clear, it is evident that treatment was not concerned with the pathogenesis in this case, because the three conditions existed without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be hypothesized that an initial event which selects a clone of stem cells that retains the capacity to differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid line would manifest with the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> in the myeloid line and with the sort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> reported in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent events select subclones and these progressively lose terminal differentiation, culminating as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
