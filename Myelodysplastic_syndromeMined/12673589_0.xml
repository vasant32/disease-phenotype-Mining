<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of a panel fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, whose karyotypes were unknown by the FISH examiner beforehand, were analyzed with a panel FISH using YAC248F5 (5q31), YAC938G5 (7q32), CEP8 and YAC 912C3 (20q12) probes to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, -/7q-, +8, 20q-) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the results were compared to those of conventional cytogenetics (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, on CC examination, only five cases were found to have common chromosomal abnormalities (20q-, four cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, marker chromosome and complex abnormalities comprising -5, -7 and marker chromosomes were seen in one case each, the rest were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Panel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
