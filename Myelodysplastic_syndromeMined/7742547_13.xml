<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A t(5;12)(q33;p13) translocation is a recurrent chromosome abnormality in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> with features of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular consequence of a t(5;12) is a fusion between the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-B gene on chromosome 5 and a novel ETS-like gene, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>, on chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on three patients with a t(5;12)(q33;p13) diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and one case of a t(10;12)(q24;p13) in a progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene in these chromosome translocations was investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with cosmid probes containing selectively the 5' end or 3' end of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybridization of these cosmids to the der(5)/der(10) or a der(12), respectively, demonstrated a rearrangement of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> in both translocations, showing that the t(10;12) is a variant translocation of the t(5;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cloning of the fusion cDNA of one case of t(5;12) showed that the breakpoint occurred at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level at exactly the same position as reported by Golub et al (Cell 77:307, 1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene on chromosome 12 could be localized between two probes previously mapped to 12p13, namely PRB1 and D12S178, leading to a better definition of the position of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> in this chromosome region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the case involving chromosome 10, the breakpoint occurred between cKTN206 and cKTN312/LYT-10 at 10q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicohematological data in these studies as well as the restriction mapping of chromosomal breakpoints strongly suggest that (1) common features in MDSs involving the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene are <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, (2) chromosomes other than no. 5 may be involved and at least a t(10;12)(q24;p13) variant chromosome translocation does exist in these MDSs, and (3) both standard and variant 12p/TEL translocations may be identified by FISH with appropriate probes </plain></SENT>
