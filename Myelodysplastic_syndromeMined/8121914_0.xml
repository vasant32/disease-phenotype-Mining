<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present follow-up covers 1448 years/patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy was seldom discontinued because of blood toxicity or gastrointestinal intolerance, but it was stopped in 20 percent of the cases because monitoring was difficult in very old patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy reduced the mean annual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> dose by at least 50 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the actual risk of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) was similar in the two arms of the protocol: 14 percent at the 10th year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the French population of the same age-groups, there was no excess of epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy did not control platelet counts perfectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of severe vascular events was identical in both arms; probably no higher than expected at that age and significantly lower than in previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival curves in both groups showed a 50 percent survival of about 11 years, i.e. very near to that of the reference French population (12.5 years) of similar sex and age </plain></SENT>
