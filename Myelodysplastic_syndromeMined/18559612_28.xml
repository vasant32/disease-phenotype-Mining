<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Molecular characterization of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, such as systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> (SM), has provided a clear rationale for investigating novel targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> is 325-fold more potent against Bcr-Abl TK than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> in vitro, significantly inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs, and is active against cells carrying the mutant KIT-D816V gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this phase 2, open-label study, the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> (140 mg/d) was investigated in 67 patients with various Ph- myeloid disorders, including SM (n = 33; 28 KIT-D816V positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> in patients with SM was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only two patients, one with SM-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> and one with SM-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, achieved complete response (elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>) lasting for 5 and 16 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients were negative for KIT-D816V mutation, had low tryptase levels, abnormal WBC counts, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and had failed prior therapy with erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional nine SM patients had symptomatic response, lasting 3 to 18+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete responses were achieved in two other patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1540912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hypereosinophilic syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No responses were observed among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of adverse events were grade 1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> therapy may benefit a selected group of SM patients, primarily by improving their symptoms, but it does not eliminate the disease in the patients with KIT-D816V mutation </plain></SENT>
