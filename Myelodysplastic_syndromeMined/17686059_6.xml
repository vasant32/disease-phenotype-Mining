<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that epigenetic repression of the AKAP12 gene might occur in malignant myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the 5' CpG island of AKAP12 was unmethylated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoietic progenitors and granulocytes but exhibited profound methylation in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 leukaemic myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, AKAP12 was expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors but transcriptionally silent in leukaemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Re-expression of AKAP12 in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells was accomplished by treatment with MS275 alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi>, indicating epigenetic mechanisms of gene repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AKAP12 hypermethylation was found in one case of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in a panel of 21 blood or bone marrow samples from children with malignant myeloid disorders including refractory cytopenia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, juvenile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While AKAP12 function has not been previously linked to leukaemogenesis, our results raise the possibility that epigenetic silencing of AKAP12 is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
