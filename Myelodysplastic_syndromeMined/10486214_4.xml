<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is a recurring abnormality in malignant myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we identified an approximately 1-Mb segment in 5q31 that was deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As part of a positional cloning project to identify transcribed sequences in this region, we identified and characterized the TTID gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This gene contains 10 exons that extend over 19 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The composite cDNA is approximately 2.3 kb and encodes a protein of 498 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal half of this putative protein contains an internally repeated domain of 43 amino acids, which resembles the N-terminal half of an immunoglobulin domain from the immense skeletal muscle protein titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TTID gene is expressed in multiple muscle tissue types as well as in thyroid gland and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the gene as a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene by searching for mutations in malignant myeloid disorders with abnormalities of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we detected no inactivating mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide change (G to A) was identified at nucleotide position 1889 in the untranslated region of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, which may represent a polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TTID is unlikely to be the candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene involved in malignant myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
