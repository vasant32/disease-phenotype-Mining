<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 68-year-old man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and developed overt ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cytogenetically independent clones, one with 5q- and the other with 20q-, were observed when the patient developed ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clones carrying both 5q- and 20q- were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukemic blast cells were positive for peroxidase, naphtol <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> chloroacetate esterase, CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR, but negative for alpha-naphthyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> esterase, CD14, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there have been a few reports describing the presence of multiple cytogenetically unrelated clones in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, this is the first case report that the 5q- and 20q- anomalies are derived from independent clones </plain></SENT>
