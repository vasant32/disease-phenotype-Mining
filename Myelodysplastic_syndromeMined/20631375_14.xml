<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with low- or intermediate-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were stratified by baseline platelet counts (&lt; 50 vs ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L) and randomized to romiplostim 500 μg or 750 μg or placebo subcutaneously once weekly during 4 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events, defined by grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> starting on day 15 of the first cycle or platelet transfusion at any time during the 4-cycle treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No formal hypothesis testing was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events in patients receiving romiplostim 500 μg, romiplostim 750 μg, or placebo was 62%, 71%, and 85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of platelet transfusions was 46%, 36%, and 69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were not statistically significant with the small numbers in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Romiplostim 750 μg significantly raised median platelet counts during cycle 3 on day 1 (P = .0373) and at the nadir (P = .0035) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 rash and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> each were reported in 1 romiplostim-treated patient (4%) </plain></SENT>
