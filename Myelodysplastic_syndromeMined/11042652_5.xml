<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PBSC were mobilized with G-CSF (7.5 microg/kg/day) and yielded a median of 6.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 1.6-15.0) and 2.7 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/kg (range, 1.1-7.1) vs marrow grafts with a median of 2.0 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg (range, 1.8-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recovery was significantly faster after PBSCT compared to BMT, with a median of 17 (range, 12-26) vs 26 (range, 16-36) days, respectively, to neutrophils &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/l (P &lt; 0.01), and 22 (range, 12-&gt;60) vs 42 (range, 18-&gt;60) days, for platelet recovery (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of &gt;/=7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg accelerated recovery to &gt;20 x 10(9) l platelets; median 17 days (range, 12-19) vs 23 days (range, 17-36) for those receiving &lt;7 x 10(6)/kg (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
