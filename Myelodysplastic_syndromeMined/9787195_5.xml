<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify potential new genes homologous to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>,1,2 we screened the dbEST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./dbEST/index.html) using the entire <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> cDNA sequence as a probe (EMBL accession no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>X79990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the ESTs identified, we selected two overlapping clones (clone IDs 43629 and 274508) and sequenced them to completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A putative translation initiation site was identified by the presence of a strong Kozak consensus sequence,3 followed by a 1,725-bp open reading frame (ORF) coding for a putative protein of 575 amino acids (aa) (GenBank accession no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF068266) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We named this gene EHT (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> Homologous on chromosome Twenty; see mapping data below) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The putative EHT protein is closely homologous to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>/MTG8 (65% identity) and Nervy, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> Drosophila homolog (24% identity) showing the four conserved domains found in MTG8 and Nervy.4 To find EST clones that could represent the EHT 5UTR, we screened the dbEST data bank with the 5 end of clone 274508, and identified an EST clone (GenBank accession no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AA635096) encompassing the EHT ATG codon, preceded by an in-frame stop codon 129 bp upstream (Fig 1, top) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we considered this sequence the putative 5UTR of EHT gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While this work was in progress, the cloning of a similar ORF, named MTGR1 (myeloid translocation gene-related protein 1) was reported5; it presents an ATG codon, immediately preceded by a stop codon and with no clear Kozak sequence, upstream to and in-frame with the EHT ATG (see Fig 1, top), leading to the coding of additional 29 aa with respect to EHT ORF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Calabi and Cilli have recently deposited in the dbEST data bank a 5 UTR MTGR1 sequence (accession no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF052212) that is identical to the putative EHT 5 UTR (GenBank clone AA635096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data suggest the presence of two alternative 5 ends in the MTGR1/EHT gene, similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>/MTG8 gene.1,2 The existence in nature of EHT ORF was confirmed by direct sequencing of a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplified fragment encompassing the coding sequence from HL60 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (data not shown) </plain></SENT>
