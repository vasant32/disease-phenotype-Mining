<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the genes affected by these changes have not been identified, two critically deleted regions (CDRs) are well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified 76 zebrafish cDNAs orthologous to genes located in these 5q CDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiation hybrid mapping revealed that 33 of the 76 zebrafish orthologs are clustered in a genomic region on linkage group 14 (LG14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen others are located on LG21, and two on LG10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there are large blocks of conserved syntenies, the gene order between human and zebrafish is extensively inverted and transposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, intrachromosomal rearrangements and inversions appear to have occurred more frequently than translocations during evolution from a common chordate ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, of the 33 orthologs located on LG14, three have duplicates on LG21, suggesting that the duplication event occurred early in the evolution of teleosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Murine orthologs of human 5q CDR genes are distributed among three chromosomes, 18, 11, and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The order of genes within the three syntenic mouse chromosomes appears to be more colinear with the human order, suggesting that translocations occurred more frequently than inversions during mammalian evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our comparative map should enhance understanding of the evolution of the del(5q) chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutant fish harboring deletions affecting the 5q CDR syntenic region may provide useful animal models for investigating the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
