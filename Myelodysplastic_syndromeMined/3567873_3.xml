<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serial cytogenetic studies have been performed in four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four a 5q- alteration was present, but with a different pattern of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient presented 5q- as the only alteration since diagnosis; two patients acquired this alteration during the course of the disease; and the fourth showed a 5q- plus other alterations since the first cytogenetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, three of the four patients showed a clone with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and without 5q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to these observations and others from the literature with similar cytogenetic behavior, we have analyzed the following points: 5q- as a primary event and as the only alteration, 5q- as a secondary event, 5q- plus other alterations, and presence of cytogenetically different clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these points suggests that the 5q- alteration can represent an early mutation conferring a slow capacity of expansion to the affected clones, with the possibility of cytogenetic evolution during the progression of the disease (about 30% of the patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 clones with 5q- clones can be a nonrandom event </plain></SENT>
