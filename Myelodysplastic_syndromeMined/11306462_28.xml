<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced activation of caspase-3 was followed by DNA ladder formation in P39 cells, E-64d, an inhibitor of lysosomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> proteases, specifically suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that lysosomal dysfunction induced by a reduction in ATP results in leakage of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosolic compartment and that lysosomal enzyme(s) may be involved in activation of caspase-3 during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in P39 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
