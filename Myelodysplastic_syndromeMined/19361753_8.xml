<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the outcome of 95 patients treated at the University of Chicago with fludarabine melphalan (Flu + Mel) + alemtuzumab conditioning and 59 patients treated at the M.D </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups had similar patient and donor characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in TRM, relapse, survival, and DFS between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of alemtuzumab to an RIC regimen dramatically reduces the incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> undergoing allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
