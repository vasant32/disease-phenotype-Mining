<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study telomerase activity (TA) and its variation in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) at different stages in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells and leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The TA was semi-quantitatively determined in mononuclear cells from 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples, 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at different stages and 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> by using a polymerase chain reaction-enzyme linked immuno-sorben assay (PCR-ELISA) kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TA in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells was in the range of 0 to 0.3 units (U) with a mean of 0.11 +/- 0.08 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3 samples were considered positive in accordance with the standard recommended by the kit's pamphlet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, the TA was ranging from 0 to 0.96 U with a mean value of 0.42 +/- 0.26 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rate was 78.1% which was significantly different from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (BM) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, the average level of TA was 0.27 +/- 0.19 U (ranging from 0 to 0.97 U) with a positive rate of 66.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells, the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> high-risk subgroup exhibited a significantly higher activity of telomerase (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison with INT-1 and INT-2 subgroups in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients based on international prognostic scoring system (IPPS), the difference in TA was also significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abnormality in cell karyotype was not correlated with TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells demonstrate TA at a marginal level while a remarkably increasing level may be seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The BM cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients display a moderate TA among which the high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroup with a poor prognostic IPPS score exhibited markedly higher TA </plain></SENT>
