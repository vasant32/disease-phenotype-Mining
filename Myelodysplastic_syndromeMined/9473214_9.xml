<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the region distal to 1q21 jumps onto numerous different telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a molecular study of the JT involving 1q21 found in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004820'>acute myelomonocytic leukemia</z:hpo> that had transformed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first report describing the analysis of the molecular structure of the JT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the presence of a stretch of telomeric repeats at the breakpoint by means of a fluorescence in situ hybridization experiment, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing of the fused region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant amount of variant telomeric repeats (a telomeric sequence having one-base mismatch within the authentic telomeric repeat TTAGGG) was found in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variant telomeric repeat has been shown to be present in the proximal region of telomeres and does not perform telomeric functions by itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results indicated that the telomeres had already been critically shortened when the jumps occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the extended proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells during the premalignant stage, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, results in <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> due to the loss of telomeric functions </plain></SENT>
