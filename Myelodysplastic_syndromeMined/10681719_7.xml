<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lymphocyte abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have been widely described, but the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these clonal disorders remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An active role of lymphocytes in suppressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis may be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied in vitro and in vivo activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> (CSA) on hematopoiesis in patients affected by hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without blast excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), followed up in our out-patient unit, were treated with CSA at daily doses of 1-3 mg/kg for at least three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low dose steroids or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> were transiently added in 7/9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between pre- and post-treatment parameters were studied by the Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro effect of CSA on circulating hematopoietic progenitors was studied by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> colony assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before treatment, fewer circulating hematopoietic progenitors were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of CD34+ cells was about halved, while circulating erythroid and myeloid colony-forming cells (CFC) were reduced to one-fifth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean period of 22 months of CSA treatment (median: 14.5 months), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was significantly and persistently increased in two patients, platelets in one, platelets and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed transient responses, one patient did not tolerate the treatment and one patient is close to a significant response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At in vitro CSA concentrations similar to those achieved in vivo after oral administration the drug significantly increased cell colony growth in hypoplastic RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This test correctly predicted a positive clinical response to CSA in 3/5 cases and treatment failure in 4/4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: About one half of hypoplastic RA patients benefited from CSA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A larger study could verify whether in vitro culture of hematopoietic progenitors in the presence of CSA can predict the clinical response and whether this treatment could prolong patients' survival </plain></SENT>
