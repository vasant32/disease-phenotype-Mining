<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 103 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients diagnosed and karyotyped at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1387055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Albert</z:e>-Ludwigs University of Freiburg (ALU) between 1993 and 1999, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (CMMoL) displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 19 (+19) as the sole chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three further CMMoL cases with +19 as the single abnormality, two of which previously reported, were collected from other centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and an increased number of ringed sideroblasts was observed in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> (cases 1 and 2), oral steroids (case 3), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (case 4), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>/Ara-C (case 5) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that +19 as the sole anomaly is a rare but recurrent change in CMMoL, in particular of the proliferative type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is at present unclear which gene(s) located on chromosome 19 might have a functional role for the development of this phenotype </plain></SENT>
