<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that thalidomide induced an increase in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit numbers and in IL-10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide also promoted a slight increase in IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in the stromal layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of erythroid burst forming units, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of hematopoietic cells, and VEGF and TNF-α expression levels in culture supernatants were not modulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate a participation of thalidomide upon the hematopoietic microenvironment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, especially in the up regulation of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
