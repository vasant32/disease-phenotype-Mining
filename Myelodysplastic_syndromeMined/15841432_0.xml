<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1982, the French-American-British (FAB) group proposed a classification for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, based on morphological characteristics of peripheral blood and of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Later, cytogenetics proved to be a useful tool for the refinement of prognosis, through the use of the International Prognosis Score System (IPSS), as well as through evidence of clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new classification for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, based on significant modifications of the FAB proposal, with the inclusion of chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic analysis was made of 17 patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the State of Para, based on WHO recommendations, and application of the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good metaphases were obtained for 13 patients; 12 had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and only one had a clonal abnormality, del(3)(p25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genes related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> that have been mapped to 3p are: XPC in 3p25.1 and FANCD2 and VHL in 3p25-26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had classic symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; in the rest the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was excluded or several months of observation before diagnosis were recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, it was not possible to apply IPSS and WHO recommendations, because fundamental data were lacking, specifically the medullary blast and ring sideroblast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We advocate the implementation of routine cytogenetic analyses for the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially in patients with moderate hematopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
