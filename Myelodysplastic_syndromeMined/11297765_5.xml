<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, primed in situ labeling (PRINS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic approaches were used to investigate 54 cases of hematopoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these cases, there were 22 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, 2 cases of tetrasomy 8, 14 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and 16 cases with two copies of both chromosomes 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRINS was carried out in interphase nuclei of bone marrow samples using primers that can specifically detect alpha-satellite DNA sequences of chromosomes 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, using the alpha-satellite probes for chromosomes 7 and 8, FISH was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRINS and FISH techniques showed similar specificity and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison to FISH, PRINS is more advantageous since it is a faster, easier, and more cost-effective technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, for most of the cases, a higher proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was detected in metaphases using conventional cytogenetics, as compared to the one found in interphase nuclei identified with PRINS and FISH techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In other words, for these cases, the cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, had a distinct proliferative advantage compared to the disomic cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to better quantify the proportion of aneuploid cells in bone marrow, we recommend to investigate the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in nuclei using PRINS, rather than studying only the dividing cells as detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
