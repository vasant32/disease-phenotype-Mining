<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients died of nonrelapse causes and five of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality and relapse were 19 and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, 12 patients remain in complete remission (median follow-up: 786 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival probability was 58% </plain></SENT>
