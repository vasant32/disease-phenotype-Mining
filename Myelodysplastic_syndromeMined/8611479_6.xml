<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used restriction fragment length polymorphisms and gene dosage experiments to assess the loss or retention of sequences localized to chromosome 7q in five patients with clonal myeloid disorders and a 7q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletion was interstitial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with retention of the anonymous marker pS194 located at 7q36-qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three out of five cases also retained the more proximal gene T-cell receptor beta (TCR beta) located at 7q35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proximal breakpoints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases were localized to 7q22 by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cases the proximal breakpoint lay between the genes for elastin (ELN) and collagen type 1 alpha (COL1A2) and in three cases distal to this region between the genes for erythropoietin (EPO) and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genes of ACHE, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PLANH1), CCAAT displacement protein (CUTL1) and Met proto-oncogene (MET) were deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the 7q deletion in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath> demonstrates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the breakpoints, supporting a recessive mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
