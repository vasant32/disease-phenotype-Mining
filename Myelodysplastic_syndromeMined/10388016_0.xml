<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the <z:mp ids='MP_0001661'>extended lifespan</z:mp>, a new "natural history" for these syndromes is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these disorders were always classified as "benign" historically, it is now evident that most of these conditions confer an inordinately high predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> occurs as a sequence of events that is driven by genetic damage and by epigenetic changes, the hypothesis is advanced that the first "hit" or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-initiating step is the constitutional genetic mutation, itself, that initially manifests as a single lineage or multiple lineage marrow failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The leukemic promotion and progression steps leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> can then ensue readily in the initiated pool of progenitors or stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the distinction between benign and malignant hematology in the context of the inherited marrow failure disorders has become blurred and new definitions for these syndromes should be developed </plain></SENT>
