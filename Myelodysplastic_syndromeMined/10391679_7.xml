<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that K562 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells ectopically expressing NPM-MLF1, but not those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MLF1, were gradually eliminated from the culture by undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts engineered to overexpress NPM-MLF1 grew normally but serum deprivation triggered apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with slower kinetics than did other well-known apoptotic inducers such as c-Myc or E2F-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of apoptotic induction confirmed that, neither NPM nor MLF1, but the NPM-MLF1 fusion protein was able to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses using a variety of deletion mutants of NPM-MLF1 revealed that induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> required the N-terminal domain of MLF1 and the NPM domain containing nuclear localization signal and that removal of the NPM dimerization domain markedly impaired the ability to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of Bcl-2 rescued NIH3T3 fibroblasts from NPM-MLF1-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> without affecting the expression level or the subcellular localization of NPM-MLF1 and enabled cells to progress into S phase in low serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings provide an NPM-MLF1-mediated novel mechanism of apoptotic induction and imply that NPM-MLFI in collaboration with anti-apoptotic oncoproteins may play an important role in multi-step progression from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
