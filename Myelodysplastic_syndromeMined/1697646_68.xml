<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although colony-stimulating factors have been shown to accelerate recovery from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> after intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, their use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> has been controversial because in vitro they stimulate leukemic colonies as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) after a standard course of intensive therapy in 108 patients with relapsed or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (67 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, 30 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with granulocyte CSF (200 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area per day in a 30-minute infusion) was begun two days after the end of the chemotherapy and continued until the neutrophil count rose above 1500 per cubic millimeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with granulocyte CSF accelerated the recovery of neutrophils significantly (P less than 0.01), shortening it by about a week, but it had no effect on platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of febrile episodes was almost the same, documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were significantly less frequent in the group treated with granulocyte CSF (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that granulocyte CSF accelerated the regrowth of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of 48 patients in the CSF group who could be evaluated and 36 percent of 50 controls had complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of relapse was almost the same in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It appears that recombinant human granulocyte CSF is safe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, accelerating neutrophil recovery and thereby reducing the incidence of documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> without affecting the regrowth of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It should be used with caution, however, pending further confirmation of these early results </plain></SENT>
