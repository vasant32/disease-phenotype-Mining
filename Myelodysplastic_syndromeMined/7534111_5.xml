<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a series of polymorphic markers mapped to chromosome 7 to test this hypothesis in 22 children with MPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 19 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the percentage of patient bone marrow samples heterozygous at each locus tested was similar to the frequency observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas these data demonstrate that submicroscopic loss of large segments of chromosome 7 alleles is uncommon in children with MPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who do not have Mo 7, they do not exclude small deletions around an uncharacterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a number of distinct molecular events contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, and we propose a multistep model to explain the similarities and differences between the major subtypes of childhood MPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
