<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 496 consecutive individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent hematopoietic stem cell mobilization using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and G-CSF and first autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, increased apheresis days as a continuous and as a categorical variable at ≥5/&lt;5 days significantly predicted neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apheresis days fell just short of significance (P=0.06) as a predictor of platelet recovery in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased apheresis days (as both continuous and categorical variables) were also predictive of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent ≥5 days of pheresis had significantly worse survival (P=0.001) than patients with less pheresis days owing to significantly higher relapse mortality (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
