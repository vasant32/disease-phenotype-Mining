<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of flow cytometry (FCM) in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) remains controversial, because analysis of myeloid maturation may involve subjective interpretation of sometimes subtle patterns on multiparameter FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using six-parameter marker combinations known to be useful in evaluating the myeloid compartment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we measured objective immunophenotypic differences between non-neoplastic (n = 25) and dysplastic (n = 17) granulopoiesis using a novel method, called Fisher information nonparametric embedding (FINE), that measures information distances among FCM datasets modeled as individual high-dimensional probability density functions, rather than as sets of two-dimensional histograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information-preserving component analysis (IPCA) was used to create information-optimized "rotated" two-dimensional histograms for visualizing myelopoietic immunophenotypes for each individual sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a consistent trend of segregation of higher-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) from benign by FINE analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference was accentuated in cases with morphologic dysgranulopoiesis and in cases with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, lower grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or cases that lacked morphologic dysgranulopoiesis showed much greater overlap with non-neoplastic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases of reactive left shift were consistently embedded within the higher-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IPCA yielded two-dimensional histogram projections for each individual case by relative weighting of measured cellular characteristics, optimized for preserving information distances derived through FINE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Objective analysis by information geometry supports the conclusions of previous studies that there are immunophenotypic differences in the maturation patterns of benign granulopoiesis and high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but also reinforces the known pitfalls of overlap between low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and benign granulopoiesis and overlap between reactive granulocytic left shifts and dysplastic granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
