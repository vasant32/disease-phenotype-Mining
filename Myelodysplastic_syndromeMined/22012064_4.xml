<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a physical and functional interaction between RUNX1 (AML1) and MLL and show that both are required to maintain the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> lysine 4 trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) at 2 critical regulatory regions of the AML1 target gene PU.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar to CBFβ, we show that MLL binds to AML1 abrogating its proteasome-dependent degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a subset of previously uncharacterized frame-shift and missense mutations at the N terminus of AML1, found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, impairs its interaction with MLL, resulting in loss of the H3K4me3 mark within PU.1 regulatory regions, and decreased PU.1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction between MLL and AML1 provides a mechanism for the sequence-specific binding of MLL to DNA, and identifies RUNX1 target genes as potential effectors of MLL function </plain></SENT>
