<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few studies have tested the benefits of using peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts versus bone marrow (BM) grafts for unrelated donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet there has been a substantial change in clinical practice, with increasing numbers of adults receiving unrelated donor PBSC grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared outcomes after 331 PBSC and 586 BM transplants in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) who were followed for a median of 3 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBSC recipients were less likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, to have poor performance scores, and to be transplanted more recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of grades 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (58% versus 45%, P &lt; .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) (56% versus 42%, P &lt; .001) were significantly higher with PBSC than with BM transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of grade II-IV aGVHD were similar with PBSC and BM transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year probabilities of treatment-related mortality (TRM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> recurrence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free, and overall survival (OS) were similar in the 2 groups with 3-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival rates of 30% and 32% after transplantation of PBSC and BM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike results after HLA-matched sibling donor PBSC transplants, we did not identify a survival advantage with PBSC grafts in patients receiving unrelated donor transplants for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher rate of cGVHD after PBSC transplants and, consequently, more frequent late adverse events warrant extended follow up of PBSC recipients </plain></SENT>
