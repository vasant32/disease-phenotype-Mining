<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in particular those with intermediate-2 (Int-2) and high-risk disease, have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of treatment includes cytoxic chemotherapy and supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last decade, promising results from studies focusing on hypomethylating agents, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (5-aza-deoxycytidine) and 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, have led to the expansion of the therapeutic arsenal for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents the current data available on the clinical efficacy and safety profile for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> as a treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not fully understood, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>'s antitumor activity may involve its ability to induce hypomethylation and reactivation of genes responsible for cellular differentiation, stimulate an immune response, induce DNA damage/apoptotic response pathways, and/or augment stem cell renewal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies that use epigenetic therapies that combine hypomethylating agents with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and head-to-head comparison studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> and 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> will provide valuable pre-clinical and clinical data, enhancing our understanding of these drugs </plain></SENT>
