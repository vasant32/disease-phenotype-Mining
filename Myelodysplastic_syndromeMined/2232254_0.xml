<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the activity of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and its isozyme in 36 leukemic patients (16 ANLL, 11 ALL, and 9 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 8 MDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isozyme was measured by erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25589">nonyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (EHNA) inhibitory assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This assay was simple and reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance rate of abnormally high <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> value were 81.24% for ANLL, 100% for ALL, 77.8% for <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 37.5% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> level became high when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> turned into overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isozyme pattern, there was a clear difference between ANLL and ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The isozyme I/II ratio was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in ALL than ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic crisis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> also had a high isozyme I/II ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between isozyme I and absolute number of peripheral blasts in ALL (r = 0.768) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When observed time sequentially, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and isozyme changed correlatively with the number of blasts counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and its isozyme are useful parameters both for leukemic diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
