<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biology of rHuEpo effect on erythropoiesis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, until more biological information is obtained, it could be prudent to consider these response patterns as guidelines in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the small but interesting series of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> only one responded to rHuEpo within the treatment period of eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients continued the treatment on their own, and after 16 weeks a response was noted for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third patient was treated for only six weeks and a delayed response was recorded while off treatment for ten weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This response was also recorded 16 weeks from treatment initiation-as in the other two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A fourth patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed transfusion related <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> and during iron chelation therapy the RBC transfusion rate dropped to a rate lower than the rate needed before the rHuEpo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is emphasized that in non responders, non-routine approaches should be considered </plain></SENT>
