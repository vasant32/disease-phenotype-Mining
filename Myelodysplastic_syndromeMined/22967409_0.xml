<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of in vitro CFC and correlation with other related laboratory tests in 155 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were analyzed retrospectively, and to compare with data of in vitro CFC in 122 newly diagnosed NSAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median number of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) was 9 (0 - 157)/10(5) bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC), colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) 30 (0 - 425)/10(5)BMMNC and colony forming unit-granulocytes/macrophages (CFU-GM) 14 (0 - 125)/10(5)BMMNC in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, being significantly lower than those in healthy control; number of BFU-E and/or CFU-E was lower than the lower limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control in 66 cases (42.6%), CFU-GM lower in 3 cases (1.9%) and BFU-E and/or CFU-E with CFU-GM lower in 70 cases (45.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cluster/CFU-GM ratio was significantly lower in low blast group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> &lt; 5% blast in bone marrow smear) than that in high blast group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> â‰¥ 5% blast) (0.65 vs 1.0, P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of each type of CFC was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group than that in NSAA group (BFU-E 9 vs 5/10(5)BMMNC, P = 0.017; CFU-E 30 vs 19.5/10(5)BMMNC, P = 0.023; CFU-GM 14 vs 10/10(5)BMMNC, P = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive correlation between BFU-E and CFU-E were revealed in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and NSAA group (r(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) = 0.712, P = 0.000 and r(NSAA) = 0.757, P = 0.000), with a lower correlation coefficient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> present markedly decreased hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>), and particularly in erythroid progenitors extensively and severely </plain></SENT>
