<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our analysis we used the SybrGreen technology and gene-specific primers for the qRT-PCR analysis of 10 genes, in cDNA of PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and K562 cell lines, treated by 1 micromole of 5-Aza for 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNMT1 and DNMT3A showed statistically significant decrease of expression in 5-Aza-treated PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells, whereas DNMT3B showed significantly decreased expression in 5-Aza-treated K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The members of the Bcl- 2 family of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-regulating genes Bcl-2 and Bax showed statistically significant differences in expression, in comparison with non-treated PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our most interesting result was the significant upregulation (re-expression) of p15, in 5-Aza-treated PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The re-expression of p15 in PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line evaluated by qRT-PCR makes this novel cell line a suitable model for the studies of pharmacologic demethylation as a plausible mechanism resulting in hematologic response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
