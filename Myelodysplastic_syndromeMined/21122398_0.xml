<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficiency and side-effects of the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) and thalidomide in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of thirty-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> or-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> were treated with CsA in combination with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial CsA dose of 3 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1) was administered, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had their CsA blood concentration concurrently monitored until it reached and maintained between 100 and 200 µg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial dose of thalidomide was 50 mg/d, with increasing dose of 50 mg every week until the maximum of 200 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hematological response was assessed according to the modified criteria of the International Working Group, and adverse events were graded with the Common Toxicity Criteria (v3.0) of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response duration and overall survival of the patients were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 19/37 cases (51.4%) achieved hematologic improvement (HI)-erythroid response (HI-E), 9/29 cases (31.0%) HI-platelet response (HI-P) and 7/33 cases (21.2%) HI-neutrophil response (HI-N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>15 of 32 transfusion-dependent patients (46.9%) achieved transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median response duration of HI-E, HI-P and HI-N were 88 (4 - 88) weeks, 78 (8 - 84(+)) weeks and 78 (10 - 84(+)) weeks respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 52 months on a 29 (4 - 103) months median follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some patients developed grades I-II hepatic or nephritic impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e> or numbness, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were tolerable and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No grade III or severer adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CsA in combination with thalidomide appears to be effective mainly in inducing HI-E and relatively well-tolerated for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
