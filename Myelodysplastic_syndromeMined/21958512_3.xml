<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) blast count is an essential parameter for classification and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a high degree of cell atypias in bone marrow hemopoietic cells may be found in this group of clonal disorders, making it difficult to quantify precisely myeloblasts, and to distinguish them from promyelocytes and atypical immature myeloid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether computerized image analysis of routine cytology would help to characterize these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa stained BM smears of 30 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 19 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM, nuclei of blasts and promyelocytes were digitalized and interactively segmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphological classification of the cells was done by consensus of two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immature granulocytic precursors, which could not be clearly classified either as blasts or promyelocytes, were called "atypic myeloid precursors" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear morphometry and texture features derived from the co-occurrence matrix and fractal dimension (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM, when compared to myeloblasts, nuclei of promyelocytes showed significant increase in perimeter and local texture homogeneity and a decrease in form factor, chromatin gray levels, Haralick's entropy, inertia, energy, contrast, diagonal moment, cluster prominence, the fractal dimension according to Minkowski and its goodness-of-fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloblast nuclei, the chromatin texture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> myeloblasts revealed higher local homogeneity and goodness-of-fit of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>, but lower values of entropy, contrast, diagonal moment, and fractal dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same differences were found between nuclei of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promyelocytes and those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nuclei of atypical myeloid precursors showed intermediate characteristics between those of blasts and promyelocytes according to the quantitative features (perimeter, form factor, gray level and its standard deviation), but were similar to promyelocytes according to the texture variables inertia, energy, contrast, diagonal moment, cluster prominence, and Minkowski's fractal dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BM atypical immature myeloid precursors are difficult to be correctly classified in routine cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although their cytoplasm is more similar to that of myeloblasts, computerized texture analysis indicates a nuclear chromatin remodeling more close to the promyelocyte, thus indicating an asynchronous intermediate maturation stage between blast and promyelocyte </plain></SENT>
