<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: GSTT1, GSTM1 and NQO1(C609T) genotypes were detected in 52 MDS patients and 241 unrelated controls by PCR or PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotype was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In individuals with GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotype, the odds ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> risk were elevated to 2.873 (95% CI: 1.491-5.537) and 3.591 (95% CI: 1.717-7.508), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased frequency of GSTT(1) null genotype among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and increased frequency of GSTM1 null genotype among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with chromosome abnormalities were found as compared to controls (OR = 5.336, P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, OR = 3.740, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of NQO1(C609T) genotypes between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Determination of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes may be used as a stratification marker to predicate high-risk individuals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
