<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The applied MRI technique has earlier been validated for quantitative determination of the liver iron concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method involves cardiac gating and may, therefore, also be used for simultaneous evaluation of myocardial iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissue signal intensities were measured from spin echo images and the myocardium/muscle signal intensity ratio was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SI ratio was converted to tissue iron concentration values based on a modified calibration curve from the liver model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crucial steps of the method were optimized; i.e. recognition and selection of the myocardial slice for analysis and positioning of the regions of interest (ROIs) within the myocardium and the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This made the myocardial MRI measurements sufficiently reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We applied this method in 41 multiply transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate significant positive linear relationships between different iron store parameters and the MRI-derived myocardial iron concentration, which was significantly related to the serum ferritin concentration (rho=0.62, P&lt;0.0001) and to the MRI-determined liver iron concentration (rho=0.36, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The myocardial MRI iron concentrations demonstrated also a significant positive correlation with the number of blood units given (rho=0.45, P=0.005) and the aminotransferase serum concentration (rho=0.54, P=0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data represents indirect evidence for the ability of MRI techniques based on myocardium/muscle signal intensity ratio measurements to evaluate myocardial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
