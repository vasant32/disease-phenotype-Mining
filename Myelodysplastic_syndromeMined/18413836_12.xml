<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that MG98, an oligonucleotide antisense to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), could reverse malignant phenotypes by down-regulating DNMT1 and inducing reexpression of hypermethylated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phase I study was conducted to determine a biologically effective dose and describe the safety of MG98 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 11) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 12) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biologically effective dose was defined as the dose at which &gt; or =50% of patients experienced &gt;50% reduction in DNMT1 expression with acceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Escalating doses of MG98 were administered according to two schedules (2-hour i.v. bolus followed by 5-day continuous i.v. infusion every 14 days, or 14-day continuous i.v. infusion every 21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNMT1 down-regulation was observed in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, biologically effective dose was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reexpression of target genes (P15, WIT1, and ER) was observed in 12 patients but did not correlate with DNMT1 down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Escalation was stopped due to dose-limiting toxicities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No objective clinical response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease stabilization occurred in 6 (26%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No pharmacodynamic or clinical activity was observed at MG98 doses and schedules administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite this, pursuing DNMT1 down-regulation remains a sound approach for targeting aberrant epigenetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies with different formulation and/or doses and schedules will be required to ensure efficient MG98 intracellular uptake and fully evaluate its therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
