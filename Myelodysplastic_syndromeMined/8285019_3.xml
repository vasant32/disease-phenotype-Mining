<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rhEPO was given 3 times a week at doses of 75-250 U/kg body weight, over a maximum period of 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients (38%) showed a response to rhEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rhEPO was well tolerated and without relevant side effects throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responding patients had low but detectable pretreatment circulating erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E) and the response to rhEPO was associated with a significant increase in BFU-E (p &lt; 0.01); concentrations of serum transferrin receptor (TfR) also consistently rose in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations did not significantly differ between responders and nonresponders, although 4 out of the 5 responders had relatively low levels of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, subcutaneous rhEPO administration appears to be an effective treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in a substantial subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relatively low baseline EPO concentrations, detectable pretreatment circulating BFU-E and an early increase in the serum concentrations of TfR seem to be criteria for predicting response to rhEPO in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
