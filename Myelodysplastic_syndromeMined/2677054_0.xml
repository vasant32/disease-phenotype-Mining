<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty bone marrow samples were studied, including controls, and different myeloproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained using factor VIII related antigen (F VIII RAg) immunolabelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-actin is as good a marker for megakaryocytes as anti-FVIIIRAg and is potentially clinically useful when morphological identification is difficult, when bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is unsuccessful, or when quantitative evaluation of tissue sections is required </plain></SENT>
