<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these unbalanced rearrangements often combine two recurrent deletions, they could be an efficient mechanism for the loss of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in a single step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that dicentric chromosomes involving chromosome 20 with loss of the 20q12 putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene are often the result of more complex rearrangements, with the 20q12 region being lost by an interstitial deletion independent of the site of translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found interstitial deletions of 20q in two thirds of the two-way translocations tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This points to a more complex mechanism of translocation involving at least three breakpoints and two separate events, and raises questions about the order of these events and the significance of these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
