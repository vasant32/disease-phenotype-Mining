<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that high levels of cellular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein correlated with short survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As VEGF exerts its effects via two receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2, we evaluated the significance of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 protein levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and their relationship to VEGF protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and radioimmunoassay confirmed and quantified specific protein levels in bone marrow samples from 41 MDS and 66 AML previously untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGFR-1 levels were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.0004), but no significant difference was found in the VEGFR-2 levels (P = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between VEGFRs levels and duration of survival was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF protein levels were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed increasing VEGF levels to significantly correlate with shorter survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = 0.008), a finding similar to our previous report of the inverse relationship between VEGF levels and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0000001 andP &lt; 0.0002 respectively) but not between VEGF and VEGFR-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that VEGF expression, rather than the expression of its receptors, is the determining factor in the biological behaviour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that VEGFRs are differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
