<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of subtypes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was determined in a prospective series of 176 patients presenting at 28 Shanghai hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was established in a single laboratory, analyzing morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic data, using the World Health Organization (WHO) revised classification and directly compared to the French American British (FAB) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a striking increase in the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> in younger patients relative to other subtypes (WHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was 26.5% (WHO) and 31% (FAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered lesions were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, del(20)q, del(7q), and del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with previously reported age-dependent differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and a decreased frequency of del(5q) abnormalities between China and the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results also indicate that multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is a prominent feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developing in younger individuals in Shanghai and suggest distinguishing between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> and RA may be important in the design of studies to further understand regional differences in subtype prevalence and to elucidate the pathogenesis of this complex and multifactorial disease </plain></SENT>
