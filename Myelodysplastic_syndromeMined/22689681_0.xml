<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The RUNX1 (AML1) gene is a frequent mutational target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that RUNX1 mutations may have pathological and prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 93 patients with cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> for RUNX1 mutations by capillary sequencing of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation status was then correlated with clinical data and gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 15 out of 93 (16.1%) patients with cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> had RUNX1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients were enrolled in the AMLCG-99 trial and carried ten RUNX1 mutations (13.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these 73 patients RUNX1 mutations were significantly associated with older age, male sex, absence of NPM1 mutations and presence of MLL-partial tandem duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RUNX1-mutated patients had a lower complete remission rate (30% versus 73% P=0.01), lower relapse-free survival rate (3-year relapse-free survival 0% versus 30.4%; P=0.002) and lower overall survival rate (3-year overall survival 0% versus 34.4%; P&lt;0.001) than patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RUNX1 mutations remained associated with shorter overall survival in a multivariate model including age and the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Net <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> genetic classification as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with RUNX1 mutations showed a unique gene expression pattern with differential expression of 85 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most prominently up-regulated genes in patients with RUNX1-mutated cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> include lymphoid regulators such as HOP homeobox (HOPX), deoxynucleotidyltransferase (DNTT, terminal) and B-cell linker (BLNK), indicating lineage infidelity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings firmly establish that RUNX1 mutations are a marker of poor prognosis and provide insights into the pathogenesis of RUNX1 mutation-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
