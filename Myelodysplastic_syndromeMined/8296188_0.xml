<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurring clonal cytogenetic abnormalities may be divided into those exclusively associated with myeloid disorders, those uniquely observed in lymphoid diseases, and those detected in both myeloid and lymphoid hemopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several of the common defects are characteristic of specific FAB types or subtypes and are associated with specific clinico pathologic syndromes and clinical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities have served to define relatively homogeneous subsets of malignant hemopathies which are not evident from morphological and other available markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic findings have been demonstrated to be powerful indicators in predicting clinical course and outcome in patients and in guiding their management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the significant progress made in the treatment of malignant hemopathies, it is very important to identify parameters which may be used to predict whether patients will respond favorably to standard therapies or if they are unlikely to do so and require alternative strategies, such as bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies have also provided important insights into the understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a number of recurring chromosome translocations characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the genes that are located at the breakpoints have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis has revealed that alteration in expression of these genes or in the properties of the encoded proteins resulting from the rearrangements plays an integral part in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies of clonality have suggested that several chromosome abnormalities may arise in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, whereas others may originate in cells of more restricted lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The author focuses first on the implications of the karyotype in the diagnosis and the prognosis of myeloproliferative syndromes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, then on the interest of describing new clinical-cytogenetic associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, some of the recent results obtained in a cytogenetic study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
