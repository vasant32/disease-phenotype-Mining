<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of aurora A has been observed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and some hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, but little is known about its expression in myeloid diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cytogenetic abnormalities play an essential role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, we hypothesized that aurora A deregulation may be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and contribute to the <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> observed in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed aurora A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients serving as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) blasts were isolated from bone marrow aspirate specimens using magnetic activated cell separation technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from purified CD34(+) cells, and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for aurora A was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analyses for total aurora A, phosphorylated aurora A, Ki-67, and activated caspase 3 were performed on cytospin slides made from purified CD34(+) cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients using standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aurora A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were correlated, as was aurora A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, with blast counts, cytogenetic abnormalities, and International Prognostic Scoring System score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that CD34(+) cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> expressed aurora A at significantly higher levels (P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aurora A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels correlated with total and phosphorylated protein levels (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between aurora A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and blast count, blast viability, cytogenetic abnormalities, or the International Prognostic Scoring System score in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that aurora A is up-regulated in CD34(+) blasts from myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
