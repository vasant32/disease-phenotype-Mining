<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We treated 24 patients with AZA (100 mg/m(2), 5 days) plus valproate (VPA; continuous dosing, trough serum level 80-110 μg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to WHO classification, 5 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>, and 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (29%) had previously received intensive chemotherapy, and five had previous HDAC inhibitor treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 37% in the entire cohort but significantly higher (57%) in previously untreated patients, especially those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven (29%) patients achieved CR (29%) and two PR (8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematological CR was accompanied by complete cytogenetic remission according to conventional cytogenetics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some patients also showed complete remission according to FISH on bone marrow mononuclear cells and CD34(+) peripheral blood cells, as well as by follow-up of somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four additional patients achieved at least marrow remissions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This trial is the first to assess the combination of AZA plus VPA without additional ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A comparatively good CR rate, relatively short time to response, and the influence of VPA serum levels on response suggest that VPA provided substantial additional benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the importance of HDAC inhibitors in epigenetic combination therapy can only be proven by randomized trials </plain></SENT>
