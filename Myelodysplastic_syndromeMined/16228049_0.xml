<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess, in vitro, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">Amifostine</z:chebi> (AMF, WR-2721) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted from hemopoietic stem/progenitor cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted the study in the research laboratories of the Hashemite University, Jordan between September 2003 and January 2005 where we took samples were from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and healthy donors attending Al-Hussein <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center and We determined the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in cultures supplemented with media conditioned with AMF-treated and AMF-untreated pure hemopoietic cells [CD34+ cells, and erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic progenitors] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the same conditioned media, we evaluated levels of elaborated VEGF by a sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biologically, media conditioned with AMF-treated cells reduced proliferation of HUVECs compared to media conditioned with untreated control cells (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cultures of AMF-untreated cells, elaboration of VEGF was higher (p&lt;0.05) in media conditioned with cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 30 minutes pre-exposure of cells to AMF (500 mM) suppressed levels of VEGF secreted within 24 hours in 63 of 89 evaluated cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of reduction of VEGF in AMF-sensitive cultures was comparable in cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells (18%, 2-37%; median, range) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (12%, 2-45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results showed that AMF exerts an anti-angiogenic activity and suppresses the secretion of VEGF in hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells obtained from both healthy individuals and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
