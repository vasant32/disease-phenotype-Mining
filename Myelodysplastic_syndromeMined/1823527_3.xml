<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient served as his or her own control and received sequential, randomized courses of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> or an identical placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The need for platelet transfusions due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and the total number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes were compared for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> and placebo courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received platelet transfusions at the discretion of their personal physician and kept detailed records of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of three patients who completed the full study, none had a reduction in the need for platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the eight patients who participated in the study, there was no reduction in number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> treatment as compared to the number with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the prophylactic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> does not decrease dependence on platelet transfusions or decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
