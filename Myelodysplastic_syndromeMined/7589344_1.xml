<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow from 65 patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) was tested for stroma growth in short term cultures (2 weeks) and for colony formation by haemopoietic precursor cells during the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 18 untreated patients, mean stroma growth was 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and colony formation was virtually absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment with immunosuppression (IS), as estimated from 90 examinations in 54 patients, stroma growth was approximately 50% and colony growth approximately 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth impairment of stroma and haemopoietic precursors persisted for 10 and more years after IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of 2-week stroma cultures were compared with results of long term bone marrow cultures in 10 AA patients and 4 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks, growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> was delayed compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but this difference became less evident with prolonged incubation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormalities</z:hpo> were compared with the clinical evolution after IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of late haematological complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), did not correlate with the degree of stroma growth impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, relapse of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was associated with poor stroma growth: 8/29 patients with stroma confluence of &lt; or = 30% during haematological remission versus 1/25 with stroma confluence of &gt; 30% relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (i) the haematopoietic microenvironment is frequently coinvolved in the disease process of AA, (ii) a defect is detected in short term rather than in long term stroma cultures and, (iii) relapse is more frequent in patients with poor stroma growth </plain></SENT>
