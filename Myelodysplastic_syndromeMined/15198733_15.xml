<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clonal haemopoiesis may develop following stem cell transplantation and precede the development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, accelerated telomere shortening may be induced by replicative stress or oxidative damage, leading to genomic instability, and inactivating polymorphisms of the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (NQO1) are more frequently observed in patients with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied clonal haemopoiesis, telomere length and NQO1 status in 146 patients receiving conventional chemotherapy for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal haemopoiesis was demonstrated in eight of 98 (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was reduced in patients following chemotherapy (n = 52) compared with controls (n = 42) (P &lt; 0.001), particularly in those with clonal haemopoiesis (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whilst there was a trend towards telomere shortening in control subjects polymorphic for NQO1-187Ser (n = 12), chemotherapy-exposed patients polymorphic for the NQO1-187Ser allele (n = 29) had significantly shorter telomeres (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, chemotherapy-treated patients with the NQO1-187Ser, polymorphism were more likely to develop clonal haemopoiesis than patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> NQO1 (odds ratio = 7; 1.16-42.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a switch to clonal haemopoiesis may occur after conventional chemotherapy and lead to accelerated telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with the NQO1-187Ser polymorphism have an increased risk of developing both clonal haemopoiesis and telomere shortening, which may partly explain the predisposition to t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in NQO1-187Ser null individuals </plain></SENT>
