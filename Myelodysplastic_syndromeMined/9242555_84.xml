<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because wt1 has been shown to be expressed in the vast majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), we investigated the relevance of wt-1 mRNA expression regarding prognosis and possible prediction of relapse during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Totally bone marrow-derived blasts of 139 AML patients (129 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, 22 AML patients again in first relapse, and 10 AML patients analyzed primarily in first relapse) were studied for wt1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients were analyzed for wt1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>wt1-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and the amplification product was visually classified as not, weakly, moderately, or strongly amplified, as described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR products were quantitated by competitive PCR using a shortened homologous wt1 construct standard in representative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of wt1 transcripts was correlated to age, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, phenotype, karyotype, and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>wt1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detectable in 124 of 161 (77%) samples at diagnosis and in first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>wt1 expression was independent from age, antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or FAB subtype, with the exception of a significant difference in M5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> showing wt1 transcripts in only 40% (P = .0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the level of wt1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and response to treatment or the prognostic groups defined by the karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concerning long-term survival, patients with high levels of wt1 had a significantly worse overall survival (OS) than those with not detectable or low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 3-year OS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> was 13% and 38% (P = .038), respectively, and 12% and 43% (P = .014) for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The difference was more distinct in patients less than 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieving complete remission became wt1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reoccurrence of wt1 transcripts predicted relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that high expression of wt1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is associated with a worse long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
