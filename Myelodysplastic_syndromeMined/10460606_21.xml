<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on diagnostic and prognostic relevance of karyotype aberrations have prompted the development of scores including cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess and compare the explanatory power of different scoring systems and to assess the additional explanatory power of cytogenetics by evaluating the clinical and laboratory data of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data of 386 MDS patients was available, with cytogenetic analysis at time of diagnosis in 256 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical/morphological scores: Bournemouth, modified Bournemouth and DÃ¼sseldorf; and scores including cytogenetics: Lausanne-Bournemouth, Lille and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), were calculated and their predictive power was compared for both overall survival and preleukaemic duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the scores had significant correlation on both endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calculating the prognostic value of different cytogenetic aberrations we found that differentiating between evidence for no aberration, single aberrations excluding chromosomes 7 and 8, aberrations on chromosomes 5, 7 or 8 and complex aberrations was important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data were incorporated in a 'prognostic index cytogenetics' (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic scores significantly improved the prognostic value of the best clinical/morphological score in regard to both overall survival and preleukaemic duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data further stress the importance of cytogenetics for predicting prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
