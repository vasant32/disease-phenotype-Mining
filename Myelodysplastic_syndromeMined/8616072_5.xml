<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of splenectomy in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hazards of operating on a severely pancytopenic patient, the fear of compromising the patient's immune function, and the improvement of non-surgical treatment have made splenectomy unpopular in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated positive and adverse effects of splenectomy in 80 patients with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (SAA) treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (group A), using 52 nonsplenectomized ALG patients as controls (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonfatal complications of surgery occurred in 10 (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy induced a significant increase of peripheral blood neutrophils, reticulocytes and platelets within 2 weeks, followed by a continuous increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values over the following weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>28/132 patients (21%) developed a late clonal disorder of haemopoiesis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their incidence was identical in groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13/28 (59%) died, 10/17 (59%) in group A and 3/11 (27%) in group B (not significant (n.s.)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall probability of survival at 18 years after ALG was 51+/-6% for group A and 61+/-7% for group B (n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that splenectomy in AA is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It induces an immediate increase of peripheral blood counts and, thereafter, a continuous improvement of haemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It does not increase the incidence of late clonal complications but has a borderline effect on mortality from these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy should be reconsidered in selective nontransplanted patients who have prolonged transfusion requirements despite otherwise optimal treatment </plain></SENT>
