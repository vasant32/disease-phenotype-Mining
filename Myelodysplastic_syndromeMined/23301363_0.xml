<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to identify cellular and cytogenetic markers of prognostic relevance to survival of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases had a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic CD34+ cells and anti-apoptotic survivin+ cells than controls, particularly for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8+ cells showed a significant positive correlation with apoptotic CD34+ cells and capacity for colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter was significantly lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>-8-negative cases than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, while that oftrisomy 8 cases was comparable to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that although <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 cells are in a pro-apoptotic state, they are checked by the enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic signals which provide them with their proliferative advantage </plain></SENT>
