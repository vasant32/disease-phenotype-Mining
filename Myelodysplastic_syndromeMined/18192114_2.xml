<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical course of a patient who experienced refractory pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) after undergoing HLA-matched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts in transformation that had evolved from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) developing from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e> syndrome has not been standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated this patient with allo-PBSCT using a regimen combining high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, in addition to total body irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without preceding intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donor was ABO incompatible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloid and platelet recoveries were achieved rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythroid engraftment was not evident, however, and the patient was given a diagnosis of PRCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regimen-related toxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PRCA did not respond to various therapies, including the discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> for the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, human recombinant erythropoietin, immunosuppressive treatment with steroids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and human anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient received transfusions 48 times until the resolution of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> by donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) at 25 months after PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He is now clinically well (performance status, 100%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell counts at 5 years after SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An in vitro study demonstrated that serum from the recipient blocked the differentiation of erythroid cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the conditioning regimen we describe seems safe and effective for those who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and that DLI might be a valuable approach for refractory PRCA after ABO-incompatible SCT </plain></SENT>
