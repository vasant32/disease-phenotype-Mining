<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 193 survivors, diagnosed between 1970-1986, who were followed in our center's After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Experience Program and are participants in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Survivor Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 49% were female and 25% were racial/ethnic minorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was determination of the cumulative percentage of patients having an abnormal CBC by 2 or 3 standard deviations (SDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four components of the CBC were examined and employed to define an abnormal CBC: low white blood cell count (WBC), <z:mp ids='MP_0002590'>high mean corpuscular volume</z:mp> (MCV), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo>, and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of treatment exposures to abnormal values was assessed with a multilevel logistic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1297 patient visits during 1401 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean number of visits per survivor was 6.7 (SD 4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative percentage of subjects with at least one abnormal CBC was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative percent of subjects with a value abnormal by 2 SD was WBC = 23%, MCV = 37%, platelets = 9%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> = 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For values abnormal by 3 SD, the frequencies were WBC = 3%, MCV = 20%, platelets = 1%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> = 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or a secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Exposure to epipodophyllotoxins was associated with an increased risk of having abnormally <z:mp ids='MP_0002590'>high MCV</z:mp> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mildly abnormal CBC values are common in survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal values are often of questionable significance but seem to persist over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Epipodophyllotoxin therapy was found to be associated with increased frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002590'>high MCV</z:mp> levels </plain></SENT>
