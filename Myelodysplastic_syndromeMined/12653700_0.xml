<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology from a papule on the left shoulder showed a dense dermal infiltrate of large mononuclear cells which were positive for leucocyte common antigen, KP1 and PGM1, with an MIB-1 proliferating fraction of 40%, diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> monocytic (M5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cutis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Full blood count revealed pancytopaenia but no blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirate showed reduced red cell precursors and 10% blasts, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed with a 3 unit transfusion of packed red cells, after which his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> resolved within 6 weeks and his peripheral blood counts returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
