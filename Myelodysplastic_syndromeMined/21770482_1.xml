<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has used its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) programme to assess several drugs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically, the evidence submitted by the manufacturer comes from one short-term randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating improvement in overall survival and/or in delay of disease progression, and these are the pre-eminent drivers of cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We draw attention to key issues encountered in assessing the quality and rigour of the manufacturers' modelling of overall survival and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our examples are two recent STAs: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50928">Nexavar</z:chebi>®) for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (Vidaza®) for higher-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The choice of parametric model had a large effect on the predicted treatment-dependent survival gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logarithmic models (log-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and log-logistic) delivered double the survival advantage that was derived from Weibull models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both submissions selected the logarithmic fits for their base-case economic analyses and justified selection solely on Akaike Information Criterion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> scores in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> submission failed to match the choice of the log-logistic over Weibull or exponential models, and the modelled survival in the intervention arm lacked face validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> scores for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> models favoured log-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> fits; however, since there is no statistical method for comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> scores, and differences may be trivial, it is generally advised that the plausibility of competing models should be tested against external data and explored in diagnostic plots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Function fitting to observed data should not be a mechanical process validated by a single crude indicator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Projective models should show clear plausibility for the patients concerned and should be consistent with other published information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple rather than single parametric functions should be explored and tested with diagnostic plots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When trials have survival curves with <z:mp ids='MP_0002758'>long tails</z:mp> exhibiting few events then the robustness of extrapolations using information in such tails should be tested </plain></SENT>
